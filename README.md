# Skills companies ask for in a Data Analyst

A study on the skills required by companies for Data Analysts (at least from what they say in their job ads) - based in 40K job ads scraped from Linkedin.

Some preliminary results:

## Goals

Obtain large pool of job ad descriptions found on Linkedin (and maybe other websites) to later analyze and determine which characteristics are the most requested for a Data Analyst all over the world
Also:
-What are the most required skills?
-How many job ads mention R, SQL, Python, etc.
-How about salary? Can a Data Analyst expect a higher salary based on their skillset?

## Roadmap

- [ ] Set up a pipeline to process new data scraped from Linkedin
- [ ] Expand keywords to roles such as "Product Analyst", "Analytics Engineer", and others
- [ ] Train ML models to predict salary based on skills, requisites and other characteristics of the job
