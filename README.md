# In-demand skills for Data Analysts according to thousands of job ads

A study on the skills required by companies for Data Analysts (at least from what they say in their job ads) - based in 20K job ads scraped from Linkedin.

Some preliminary results:

## Goals

Obtain large pool of job ad descriptions found on Linkedin to answer a few burning questions for me and fellow Data Analysts:
 - What are the skills most in-demand (R, SQL, Python, etc.)?  
 - How about salary? ðŸ’²ðŸ’²ðŸ’² What's the distribution of salaries a Data Analyst can expect for a remote job?  
 - Is there any difference on the skills asked for a job in the US x Europe?  
 - How about those good old cliches that you hate to find on a job ad and that makes you wanna cringe?  
"We look for a *detail-oriented* *multi-tasker* who can work *under pressure* on a *fast-paced environment*"
