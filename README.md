# Collecting data on Linkedin Job ads

## Goals
Obtain large pool of job ad descriptions found on Linkedin (and maybe other websites) to later analyze and determine which characteristics are the most requested for a Data Analyst all over the world
Also:
-Are the requisites different for in-person or remote jobs? 
-How many job ads mention R, SQL, Python, etc.
-How about salary? Can a Data Analyst expect a higher salary based on their skillset?

## Roadmap

- [ ] Set up a somewhat GitHub-hosted automated version of the data collection pipeline
- [ ] Establish data analysis process
- [ ] Expand keywords to roles such as "Product Analyst", "Analytics Engineer", and others
- [ ] Train a few ML models to predict salary based on skills, requisites and other characteristics of the job
