3+ years' experience as a data analyst or technical business analyst that is data savvy

Experience analyzing Direct to Consumer data

Experience creating use cases

Ability to create SQL queries from scratch to pull data from multiple sources

Familiar with any type of cloud (Snowflake preferred)

Plusses

Past experience working on Streaming Services

Experience creating dashboards in Tableau

Day to day:

Insight global is looking for a Technical Business Analyst to sit in LA for a large media company. This company is ramping up their direct-to-consumer organization and needs more help with various projects. This person will be joining the Business Intelligence and Engineering team for the company's DTC (direct-to-consumer) streaming platform. The Technical Business Analyst will work alongside Sr. Data Architects, Data Engineers and Reporting Analysts who will be doing the heavy lifting in the data. This analyst will need strong communication experience as they will be presenting weekly reports to stakeholders.

A day-to-day percentage breakdown is as followed:

90% pulling data using SQL queries made from scratch
10% gathering requirements from stakeholders (data engineering team and marketing team_

An example of a requirement this analyst may receive from the business is a Marketing or product revenue use case on creating a user graph. The Marketing team would request the analyst to run a campaign for all the users between 2 different systems (ex: user A exists in NBC and user 1 exists in Peacock) Marketing team wants to know if user A and user 1 are the same? The analyst would need to understand all the identifiers such as what shows they watch, where they are located, how long they're watching the show for, etc. in order for them to pull the applicable data. Based on this analysis, the analyst will decide why users from Peacock are not users of NBC's platforms and vice versa. For example, a new advertising campaign from Peacock pulled users from Netflix or Hulu instead of an NBC platform.

DEI Statement




Cybersecurity is a community effort. That’s why we’re committed to building an inclusive, diverse community that celebrates and welcomes everyone – unless they’re a cybercriminal, of course.

We consider everyone equally: your race, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, marital status, nationality, or any other protected characteristic won’t affect your application.

Why Mimecast?




We’re fast thinking. We go big to reach our cyberattack-disrupting goals. And we do what we need to protect the world of business from getting important (and potentially compromising) data stolen. We never leave anyone behind. We deliver quickly – and outstandingly. We’re big on honesty because it makes us better. We’re empowered by our mission. And if cybercriminals have a good day, we work twice as hard to make the rest of their days a nightmare. That’s The Mimecast Way.




And the Mimecast way is also a hybrid-working way. We empower our people to balance their time between home and the office in a way that works best for them, their team, and our stakeholders.




Become a Mimecaster and put corporate data under your protection. Fill our teams with respect. And bring cybercrime-obstructing energy to your work. Be passionate. Be powerful. Be alive with purpose.




DEI Statement




Cybersecurity is a community effort. That’s why we’re committed to building an inclusive, diverse community that celebrates and welcomes everyone – unless they’re a cybercriminal, of course.




We’re proud to be an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Employer, and we’d encourage you to join us whatever your background. We particularly welcome applicants from traditionally underrepresented groups.




We consider everyone equally: your race, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, marital status, nationality, or any other protected characteristic won’t affect your application.




Due to certain obligations to our customers, an offer of employment will be subject to your successful completion of applicable background checks, conducted in accordance with local law.

For this role, we're looking for someone who enjoys designing, writing, and supporting Open Source libraries and standalone tools for developers and administrators using MongoDB. You will have the opportunity to be surrounded by veteran Java programmers, as you deepen your knowledge of the Java ecosystem, or advance your career as a writer and speaker.

Have 4+ years of experience writing high-quality software
Experience implementing libraries or applications in Java or other languages that run on the JVM
Are fascinated by, and have experience working with concurrency, parallelism and distributed systems
Want to participate in Open Source software development and communities

Are excited by our mission and values


You'll be on the team responsible for

Java driver, Java Reactive Streams Driver, Scala Driver, Spark Connector, Kafka Connector, and other JVM-based projects

Working with our Product, Server and Cloud teams on designs and specifications for new customer-facing MongoDB features
Investigating bugs and support requests from commercial and Open Source customers for the libraries and tools our team maintains
Seeking out speaking or writing opportunities to engage with our developer community
Mentoring junior engineers in both technical and non-technical professional skills


Success in this role means

Within three months, you'll know most of the codebase you are responsible for, and will be contributing effectively day-to-day, fixing bugs, and implementing already-planned features.
Within six months, you will contribute to the roadmap for our products and lead the design and specification of new features. You will have the trust of the team and our internal customers.
Within a year, you will have significantly improved the quality, performance and maintainability of our codebase, and will be taking the lead in designing new features to solve novel customer challenges

In 1951 SF Fire Credit Union first opened its doors from a modest 10′ × 15′ office space in 17 Engine. It was from those humble beginnings—where everyone pitched in to help one another in their community—that the organization forged its way of business forever. Today, the San Francisco-based credit union has grown to $1.7B in assets and a membership that extends from the regional firefighters we trace our roots back to throughout our many neighbors in San Francisco, San Mateo, and Marin Counties. Our members benefit from the ideas and principles that have shaped us: Shared trust, continuous innovation of products and services, competitive rates, and excellent member service. These qualities foster a true sense of member-ownership and strengthen the credit union’s bond with the people for whom this credit union was created.




What We Stand For…




There are a few things we look for those we hire at SF Fire Credit Union, regardless of role or team.




First, do they align with our values?




We win together.

Second, will they thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and desire to innovate? Finally, do they share our vision to help empower members to accomplish their dreams and build lasting financial security in whatever way is most relevant to their role?




What It Feels Like…




Most days it feels more like going to work with a big family. Whether it’s a potluck lunch, baking birthday cakes for colleagues in the kitchen, or after-hours get-together, we’re here to do a great job and have a good time while doing it! We value a good sense of humor, are motivated by a higher purpose, and always bring an “in-this-together” attitude. While we’re driven to do great work, we also value real work/life balance.
