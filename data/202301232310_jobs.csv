3+ years' experience as a data analyst or technical business analyst that is data savvy

Experience analyzing Direct to Consumer data

Experience creating use cases

Ability to create SQL queries from scratch to pull data from multiple sources

Familiar with any type of cloud (Snowflake preferred)

Plusses

Past experience working on Streaming Services

Experience creating dashboards in Tableau

Day to day:

Insight global is looking for a Technical Business Analyst to sit in LA for a large media company. This company is ramping up their direct-to-consumer organization and needs more help with various projects. This person will be joining the Business Intelligence and Engineering team for the company's DTC (direct-to-consumer) streaming platform. The Technical Business Analyst will work alongside Sr. Data Architects, Data Engineers and Reporting Analysts who will be doing the heavy lifting in the data. This analyst will need strong communication experience as they will be presenting weekly reports to stakeholders.

A day-to-day percentage breakdown is as followed:

90% pulling data using SQL queries made from scratch
10% gathering requirements from stakeholders (data engineering team and marketing team_

An example of a requirement this analyst may receive from the business is a Marketing or product revenue use case on creating a user graph. The Marketing team would request the analyst to run a campaign for all the users between 2 different systems (ex: user A exists in NBC and user 1 exists in Peacock) Marketing team wants to know if user A and user 1 are the same? The analyst would need to understand all the identifiers such as what shows they watch, where they are located, how long they're watching the show for, etc. in order for them to pull the applicable data. Based on this analysis, the analyst will decide why users from Peacock are not users of NBC's platforms and vice versa. For example, a new advertising campaign from Peacock pulled users from Netflix or Hulu instead of an NBC platform.

DEI Statement




Cybersecurity is a community effort. That’s why we’re committed to building an inclusive, diverse community that celebrates and welcomes everyone – unless they’re a cybercriminal, of course.

We consider everyone equally: your race, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, marital status, nationality, or any other protected characteristic won’t affect your application.

Why Mimecast?




We’re fast thinking. We go big to reach our cyberattack-disrupting goals. And we do what we need to protect the world of business from getting important (and potentially compromising) data stolen. We never leave anyone behind. We deliver quickly – and outstandingly. We’re big on honesty because it makes us better. We’re empowered by our mission. And if cybercriminals have a good day, we work twice as hard to make the rest of their days a nightmare. That’s The Mimecast Way.




And the Mimecast way is also a hybrid-working way. We empower our people to balance their time between home and the office in a way that works best for them, their team, and our stakeholders.




Become a Mimecaster and put corporate data under your protection. Fill our teams with respect. And bring cybercrime-obstructing energy to your work. Be passionate. Be powerful. Be alive with purpose.




DEI Statement




Cybersecurity is a community effort. That’s why we’re committed to building an inclusive, diverse community that celebrates and welcomes everyone – unless they’re a cybercriminal, of course.




We’re proud to be an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Employer, and we’d encourage you to join us whatever your background. We particularly welcome applicants from traditionally underrepresented groups.




We consider everyone equally: your race, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, marital status, nationality, or any other protected characteristic won’t affect your application.




Due to certain obligations to our customers, an offer of employment will be subject to your successful completion of applicable background checks, conducted in accordance with local law.

For this role, we're looking for someone who enjoys designing, writing, and supporting Open Source libraries and standalone tools for developers and administrators using MongoDB. You will have the opportunity to be surrounded by veteran Java programmers, as you deepen your knowledge of the Java ecosystem, or advance your career as a writer and speaker.

Have 4+ years of experience writing high-quality software
Experience implementing libraries or applications in Java or other languages that run on the JVM
Are fascinated by, and have experience working with concurrency, parallelism and distributed systems
Want to participate in Open Source software development and communities

Are excited by our mission and values


You'll be on the team responsible for

Java driver, Java Reactive Streams Driver, Scala Driver, Spark Connector, Kafka Connector, and other JVM-based projects

Working with our Product, Server and Cloud teams on designs and specifications for new customer-facing MongoDB features
Investigating bugs and support requests from commercial and Open Source customers for the libraries and tools our team maintains
Seeking out speaking or writing opportunities to engage with our developer community
Mentoring junior engineers in both technical and non-technical professional skills


Success in this role means

Within three months, you'll know most of the codebase you are responsible for, and will be contributing effectively day-to-day, fixing bugs, and implementing already-planned features.
Within six months, you will contribute to the roadmap for our products and lead the design and specification of new features. You will have the trust of the team and our internal customers.
Within a year, you will have significantly improved the quality, performance and maintainability of our codebase, and will be taking the lead in designing new features to solve novel customer challenges

In 1951 SF Fire Credit Union first opened its doors from a modest 10′ × 15′ office space in 17 Engine. It was from those humble beginnings—where everyone pitched in to help one another in their community—that the organization forged its way of business forever. Today, the San Francisco-based credit union has grown to $1.7B in assets and a membership that extends from the regional firefighters we trace our roots back to throughout our many neighbors in San Francisco, San Mateo, and Marin Counties. Our members benefit from the ideas and principles that have shaped us: Shared trust, continuous innovation of products and services, competitive rates, and excellent member service. These qualities foster a true sense of member-ownership and strengthen the credit union’s bond with the people for whom this credit union was created.




What We Stand For…




There are a few things we look for those we hire at SF Fire Credit Union, regardless of role or team.




First, do they align with our values?




We win together.

Second, will they thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and desire to innovate? Finally, do they share our vision to help empower members to accomplish their dreams and build lasting financial security in whatever way is most relevant to their role?




What It Feels Like…




Most days it feels more like going to work with a big family. Whether it’s a potluck lunch, baking birthday cakes for colleagues in the kitchen, or after-hours get-together, we’re here to do a great job and have a good time while doing it! We value a good sense of humor, are motivated by a higher purpose, and always bring an “in-this-together” attitude. While we’re driven to do great work, we also value real work/life balance.

We envision a Commonwealth in which all people enjoy optimal health. Massachusetts ranks among the healthiest of states according to comparative analyses, but we face numerous challenges, including inequities in chronic and infectious disease, substance abuse, violence, and preventable hospitalizations.




DPH coordinates programs and policies to address specific diseases and conditions and offers services to address the needs of vulnerable populations. We also develop, implement, promote, and enforce regulations and policies to ensure that the conditions under which people live are most conducive to health and enable people to make healthy choices for themselves and their families. We license health professionals, healthcare facilities, and a variety of businesses that impact public health. We operate the state laboratory and four public health hospitals. We monitor health status and manage vital records including births, marriages, and deaths. We educate people about public health issues and work closely with local boards of health and community partners to identify and solve public health problems.

Our Story

We are sales, marketing, and data industry pioneers who believe that data is at the heart of great business strategies. But, over the last decade, very little has changed to improve how organizations acquire and manage their sales & marketing databases. Existing data list companies are not able to adequately address the needs of modern revenue leaders. We founded RevenueBase and built the first-ever Revenue Database as a Service, a one-stop solution that offers businesses more and better data that can quickly be converted into business relationships that support growth.

RevenueBase works with B2B growth organizations of all sizes—from the Fortune 500 to seed-stage startups.

While we are based in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, this position is remote/virtual. The hours are flexible (you can set your own hours according to your work/life schedule). We encourage applications from women, people of color, people with disabilities, veterans, as well as people of any background.

Cancer Computational Biology




Would you like exposure to state-of-the-art technologies in cancer care while integrating computational analytics? We have a unique opportunity to work with an interdisciplinary team bridging the Harvard Medical School, the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT in the Rheinbay and Lawrence Groups at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. We are seeking well-qualified candidates to join our team of computational biologists working at the forefront of cancer research and treatment. We use computation as a powerful microscope to study both the fundamental biology of cancer initiation and progression, as well the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients in the hospital setting.




The successful candidate will be joining a collaborative team studying somatic mutations accumulated during therapy exposure, and how patterns of such mutations can introduce vulnerabilities for drug development. Other responsibilities will include method development and analysis for state-of-the-art liquid biopsy technologies to monitor therapy response during treatment and analysis of ‘omics’ data from different cancer types.




Principal Duties




Apply existing and novel algorithms to cancer data sets, analyze data quality, critically review and analyze results, communicate results to biologists, computational biologists, software engineers and clinicians.
Work with Cancer Center researchers to understand experimental procedures and the kinds of data produced (e.g. DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, epigenetic readouts, clinical outcome annotations). Meet and discuss with clinical and experimental colleagues to identify analytical challenges and goals.
Explore novel data visualization tools, with emphasis on integrating diverse data types and extracting clinically relevant insights.
Contribute to scientific writing and creation of data figures to be included in research publications




Required Skills & Qualifications




B.A/B.S. in one of Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Biology, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or a related quantitative discipline. Masters preferred.
Independent, self-motivated drive to push research forward.
Excellent programming skills (using any of R, Matlab, Java, Python, Perl, C, etc.)
Nimble approach to programming and data analysis, with an emphasis on simple, intuitive, reasoning: quickly open unfamiliar datasets, generate simple visualizations to project the data onto our brains as usefully as possible, to stimulate hypothesis generation and the next steps of the analysis.
Comfort using Word, Excel, Powerpoint or Google Suite tools to communicate results between team members.
Ability to work together with multi-disciplinary teams comprising physicians, biologists, statisticians, and software engineers.
Strong organizational and record-keeping skills
Fluency in spoken and written English

That includes YOU.




How would you like to do it in a fun, high-performance culture that’s truly one of a kind – on a team that appreciates you for being you, helps our members retire with confidence and makes Canada better, all at the same time?




If that sounds like your thing – and you’re an exceptional Data Analyst – we’d like to hear from you.




We’re CAAT Pension Plan, and we’re growing. We innovate defined benefit (DB) pension plans. What are they? Unlike other pension plans, they specifically define the lifetime benefits our members will receive in retirement. This means that our members know exactly what they’re getting every month – for life! Because we provide that certainty, we help more Canadians retire with greater financial security and priceless peace of mind and take pressure off the social safety net at the very same time, which frees up those resources for other Canadians who really need them.




The Data Analyst’s primary focus will be data management and reporting to assist the Pension Solutions team in proactively managing relationships with external organizations and reporting on activities. The role provides additional support performing research and documenting processes as required.




The role works closely with and under the guidance of the Senior Data Analyst and Manager, Pension Solutions, collaborating with the team’s research analysts and co-op students in a fast-paced environment with concurrent deliverables.




We are looking for someone with the following attributes:




Relevant program in community college or university such as data management, data analytics, statistics, etc.
Attention to accuracy and detail is a must.
Proficiency in the full Microsoft Office Suite (MS 365 preferred) with excellent Excel skills.
Aptitude in resourcefulness and thinking out-of-the-box.
Previous experience working with Salesforce or other CRM tool(s), and/or Power BI would be an asset.
Pension plan, group benefits or labour relations experience would be an asset.
Ability to write and communicate clearly.




Once here you will:




Maintain, process, and analyze stakeholder data and information with high attention to detail.
Investigate CRM tool improvements and work with the appropriate teams for the tool’s development.
Work on standard methodologies, best practices, and implementing improvements to the CRM tool(s) to improve department efficiency.
Liaise with internal teams on projects, initiatives, training, and documentation.
Perform research on organizations and individuals to fill in data gaps.
Assist with research on organizations and individuals, following templates and using a range of identified data sources.
Demonstrate, support, and encourage the CAAT values of integrity, teamwork and impact.
Demonstrate, support, and encourage the pillars of our organizational culture, including respect and trust, energy and optimism, open communication, promoting growth and well-being.

UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem-solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.




UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty.




The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington. Its mission is to deliver to the world timely, relevant, and scientifically valid evidence to improve health policy and practice. IHME carries out its mission through a range of projects within different research areas including the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Future Health Scenarios; Cost Effectiveness and Efficiency; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. Our vision is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base so all people live long lives in full health.




IHME is committed to providing the evidence base necessary to help solve the world’s most important health problems. This requires creativity and innovation, which are cultivated by an inclusive, diverse, and equitable environment that respects and appreciates differences, embraces collaboration, and invites the voices of all IHME team members.




IHME has an outstanding opportunity for a Data Analyst on the Environmental, Occupational, and Dietary (EOD) Risk Factors team as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study.




The GBD is a systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time, and is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. The GBD’s aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health. This position will support dietary risk factors, such as vegetable and red meat consumption, temperature and climate, air pollution, and other risk factors on the EOD team.




The main purpose of the Data Analyst position is to provide support to key research projects through database management, data quality management, computational support to multidisciplinary research projects, data extraction and formatting, and providing key inputs for papers and presentations. Data Analysts must develop an understanding of different research needs and analytic functions across multiple projects to best meet research needs.

This position calls for dexterity working with complex databases and the ability to assess, transform, and utilize quantitative data using multiple coding languages (R and Python). The individual must then quality control results to ensure that other team members have exactly what they need to incorporate the data and results into their own components of the analytic process, presentations, and papers. Additionally, this position will work alongside other Data Analysts on complementary projects and will require knowledge and skill sharing and collective problem solving. Overall, the Data Analyst will be a critical member of an agile, dynamic team. This position is contingent on project funding availability.
