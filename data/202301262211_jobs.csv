Met meer dan 150 winkels verspreid over heel het land en 2300 enthousiaste medewerkers, is Hubo een begrip geworden in de doe-het-zelf sector. Naast de reguliere verkoop via onze winkels, verkopen we ook via e-commerce. In het hoofdkantoor te Wommelgem werken 250 medewerkers met veel plezier en passie aan de toekomst van Hubo. Voor onze afdeling Business Intelligence op de hoofdzetel van Hubo te Wommelgem zijn we wegens groei op zoek naar een Data Analyst.




Wat ga je doen?

Data wordt in de toekomst steeds belangrijker, en is ook voor Hubo van onschatbare waarde! Je bent samen met je team verantwoordelijk voor de opvolging, oplevering en analyse van al ons cijfermateriaal.




Als Data Analyst ben jij het commerciële aanspreekpunt binnen het team. Je kent het datawarehouse systeem van binnen en van buiten, weet welke data we hebben en wat niet, en hoe deze ingezet moet worden in onze business.




Verschillende stakeholders uit de organisatie komen bij jou terecht met al hun vragen. Je leeft je zonder problemen in hun leefwereld in en maakt gerichte suggesties ter ondersteuning en optimalisering van hun job. Hebben we de data nog niet ontsloten, dan ga jij binnen de operationele systemen op zoek naar die verborgen parels die een wereld van verschil maken voor jouw gebruiker.




Door regelmatig zowel informeel als formeel in overleg te gaan met je key stakeholders, pols je actief naar de business noden.




Je bent daarnaast een kei in visualisatie en story telling. Jouw verhaal begeleidt onze data consumers naar de juiste beslissing.




Kriebelt het bovendien om zelf al aan de slag te gaan en een nieuwe data pipeline op te zetten maar las je dit niet in de vacature? Geen probleem bij Hubo! Als je wil, ga je zelf aan de slag met deze data en ben je ook de Data Engineer voor bepaalde projecten waarbij je, in samenspraak met je collega’s, de integratie bepaalt in het Enterprise Data Model. Je rapporteert aan het afdelingshoofd BI.




Wat vinden wij belangrijk?

Ervaring - Je beschikt over een Masterdiploma in een economische of IT richting. Daarnaast heb je enkele jaren professionele ervaring binnen Business Analyse en/of Business Intelligence. Je hebt een klare kijk op de business waardoor je een goede inschatting kunt maken van hun noden.
Expert - Dashboarding en reporting behoren tot je skill sets maar ook een goede ouderwetse Excel file weet je te appreciëren en te ontwikkelen.
Talen – Je hebt een zeer goede kennis van het Nederlands (mondeling en schriftelijk). Kennis van het Frans is een sterke plus.
Persoonlijkheid - Processen zijn jouw 2de natuur en ze analyseren en optimaliseren is jouw drive. Heb je bovendien ook nog eens fantastische project management skills dan zijn we helemaal weg van jou!
Communicatie - Communicatief sta je sterk in je schoenen en je begrijpt de commerciële noden.
Cultuur - Samen staan we sterker, dus we verwachten van jou de nodige teamspirit. Je voelt je goed binnen de DIY-sector, zelf ben je echt een ‘Doener’.




Wat bieden we je aan?

Als Belgische werkgever die aan de top staat van de DIY-sector, bieden we jou een boeiende werkomgeving. We zijn een financieel gezonde organisatie, in volle expansie met een no-nonsens cultuur waar teamwerk, persoonlijke groei en ontwikkeling centraal staan.

We investeren in jou door o.a. een uitgebreid pakket aan opleidingen aan te bieden. Je krijgt de kans om mee te werken aan de groei en uitbouw van het bedrijf.

Naast een marktconform salaris bieden wij je een interessant pakket extralegale voordelen aan met een flexibele werk- en vakantieregeling, leuke extra’s waaronder ons Employee Assistance Programma, een personeelsvoordeel in de Hubo-winkel en mogelijkheid tot thuiswerk.

Werk je bovendien graag mee aan de meest innovatieve data oplossingen van de toekomst? Laten we dan eens sparren over een positie als Power BI Data Analyst in ons Data Solutions team.

In je rol als PowerBI Data Analyst werk je nauw samen met ervaren collega’s aan Business Intelligence, Big Data en AI-projecten.
Aan de hand van je analytisch inzicht help je mee aan de transformatie van ruwe data tot inzichtelijke informatie door gebruiksvriendelijke Power BI dashboards te ontwikkelen.
Je analyseert de noden van de klant en vormt de brug tussen business users en data engineers.
Je voorziet de klant van nieuwe inzichten door eenvoudig te begrijpen data visualisaties uit te werken.


Wat breng jij mee?

Je hebt een aanstekelijk enthousiasme over data & business intelligence.
Je hebt enkele jaren ervaring opgebouwd als Data Analyst en Power BI kent voor jou geen geheimen meer.
Kennis van technologie in data engineering en datawarehouses is een plus. Ook kennis van programmeertalen zoals Python is een meerwaarde.
Je bouwt impactvolle dashboards als geen ander én je haalt energie uit storytelling.
Je brengt een flexibele, zelfstandige en collegiale houding met je mee.
Goede communicatieve vaardigheden, klantgerichtheid en nauwkeurigheid zijn tevens zeer belangrijk in deze rol.
Een bepaalde flexibiliteit naar verplaatsingen is vereist aangezien er regelmatig van bij de klant wordt gewerkt. Als je aanwezigheid bij de klant niet vereist is dan kan je in het Cegeka-kantoor dichtst bij je woonplaats werken (Antwerpen, Gent, Hasselt of Leuven) of van thuis uit.


Wat hebben wij jou te bieden?

We vragen heel wat (talenten) van jou. Gelukkig krijg je er ook heel wat voor terug! Een krak zoals jij verdient immers het allerbeste!
Competenties en karakter zijn voor ons essentieel, naast ervaring en ambities. Cegeka investeert voortdurend in talent management opdat elke medewerker zijn potentieel kan realiseren.
Innovatie en kennisdeling staan bij ons hoog op de agenda. We zijn altijd op zoek naar vernieuwing en verbetering bij onze klanten. Je krijgt volop kansen om hierin actief deel te nemen.
Je komt terecht in een hecht, gedreven en gepassioneerd team waarin het aangenaam én leuk werken is. We hebben zelfs een eigen Data Solutions fun team.
Begeleiding op maat! Jij geeft aan waar je interesses liggen. We bieden verschillende carrièrepaden aan, en kijken samen hoe we je verder kunnen helpen ontplooien.
Naast het competitief brutosalaris, een (elektrische) bedrijfswagen of mobiliteitsbudget, maaltijdcheques, ecocheques groeps-en hospitalisatieverzekering, gsm-abonnement, forfaitaire onkostenvergoeding en krachtige laptop, bieden we jou flexibele werkuren en een mooie work/life balans.
Dankzij ons Flex Reward Plan kunnen we een verloning op maat aanbieden.

Geef je carrière vleugels!




Als luchthavenbeheerder zit Brussels Airport Company aan de stuurknuppel van de grootste luchthaven in België, in het hart van Europa: Brussels Airport.




Het voorbije jaar kende de vlucht van Brussels Airport flink wat turbulentie, maar nu zitten we weer op koers. Wij geloven in een mooie, duurzame toekomst voor onze luchthaven en hebben de ambitie om van Brussels Airport de beste luchthaven in Europa te maken. Zin om aan boord te komen en de luchthaven van morgen mee vorm te geven?




Jouw bestemming?




Om ons departement Digital & Experience te versterken, zijn we voor het Digital & Data Analytics departement op zoek naar een Analytics Translator (M/V/X).




Voel je je comfortabel bij het uitvoeren van demand voor alsmaar meer vooruitstrevende businesses? Ben jij een natuurlijke koortdanser op het snijvlak van business en data?

Word jij enthousiast van het starten van een nieuw dataproject in samenwerking met het data science en engineering team? Ben je gepassioneerd om producten in productie te brengen en inzichten te creëren in data? Dan willen wij jou!




Als Analytics Translator (AT) is het jouw taak om de ""So what?"" kwestie van AI en data uit te klaren. Om dit te doen, spreekt een AT meerdere talen: business, data en tech. Afstemming van deze drie elementen is vereist om ervoor te zorgen dat dataprojecten echte, tijdige en mensgerichte voordelen opleveren. Ben jij er klaar voor om dit te realiseren?

Dit betekent dat je datastrategieën uitwerkt, use cases onderzoekt met belanghebbenden, experimenten ontwerpt en uitvoert om de waarde van een model te bewijzen, de verantwoordelijke kant van data en AI beoordeelt en implementeert alsook complexe dataproducten levert samen met onze squads van dataengineers en data scientists . Analytics Translators doen hun werk door verschillende rollen in projecten te vervullen, zoals strategisch data-adviseur, data-project / productmanager, data-ethicus en data-evangelist.

From the beginning, Starbucks set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee and its rich tradition, but that also brought a feeling of connection. We are known for developing and supporting partners who share this passion and are guided by their service to others.

As a Starbucks communications data analyst focusing on data insights, governance and reporting, you will be responsible for supporting partner (employee) digital platforms, reviewing content and overall platform performance, providing data-driven recommendations to our communications and content teams, and generating insights to share with the organization.

A systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time, the GBD is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. The GBD’s aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health. The Surge Team supports research teams through temporary assignments to help meet deadlines, manage unexpected challenges or changes in scope, and fill in where staffing has fallen short.




The main purpose of the Data Analyst position is to provide support to the GBD Tobacco team’s research projects through database management, data quality management, computational support to multidisciplinary research projects, data extraction and formatting, and providing key inputs for papers and presentations. Data Analysts must develop an understanding of different research needs and analytic functions across multiple projects to best meet research needs. Data Analysts must be able to independently translate requests into actionable results through interactions with research databases, formulation of displays of results, and development of complex code to be applied to a variety of quantitative data.




This position calls for dexterity working with complex databases and the ability to assess, transform, and utilize quantitative data using multiple coding languages (R, Python, SQL, Stata). The individual must then quality control results to ensure that other team members have exactly what they need to incorporate the data and results into their own components of the analytic process, presentations, and papers. Additionally, this position will work alongside other Data Analysts on complementary projects and will require knowledge and skill sharing and collective problem solving. Overall, the Data Analyst will be a critical member of an agile, dynamic team. This position is contingent on project funding availability.

Calculating the effect of paid marketing on our organic acquisition
“What if” incrementality analysis to quantify the impact of our discounting strategies
Collaborating with acquisition managers to setup and measure effective creative testing across paid social channels, like Facebook or TikTok


What we’re looking for in a Data Analyst:

3+ years (or equivalent) of experience in an analytics / data science role
Knowledge of SQL and Excel, and BI platforms such as Tableau
Familiarity with digital marketing concepts such as attribution, and relevant marketing metrics and KPIs
Familiarity with marketing platforms such as Google Analytics, Google Ads and Adjust
Tag/event/conversion management across marketing platforms a plus
Ability to interpret complex data sets and come up with, and communicate, actionable recommendations
Comfortable working in a fast paced start-up environment
A strong degree in a STEM subject, marketing, business or other related discipline


At Busuu we want to ensure that you have access to some great benefits:

Our centrally located offices are well-equipped with free breakfast, plenty of snacks, fresh fruit, and free dinner of your choice if you need to stay late
Busuu offers a great Private Health Insurance scheme
There is a personal training budget just for you, so you can learn more in your field to ensure our employees can continuously grow and progress in their careers
We like to support our teams with their work-life balance so we offer flexible working hours and a hybrid model of working
We offer enhanced maternity and paternity leave
Staying connected as a team is very important to us, so we have lots of social activities for you to join such a team lunches, socials, quarterly team, and company events


What Happens Next

We aim to have a simple and speedy hiring process and we want to make sure that we are right for you as much as the other way around.

CV application review - We will review it as quickly as possible and update on the next steps
Let’s chat - Quick chat with our recruiter about your experience and the role
Exercise - 1 hour exercise with the hiring manager to evaluate your data skills and marketing know-how
Meet the team - meetings with the wider team in our Madrid office


Our platform is for everyone, and so is our workplace. We pride ourselves on embracing our differences, whether they're cultural, racial, religious or otherwise. This means each one of us comes to work knowing that we have a voice – and a safe, judgement-free zone to speak freely.

If you like the sound of that, join us. We'd love to hear what you have to say.

As a company of rational thinkers with big visions, our decisions—from the smallest app feature choices all the way up to the most dramatic strategic resolutions—must rest on robust foundations of truth. To make this happen, we’re looking for a brilliant, business-driven number-cruncher, savvy enough to run SQL queries and code their way around large amounts of data—someone who’s completely obsessed with data and finding (often counterintuitive) answers to complex, crucial questions.




A few examples of your responsibilities

Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.




What we look for

Logical-analytical abilities. You’re a quick learner who’s able to investigate and effectively pick up new concepts on your own. You can solve unforeseen challenges with creativity and structure, and can do so independently.
Relevant knowledge. You don’t need to be a walking encyclopedia on the topic, but you do need to know your ABCs from your XYZs. A solid and ever-expanding knowledge base is a prerequisite—you spend a hearty portion of your time seeking to fill in the gaps in your understanding.
Organization and structure. You’re meticulously organized and superbly structured, so you can handle multiple tasks and responsibilities with poise and precision.
Pragmatism. Far from being too academic or obsessive in your perfectionism, you understand that speed is often as important as quality when getting things done in a competitive world.
Curiosity and initiative. You love exploring, and are forever hunting down new opportunities and testing fresh ideas. Rather than waiting to be told what to do, you go seek.
Passion. You love what you do, and your enthusiasm never wavers with the specifics of a given task or team. Whether you’re on a plane, train, or sofa, odds are that you’ll be found with your nose in a book or article on the subject.
Drive. You’re energetic and hard-working, and you persevere through adversity until the job is done—and done impeccably. You’re massively into getting results, and always aim for excellence in what you do.
Communication skills. You can pose questions with clarity and explain your reasoning concisely.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.




What we offer

Lots. Of. Data. With millions of users, hundreds of thousands of new users every day, and a large, diverse, and ever-growing portfolio of products, Bending Spoons is the perfect playground for a data nerd (we know you are—we are too!).
The finest tools. You get the best hardware on the market and all the software you could need. We can't wait to introduce you to our high-tech approach and our cutting-edge workflows.
Talented, knowledgeable colleagues. Learn from (and teach) some of the brightest and most skilled people you’ll ever meet. Your talent is going to blossom here.
Make a difference. Be the owner of your effort—from day one, you’re one of the team and fully trusted to take responsibility for your tasks. You’ll have every incentive to make a major impact.
Unique career opportunity. By joining a fast-growing company on a mission to become one of the world's greatest, it’s an unparalleled opportunity to turbocharge your learning and career prospects.
Continuous education. Spooners get unlimited backing for learning investments, including Italian or English lessons and things like courses, conferences, and books. There’s no permission or approval process—you’re fully trusted to use the company’s resources efficiently.
Flexible schedule. Our regular hours are 9-6 GMT+1, but this isn’t a “clock in, clock out” company. You’re fully trusted to create the right conditions for your own personal peak productivity. We only ask that you’re available to your teammates a good chunk of the day (six hours or so). That’s why it’s generally best to be based somewhere with a similar time zone—between GMT-2 and GMT+3.
Unlimited time off. Take all the time you need to be with your family or just recharge your batteries. There’s no maximum number of days off, and there isn't any kind of permission process. We just ask that you make your vacation decisions mindfully.
Remote working. Spend as much or as little time in our Milan office as you choose. Many Spooners like to change up their environment and get out of the city whenever the mood strikes. You’ve always got the freedom to decide where today’s office is.
Competitive salary and stock options. Our compensation package is highly competitive, and can grow rapidly and include stock options, depending on your performance and seniority.




Commitment & contract

Full time or part-time. Permanent or fixed-term (depending on seniority).




Location

Milan, Italy or fully remote.

If you choose the on-site option, it’s also fine to sometimes work remotely. We offer substantial support for relocation, including finding an apartment in Milan and paying the rent for 12 weeks.




The selection process

If you successfully pass through our screening process, we’ll invite you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach and solve unfamiliar problems. These tests don’t require any prior knowledge, and they should take a few hours to complete. If you’re successful there, we’ll invite you to take part in some interviews—normally two or three—to get to know each other and figure out if it’s a good fit for both parties. The interviews are held remotely, and include some behavioral and problem-solving questions. To limit human bias, all of our hiring decisions are made by a hiring committee rather than any individual.




Spooners come from all over the world and English is our working language. We welcome applications in English or Italian—whichever suits you best!




All interviews and assessments take place in English and are held online.




Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment all applicants, regardless of their race, religion, color, ancestry, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, pregnancy, political affiliation, disability, and any other legally protected characteristic.

Who We Are

GWI was founded with the knowledge that understanding your audience is really important for business. When you know who you’re speaking to and why, you can create content and campaigns that stand out to the people that matter.

Through our global online survey, we gather data on the behaviour and perceptions of consumers across the world. This provides businesses with deep, actionable insights on their audience, revealed from data they trust.

It’s been going well, too. Since launching in 2009, we’ve become one of the UK’s fastest growing target audience companies. We’re not about to stop growing any time soon. As a business, we’re on a mission to re-engineer data-driven marketing, and we’re on the lookout for talented people to join us.

Diversity & Inclusion

Imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. We’d get a very nuanced view of the world. And we definitely wouldn’t have got off the ground as a business.

Although things certainly aren’t perfect, we live in a society where differences are increasingly celebrated – so we’d expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, it’s really important to us that it stays that way. This is a place to feel at home, express yourself freely and make your mark.

Position Summary

We are looking for a Data Analyst to join CooperSurgical and help build Embryo Options, the first business of its kind to help guide patients through the process of storing cryopreserved embryos, eggs, and sperm. Embryo Options partners with IVF centers to educate and assist fertility patients with making disposition decisions for their cryopreserved tissue. The IVF center and Embryo Options partnership enables patients to conveniently pay storage fees online, as well as gain access to comprehensive educational content and the world's largest embryo donation platform.

As more and more patients are freezing embryos, eggs, and sperm, our goal is to provide tools to fertility clinics that help their patients to navigate the complicated financial, legal, and ethical issues associated with cryopreservation.

As a Data Analyst on the Embryo Options team, you will work closely with patient data to help IVF centers take advantage of the Embryo Options platform and better understand their patients and their business. Besides helping clinics, you will also develop and visualize insights for the Embryo Options product team that will drive critical business decisions.

You Will

Clean, analyze, and transform clinic cryo-storage data from disparate, unstructured sources like Excel, Microsoft Access, SQL databases, and CSV
Develop reproducible reports and workbooks to help launch new IVF centers on Embryo Options and keep their data accurate and up-to-date
Work closely with our Center Support team to communicate any data issues back to IVF clinics and EMR providers
Provide clear, reproducible analysis to help answer business questions for IVF centers and our product team
Develop intuitive, insightful data visualizations
Collaborate with our product team to identify new application features that help IVF centers better understand their patient data

You Have

2+ years of experience in a Data Analyst role
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, MIS, or a related technical field
Advanced proficiency in SQL
Experience with Excel as well as a programming language like Python or R
Experience designing data visualizations and dashboards using business intelligence tools (Tableau, Looker, Mode, Metabase, etc.)
High attention to detail, including experience with data validation techniques
Precise and effective communication skills for technical and non-technical audiences
Ability to understand the underlying needs of the business and drive impact in a fast-paced, ambiguous environment

Our Story

We are sales, marketing, and data industry pioneers who believe that data is at the heart of great business strategies. But, over the last decade, very little has changed to improve how organizations acquire and manage their sales & marketing databases. Existing data list companies are not able to adequately address the needs of modern revenue leaders. We founded RevenueBase and built the first-ever Revenue Database as a Service, a one-stop solution that offers businesses more and better data that can quickly be converted into business relationships that support growth.

RevenueBase works with B2B growth organizations of all sizes—from the Fortune 500 to seed-stage startups.

While we are based in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, this position is remote/virtual. The hours are flexible (you can set your own hours according to your work/life schedule). We encourage applications from women, people of color, people with disabilities, veterans, as well as people of any background.

Cancer Computational Biology




Would you like exposure to state-of-the-art technologies in cancer care while integrating computational analytics? We have a unique opportunity to work with an interdisciplinary team bridging the Harvard Medical School, the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT in the Rheinbay and Lawrence Groups at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. We are seeking well-qualified candidates to join our team of computational biologists working at the forefront of cancer research and treatment. We use computation as a powerful microscope to study both the fundamental biology of cancer initiation and progression, as well the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients in the hospital setting.




The successful candidate will be joining a collaborative team studying somatic mutations accumulated during therapy exposure, and how patterns of such mutations can introduce vulnerabilities for drug development. Other responsibilities will include method development and analysis for state-of-the-art liquid biopsy technologies to monitor therapy response during treatment and analysis of ‘omics’ data from different cancer types.




Principal Duties




Apply existing and novel algorithms to cancer data sets, analyze data quality, critically review and analyze results, communicate results to biologists, computational biologists, software engineers and clinicians.
Work with Cancer Center researchers to understand experimental procedures and the kinds of data produced (e.g. DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, epigenetic readouts, clinical outcome annotations). Meet and discuss with clinical and experimental colleagues to identify analytical challenges and goals.
Explore novel data visualization tools, with emphasis on integrating diverse data types and extracting clinically relevant insights.
Contribute to scientific writing and creation of data figures to be included in research publications




Required Skills & Qualifications




B.A/B.S. in one of Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Biology, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or a related quantitative discipline. Masters preferred.
Independent, self-motivated drive to push research forward.
Excellent programming skills (using any of R, Matlab, Java, Python, Perl, C, etc.)
Nimble approach to programming and data analysis, with an emphasis on simple, intuitive, reasoning: quickly open unfamiliar datasets, generate simple visualizations to project the data onto our brains as usefully as possible, to stimulate hypothesis generation and the next steps of the analysis.
Comfort using Word, Excel, Powerpoint or Google Suite tools to communicate results between team members.
Ability to work together with multi-disciplinary teams comprising physicians, biologists, statisticians, and software engineers.
Strong organizational and record-keeping skills
Fluency in spoken and written English

THE COMPANY




B-Stock is the world's largest B2B recommerce marketplace for excess [or surplus] merchandise. Businesses of all sizes leverage the B-Stock platform to sell and buy customer returns, overstock and other excess merchandise - ranging from top brands and retailers who want best-in-class inventory management to entrepreneurs looking to source valuable merchandise for their resale businesses.




Tens of thousands of small business owners all over the globe use B-Stock to launch and power their resale business. We take pride in empowering these innovators and entrepreneurs of commerce.




In 2020 we sold 120 million items across our platform, giving a second life to this otherwise would be “waste” merchandise. In fact, we kept 400 million pounds of goods in use and saved millions from the landfill. It feels good to be B-Stock!




The amount of returned or unsold inventory continues to grow each year, and in 2020, it was estimated at over $1 trillion worth worldwide. We know there is tremendous value in and demand for this inventory - no matter the category, condition, or location. The B-Stock platform gives buyers a simple way to buy brand-name merchandise directly from top retailers and manufacturers. At the same time, we offer companies an automated, trusted replacement for traditional liquidation while boosting operational efficiency, recovery rates, and cycle time.




Led by eBay veterans and backed by top investors including Spectrum Equity, True Ventures, and Susquehanna Growth Equity, B-Stock shows no signs of slowing down. Our core values have shaped the company we are today and will continue to drive our success for many years to come.

OUR VALUES




Make Each Dollar Count

Whether it’s the recovery amount or a buyer’s budget, money matters to all of our clients. And because each dollar matters to them, it matters to us.




Take Our Work Seriously, Not Ourselves

Everything at B-Stock continues to grow - everything but our egos, that is. We’re not afraid to let loose and laugh (often at ourselves).




Do The Hard Things Today That Will Pay Off Tomorrow

We’re willing to sacrifice and endure, fail and adapt to reach our long-term goals.




Use Trust As The Best Measure Of Success

The trust we earn along the way is more valuable than money. Without trust from both our buyers and sellers, our business won’t succeed.




Find Strength In Numbers

Use our passion for data to provide value to our customers, improve ourselves, and develop new ways to delight our buyers and sellers.










No applicant will face discrimination/harassment based on race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, or veteran status. Above and beyond discrimination/harassment based on “protected categories,” B-Stock also strives to prevent other, subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (e.g., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at B-Stock.

In 1951 SF Fire Credit Union first opened its doors from a modest 10′ × 15′ office space in 17 Engine. It was from those humble beginnings—where everyone pitched in to help one another in their community—that the organization forged its way of business forever. Today, the San Francisco-based credit union has grown to $1.7B in assets and a membership that extends from the regional firefighters we trace our roots back to throughout our many neighbors in San Francisco, San Mateo, and Marin Counties. Our members benefit from the ideas and principles that have shaped us: Shared trust, continuous innovation of products and services, competitive rates, and excellent member service. These qualities foster a true sense of member-ownership and strengthen the credit union’s bond with the people for whom this credit union was created.

What It Feels Like…

We value a good sense of humor, are motivated by a higher purpose, and always bring an “in-this-together” attitude. While we’re driven to do great work, we also value real work/life balance.

The analyst would need to understand all the identifiers such as what shows they watch, where they are located, how long they're watching the show for, etc in order for them to pull the applicable data.

The internet is too important to billions of people for it to be at the mercy of a few powerful companies.

Like Polkadot, Parity was built on a foundation of being decentralised and open, which trickles down to how we work. We're a distributed organisation and have been from the beginning. Being distributed isn't just a way of doing business—it's a mentality that is at the core of our culture. We have a flat structure that pushes power to the edges and empowers our people to take ownership of their role, authority coupled with responsibilities.

As the Polkadot ecosystem grows, so does the data associated with it. We are looking for a data analytics professional to perform analytics on all our marketing activities, drive the definition of metrics and implement reporting structures within the Marketing & Communications (Marcomms) department at Parity Technologies.

This is a great opportunity for someone who is passionate about marketing, Web3 and open source blockchain development to spearhead some cutting edge analytics within the Blockchain industry. Also the ability to play a pivotal role in the formation of the data platform and culture at a rapidly growing open-source technology startup.

Key Responsibilities

Lead metric definition and measurement for the department, including supporting the KPI and OKR framework and processes
Work directly with a variety of stakeholders and multiple data sets to derive sophisticated data solutions and dashboards
Create and maintain dashboards to visualize the performance (ROI, attribution etc) of different marketing activities (social media, paid advertising, website traffic, CRM, organic content etc.)
Support the mapping of existing business processes into reporting structures.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on marketing data and open-source blockchain development data within and outside the ecosystem.
Coordinate with the data engineering team to turn the results of this EDA into user-friendly, consumable and automated dashboards.
Coordinate with other departments within Parity to help ensure organizational-wide visibility of Ecosystem Development data.


Qualification and Skills

3+ years of work experience in data analytics.
Strong proficiency in Python,SQL and dashboarding tools.
Experience defining metrics, implementing reporting structures, building and automating dashboards.
Professional experience with marketing data (paid ads, website traffic, CRM etc.) workflows and activities
Knowledge and practical application of statistical techniques in a professional setting.
Familiarity with connecting and harnessing data from a number of different sources.
Ability to work autonomously, be proactive, prioritise, communicate, and function in a small team.
Strong program management skills and able to address multiple projects in parallel managing competing interests and aligning various parties on a common goal.
Ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.


Nice-to-haves

Understanding of blockchain technologies and ecosystems.
Experience with GCP.
Knowledge of GDPR.


Benefits

Working at Parity means focusing on the stuff that counts: building the most cutting-edge technology for the future web. Our teams enjoy a high degree of trust, freedom and autonomy to achieve that goal.
You will gain a keen understanding of blockchain technology and business development and have a skill set transferable to many jobs.
Because we value initiative and learning, we've defined a generous personal budget to attend conferences or skills courses of your choosing. We think you know what's best for you!
Parity is a diverse company with people from various countries, and we will support you with German or English language courses where needed.
Not all of us who collaborate work in the same place. Bringing the team together is something we value a lot, so we regularly go on team retreats.

Blacklane is a scale-up started in 2011, founded by Jens Wohltorf and Frank Steuer who wanted to create the first global chauffeur service.

Backed by Daimler and other investors in Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the UAE, we're now a trusted brand within corporate travel.

We believe in ethical business practices and have a strong company culture. Responding to the pandemic, we've successfully managed the crises and retained our talented crew!

We search, find and coordinate service capacities so that hospitals can focus on their patients rather than processes.

Within a very short time, Recare was able to onboard over 750 acute care and rehabilitation clinics as well as over 14 000 other service providers on its platform. Renowned hospitals and hospital groups such as Vivantes, Sana Kliniken AG, München Klinik, Hannover Medical School, and Essen University Hospital are among Recare's customers, as well as major health insurances such as TK, BKK and Barmer.

Example product use case - Rehabilitation

When a patient needs to be transferred to a rehabilitation clinic after a hospital stay, hospital staff currently have to:

fax (yes, fax...) forms to the patient's insurance to ask whether they are eligible for rehabilitation
find an available clinic offering the needed services (generally done by calling many and sharing patient data via fax).


With RECARE, hospital staff upload all relevant patient information in one place with the click of a button directly from the hospital’s information system, and can share it securely with all parties involved. An automated search is then started to find an available spot within our network of rehabilitation clinics.

Rehabilitation is just one of our use cases, we also cover care, transport, medical supplies and hospital transfers. Our product combines a SaaS with a marketplace to automate time-intensive tasks and free up hospital resources for patients rather than processes.

Aufgaben

Renowned hospitals and hospital groups such as Vivantes, Sana Kliniken AG, München Klinik, Hannover Medical School, and Essen University Hospital are among Recare's customers, as well as major health insurances such as TK, BKK and Barmer.<br><br><strong>Example product use case - Rehabilitation<br><br></strong>When a patient needs to be transferred to a rehabilitation clinic after a hospital stay, hospital staff currently have to:<br><ul><li>fax (yes, fax...) forms to the patient's insurance to ask whether they are eligible for rehabilitation</li><li>find an available clinic offering the needed services (generally done by calling many and sharing patient data via fax). <br><br></li></ul>With RECARE, hospital staff upload all relevant patient information in one place with the click of a button directly from the hospital’s information system, and can share it securely with all parties involved. An automated search is then started to find an available spot within our network of rehabilitation clinics.<br><br>Rehabilitation is just one of our use cases, we also cover care, transport, medical supplies and hospital transfers.
