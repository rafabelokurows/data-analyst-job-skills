That includes YOU.




How would you like to do it in a fun, high-performance culture that’s truly one of a kind – on a team that appreciates you for being you, helps our members retire with confidence and makes Canada better, all at the same time?




If that sounds like your thing – and you’re an exceptional Data Analyst – we’d like to hear from you.




We’re CAAT Pension Plan, and we’re growing. We innovate defined benefit (DB) pension plans. What are they? Unlike other pension plans, they specifically define the lifetime benefits our members will receive in retirement. This means that our members know exactly what they’re getting every month – for life! Because we provide that certainty, we help more Canadians retire with greater financial security and priceless peace of mind and take pressure off the social safety net at the very same time, which frees up those resources for other Canadians who really need them.




The Data Analyst’s primary focus will be data management and reporting to assist the Pension Solutions team in proactively managing relationships with external organizations and reporting on activities. The role provides additional support performing research and documenting processes as required.




The role works closely with and under the guidance of the Senior Data Analyst and Manager, Pension Solutions, collaborating with the team’s research analysts and co-op students in a fast-paced environment with concurrent deliverables.




We are looking for someone with the following attributes:




Relevant program in community college or university such as data management, data analytics, statistics, etc.
Attention to accuracy and detail is a must.
Proficiency in the full Microsoft Office Suite (MS 365 preferred) with excellent Excel skills.
Aptitude in resourcefulness and thinking out-of-the-box.
Previous experience working with Salesforce or other CRM tool(s), and/or Power BI would be an asset.
Pension plan, group benefits or labour relations experience would be an asset.
Ability to write and communicate clearly.




Once here you will:




Maintain, process, and analyze stakeholder data and information with high attention to detail.
Investigate CRM tool improvements and work with the appropriate teams for the tool’s development.
Work on standard methodologies, best practices, and implementing improvements to the CRM tool(s) to improve department efficiency.
Liaise with internal teams on projects, initiatives, training, and documentation.
Perform research on organizations and individuals to fill in data gaps.
Assist with research on organizations and individuals, following templates and using a range of identified data sources.
Demonstrate, support, and encourage the CAAT values of integrity, teamwork and impact.
Demonstrate, support, and encourage the pillars of our organizational culture, including respect and trust, energy and optimism, open communication, promoting growth and well-being.
Other duties as assigned.







What does CAAT offer you and what should you know about us?




Our vision is to provide an environment where employees can bring their whole, authentic selves to work. That’s what drives our high-performance, fun culture – one that’s truly one of a kind.

Solliciteren

Wat doe je precies?

Heb je een passie voor data, digitale technologie, innovatie, en het oplossen van complexe problemen? Wil jij een positieve impact hebben op de omgeving en de samenleving?

Ben je benieuwd hoe je miljoenen gebeurtenissen en datapunten kan veranderen in inzichten voor het heden, maar ook hoe deze inzichten tot impactvolle acties in de toekomst kunnen leiden? Als dit zo is, dan ben jij de geschikte kandidaat om ons team bij Data & Analytics te komen vervoegen!

Het Data & Analytics departement is verantwoordelijke voor het bepalen en implementeren van de Belfius datastrategie. Dit omvat een breed spectrum aan activiteiten (marketing, distributie, risk, regulatory, procesoptimalisatie,…). We bouwen aan end-to-end oplossingen door onze expertise in onder andere data sourcing, architectuur, governance, advanced analytics te gebruiken voor de realisatie van data hubs, dashboards, modellen, rapportering en ad-hoc analyses. De teams zijn multifunctioneel en bestaan uit analisten, data scientisten, data engineers, cockpit designers en projectmanagers.

Het ESG (environment, social & governance) programma bij Belfius bestaat uit een set van projecten over nieuwe regelgevingen, verplichte en vrijwillige publieke rapporteringen, vrijwillige engagementen en ondersteuning van ESG-productontwikkeling. De missie van het ESG data team is om deze initiatieven te ondersteunen en binnen data de ESG-strategie mee te sturen.

Taken en verantwoordelijkheden:

Gegevens analyseren met SQL, SAS en Python ;
Bouwen en beheren van ESG-rapportering en ontwikkeling van KPIs, zowel op niveau van Belfius bank als op niveau van de groep ;
Visualiseren van data en een verhaal kunnen vertellen aan de hand van de gegevens ;
Technische oplossingen zoals data interfaces en calculation engines uitwerken en implementeren in samenwerking met IT ;
Ondersteunen, verbeteren en optimaliseren van het ESG-beleid en gegevensverzameling ;
Definiëren van nieuwe ESG-concepten en deze definities vertalen naar data ;
Behoeften bespreken en challengen met verschillende stakeholders ;
Deze behoeften vertalen naar dataoplossingen (concepten, verwachte outputs, optimale inputs).

Wat mag je van ons verwachten?

Bij Belfius willen wij Meaningful & Inspiring zijn voor de Belgische samenleving en jij kan ons helpen om het verschil te maken.

Wij hechten er veel belang aan dat elke medewerker privéleven en werk goed met elkaar kan combineren. Zo is onze bedrijfscultuur in de eerste plaats gebaseerd op vertrouwen en autonomie en hebben we een hybride manier van werken ingevoerd, “Home Based” genaamd, die berust op een gezond evenwicht tussen telewerk en ‘onsite’ werken op kantoor. Als nieuwe medewerker word jij automatisch aangeworven met dit statuut. Concreet werk jij thuis gedurende het grootste deel van je werktijd, en combineer je dat telewerk met aanwezigheid op de werkplek, m.a.w. onze hoofdzetel of een regionale zetel, afhankelijk van de behoeften van de dienst en met het oog op de instandhouding van onder meer een goede samenwerking met je chef, je collega’s, je transversale contacten enz.

De hoofdzetels en de regionale zetels zijn gemakkelijk bereikbaar met het openbaar vervoer. Kom je naar kantoor werken? Begin dan je werkdag op de hoofdzetel met een trainingssessie in de Belfius Workout, de fitnessruimte made@belfius, gebruik 's middags een gezonde lunch in een van onze bedrijfsrestaurants of in The Village, waar je eveneens informele vergaderingen kan houden met collega's bij een koffie of een kleine versnapering.

Neem je loopbaan in eigen handen en maak gebruik van de mogelijkheden tot individuele ontwikkeling die je worden aangeboden door de Belfius Academy. Als werkgever investeren wij in de ontwikkeling van leadership. Voorts zijn diversiteit en gelijke kansen in onze ogen belangrijke waarden.

We bieden je bovendien een aantrekkelijk loonpakket aan dat je ten dele zelf kan samenstellen volgens je eigen behoeften, met daarbovenop tal van bovenwettelijke voordelen zoals een groepsverzekering, een hospitalisatieverzekering, maaltijdcheques, een abonnement op het openbaar vervoer, een korting op bank- en verzekeringsproducten enz.

Wat verwachten we van jou?

Je hebt minstens twee jaar ervaring in een vergelijkbare functie ;
Je bent burgerlijk ingenieur, handelsingenieur, master in de informatica of de toegepaste (economische) wetenschappen, of gelijkwaardig dankzij ervaring ;
Je hebt bent zeer sterk in analyse en synthese en je kan complexe situaties structureren ;

De complexiteit van kredieten aan zelfstandigen, KMO’s en large corporates neemt toe. Tegelijk zijn ondernemerskredieten ook een steeds belangrijkere schakel in de evolutie naar een meer duurzame wereld. Want zonder kredieten kunnen ondernemers vaak niet de investeringen doen die nodig zijn om klimaatverandering tegen te gaan. KBC is vastbesloten om daar een belangrijke rol in te spelen.




Om dat zo goed mogelijk te doen, kijken we naar jou als data-analist om antwoorden te vinden op een veelheid aan vragen. Zo kunnen we de massa aan data die we hebben concreet gebruiken, bijvoorbeeld in onze prijszetting, strategie, beleidsvorming, productbeleid en rapportering. Reken dus op veel afwisseling en uitdaging in je job.




Wat verwachten we van jou?




Wanneer een concrete vraag tot bij jou komt, ga je het gesprek aan met de business stakeholder(s) tot de vraag helemaal helder is.
Op basis van de data-vereisten bepaal je de juiste interne & externe databronnen en schrijf je de code om die data op te halen en te structureren.
Tijdens de opdracht zorg je voor een goede wisselwerking met de business stakeholders. Zo zorg je end-to-end voor een nette oplevering en krijgen de business stakeholders de inzichten die ze nodig hebben om verder te kunnen.




Jouw troeven?




Inzichten vinden in data, daar krijg je energie van. Op zoek gaan naar databronnen? Data omzetten in impactvolle rapporten? Inzichten ontdekken? Een verklaring vinden voor een afwijking? Dat zijn zaken die jij graag en goed doet.
Je hebt een masterdiploma (bijvoorbeeld in economie, wetenschappen, engineering of IT) of hebt data-analyse skills opgebouwd in een eerdere werkervaring. Ervaring met SAS, Python, SQL of QlikSense is een pluspunt.
Kennis van kredieten en ondernemen is geen must, maar het is wel belangrijk dat je er interesse in hebt. Een sterke affiniteit met de verschillende aspecten van duurzaamheid is wel een must.
Samen met je collega’s voor een doel gaan motiveert je. Je vindt het belangrijk om als team te werken met je collega’s.
Je communiceert vlot in het Nederlands en het Engels. In beide talen breng je complexe materie helder over, in gesprekken maar ook in rapporten en presentaties.




Wat hebben we je te bieden?




Bij ons ben je zeker van een uitstekende onboarding, collegialiteit en een aangename werksfeer.
Doorheen je hele loopbaan bij KBC moedigen we je aan om verder te groeien als persoon en als professional. Je kan opleidingen volgen waarin je je hard en soft skills verder aanscherpt.
Onze werkplekken zijn vlot bereikbaar met het openbaar vervoer. Je kan ook deels thuiswerken, als je dat wil.
Flexibele werkuren helpen je om je werk en je privéleven op elkaar af te stemmen.
We bieden jou een contract van onbepaalde duur en een competitief loon aangevuld met extralegale voordelen. Sounds familiar? Tuurlijk, dit lees je in elke vacature. KBC maakt het verschil met een uitgebreid flexpakket. Te uitgebreid om hier uit de doeken te doen. De verschillende voordelen - groot en klein - bespreken we graag met jou tijdens je sollicitatiegesprek.

Solliciteren

Wat doe je precies?

Bij Belfius geloven we dat data de basis vormen van onze digitale transformatie. Of het nu gaat om digitale marketing, het leveren van producten en diensten op maat, het nemen van tactische en strategische beslissingen, het verbeteren van de procedures of het monitoren van onze prestaties, data spelen in dat verband een cruciale rol.

Elke dag opnieuw vinden miljoenen verrichtingen plaats in de systemen van Belfius, wat telkens data oplevert. In het Risk/ICM Data Delivery-team moeten wij die gegevens begrijpen en ze vertalen in insights en tools ontwikkelen ter ondersteuning van de beslissingen en de strategie van de metiers.

Heb jij een passie voor datamanagement, innovatie en het oplossen van complexe problemen? Wil jij begrijpen hoe wij die data vertalen in diverse indicatoren inzake rentabiliteit en risicobeheer? Is dat het geval, dan ben jij de ideale kandidaat om te komen werken bij ons Risk/ICM Data Delivery-team!

Wat houdt de functie in?

Wij zijn op zoek naar iemand die ons kan ondersteunen in onze activiteiten inzake reporting en kwaliteitscontrole. In die functie hebt jij twee expertisedomeinen:

Producten die provisieloon opleveren (rekeningen, fondsen, beleggingen enz.);
De kosten, en dat voor alle activiteiten van de bank.

In die context krijg jij twee hoofdtaken toebedeeld. Aan de ene kant voer je analyses uit van de maandelijkse resultaten en zorg jij ervoor dat die de nodige kwaliteit hebben. Je stelt je analyses eveneens ter beschikking van de diverse stakeholders zodat zij hun beslissingen kunnen nemen. Aan de andere kant bekommer jij je eveneens om de follow-up van de evoluties in het domein (impact op de berekening van de rentabiliteit bij de lancering van nieuwe producten, het veranderen van tariefstructuur enz.) om de potentiële impact op onze activiteiten te analyseren.

In welk team kom je terecht?

Binnen de afdeling Data & Analytics maakt het Risk/ICM Data Delivery-team deel uit van Data Transformation Risk & ICM en is het verantwoordelijk voor het exploiteren van de data van het domein Risk & ICM voor het berekenen van de rentabiliteit en de positie van de risico’s van de klanten, segmenten, producten, metiers enz. Het team identificeert transversaal en gecentraliseerd de behoeften van de diverse betrokken partijen in termen van de visualisering en architectuur en is verantwoordelijk voor diverse taken:

Ontwikkeling van cockpits: visualisering van het financieel/commercieel rendement en van de positie van Risk voor de segmenten/klanten/producten;
Verslagen opstellen en bestaande verslagen automatiseren: die worden opgesteld op basis van definities afkomstig uit geharmoniseerde gegevensbronnen;
Ad-hocanalyses: bijvoorbeeld op een categorie van klanten, een bepaald product enz

De afdeling omvat multifunctionele teams met o.m. data engineers en data analysts.

De Data Analyst is in de eerste plaats een aanspreekpunt in het domein van de kosten en de provisielonen en de aanwending van de gegevens daarrond. Hij/zij is verantwoordelijk voor:

Een grondige follow-up doen van de maandelijkse resultaten aangaande de fees en de kosten in de P&L. In dat opzicht voert hij/zij analyses uit en stelt hij gestandaardiseerde verslagen op voor de stakeholders ;
Het op de voet volgen van de evoluties in zijn domein (evenementen, nieuwe producten, evoluties van de pricing enz.) en de impact ervan op zijn activiteiten en op de P&L van de bank ;
Een aanspreekpunt zijn voor onze stakeholders om hun behoeften te begrijpen, een afdoende analysebenadering uit te werken en dat toetsen aan de bestaande verslagen.
Eventueel:
De resultaten van zijn analyses op een gestructureerde en begrijpelijke wijze toelichten ;
Kwaliteitscontroles en de Data Governance Standards in zijn activiteiten omschrijven en implementeren;
Proactief verbeterpunten in zijn activiteiten identificeren ;
De visualisering van de gegevens ondersteunen. De Data Analyst speelt potentieel een belangrijke rol bij het digitaliseren van zijn gegevens in een dashboarding-tool. Er wordt verwacht dat de Data Engineer proactief verbeteringen kan voorstellen.

De Data Analyst maakt deel uit van de Data Visualisation community en bepaalt en deelt in die hoedanigheid de best practices op het gebied van datavisualisatie.

We’re looking for people with good data engineering skills, and you’ll ideally bring with you:

Proven role experience in developing ETL and data integration solutions
Good knowledge of the Azure data engineering stack - Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse, Azure Data Lake, Azure Blob, Cosmos DB

Good experience in general programming – ideally Python

You’ll have experience working with data warehouse solutions, extracting and processing data in various ways using off-the-shelf tools and open-source tools. You’ll also be really familiar with working with Linux or Windows operating systems and version control systems (Git).

We value empathy in our colleagues, and it’s important you bring a growth mindset and a willingness to learn and adapt.

At Big Industries, we have the ambition to become the number one trusted advisor in data solutions. We offer expert consulting for Architecture definition, cloud and classic Data Lake deployments and advanced Data Engineering. If you want to work with data, we’re the best place to start!




Right now, we’re looking for Data Engineers who are as passionate as we are about new technology. Thanks to our wide variety of clients and big projects, you will always be able to keep growing as a professional. And whether you’re working on a project by yourself or with another Big Industries colleague, you can always count on your teammates for support!




So, what exactly will you be doing?




You will be implementing complex and large scale data projects.
Collecting, parsing, managing, analyzing and visualizing large data sets.
Turning raw data into insights using multiple toolsets, techniques and cloud based platforms (we partner with cloud providers AWS and Microsoft Azure and ""Best of Breed"" vendors like Cloudera and Confluent).
Occasionally, you will develop and implement various statistical and machine learning models and you are in charge of controlling the performances of your models output.







What do you need to do a stellar job?




Some solid background to take on big projects. We’re thinking in terms of a degree in Computing or about 3 years of relevant experience within systems integration teams.
A thorough understanding of Java and SQL and a solid grasp of best practices in software development.
Experience using big data and related technologies (like Spark, Python, Scala, Kafka).
Willingness to become AWS or Confluent Certified Developer.
Very good knowledge of Linux Systems and shell scripting.
A positive attitude and willingness to feed our family feel, share your wisdom and help your colleagues grow (like they will do for you).




We’ll think you're extra cool if you…




Are good at coming up with memes (or posing for them).
Own a 1989 Gameboy and are willing to share it, ‘cause we’ve lost ours.




What’s in it for you?




At Big Industries, we want you to become the professional you want to be. That’s why you’ll always have your team of experienced colleagues to help you and all the tools you need to do an amazing job.




Money and stuff…

A nice salary package with extra benefits, such as home office allowance, eco vouchers,...
A car you will want to show off to your family (with Benelux fuel card).
A nice phone (of your choice) and laptop (Apple by default) to share funny memes with your colleagues.
A lunch allowance (if bullies steal it, don’t come crying to us).
A health and pension plan, to keep you happy and healthy now and when you’re in diapers!




But at least equally important:

Membership of our Big Industries Academy to keep learning any way you want.
A personalized training plan and a budget to register for the training courses you need.
Monthly check-ins to see how you’re doing (we’ll provide the tissues if it’s bad).
Regular team events to keep connected with your colleagues as well as spontaneous, informal drinks.
An awesome team that will always have your back, in person or via Slack!

We’re looking for a data engineer to help us power the data of Prezi, the virtual collaboration tool that's changing how our customers work together in the hybrid office. As part of the Prezi Engineering community, you will collaborate with other teams, mentor less-experienced engineers, and advocate for clean, maintainable, and testable code in a work environment where people from all backgrounds can thrive and grow. Your impact will help millions of people build and deliver moving stories.




Prezi is a virtual first company and has hubs in Berlin, Budapest, Riga, and San Francisco. For this position, we are looking for someone in the EU and UK time zones, so you’ll have the flexibility to work remotely. The best part: you’ll be part of an awesome team that highly appreciates visual communication, believes that together we are greater than the sum of our parts, and cares deeply about those around us. At Prezi, we celebrate the diversity of our customers and our employees. We employ people from all backgrounds to build a product for everyone. We’re looking for people who can bring in their different perspectives and help us on our mission to reinvent how people share knowledge, tell stories, and inspire audiences to act.




Data @ Prezi




We believe that data analytics should be easy for both technical and non-technical people. We aim to create the tools, build the data platform and train our users to make this possible.




To better understand our users we collect data from all parts of our product and push it to a Kafka cluster and ingest data to Amazon distributed storage S3. We then use open source tools like Apache Gobblin to further process and analyze our data. We collect around 1TB data/day. Analysts who are interested in the data can crunch the data using Zeppelin or can schedule jobs with our ETL system to process the data with Spark/Trino. Data is then exposed through Hive tables for further analyses and reporting.

Strong interpersonal and communications skills; ability to consult, partner and work effectively with business partners and technical partners across functions
Enthusiasm for DevOps: we build it, we run it!
Excitement for building on open sourced tools as well as contributing to existing products
Get it done behavior: you are smart and quick with a focus on delivery
Bravery to try, pilot and eventually productise new technologies
You might also have...




Experience with Amazon Web Services or similar cloud provider
Experience with kubernetes (k8s)

What are the Marketplace Design teams about




As the place where all real estate actors gather (home seekers, owners, intermediaries, etc…), the marketplace’s primary success factor is to provide the highest standards in terms of safety, truthfulness, relevance, efficiency and quality of the interactions between each of these actors.

Together, we want to achieve one objective: support our clients to accelerate the delivery of their drugs and improve people’s health.




For 30 years, IDDI has successfully supported 1200+ clinical trials for 330+ pharmaceutical companies and biotech companies, as well as academic cooperative groups and CROs worldwide.

Thanks to a scientifically driven culture and close collaboration with KOLs, IDDI also has a fruitful history of Research and Development projects and more than 15% of IDDI’s projects are academic studies. One of these R&D projects has led to the foundation of CluePoints, now leader in the field of data quality assessment in clinical trials.




Today, IDDI is proud to contribute to 4 significant research projects, including the BENEFIT project (Biostatistical Estimation of Net Effects for Individualization of Therapy) for which we are looking for an experienced and dynamic Statistical Analyst who will support its success!

With the Benefit project, IDDI focuses on an innovative solution dedicated to personalized medicine based on a novel statistical method called GPC (Generalized Pairwise Comparisons) – See M Buyse, Generalized pairwise comparisons of prioritized outcomes in the two-sample problem, Statistics in medicine, 2010, 29 3245–3257DOI: 10.1002/sim.3923.




While classical statistical design and analysis of clinical trials are based on a sole primary endpoint; the GPC method allows studying the combined multidimensional impact of several endpoints thereby maximizing statistical power and limiting the trial sample size. The flexibility of GPC allows involving patients and clinicians in the analysis and place patients at the center of the therapeutic decision. This is illustrated in this video:

Of heb je al een eerste werkervaring achter de rug? Ben je op zoek naar een uitdagende job als consultant? Dan is ons Young Professional development programma iets voor jou! Als Young Professional doorloop je in ons hoofdkantoor in Mechelen een intensief opleidingstraject van tien weken en word je persoonlijk begeleid. Binnen dit traject krijg je de kans om jouw opleidingsvaardigheden te vertalen naar de praktijk en word je klaargestoomd voor een eerste opdracht als consultant.

Tijdens het programma wordt er stilgestaan bij onder andere Data Modelling, Azure, Python, AWS en behaal je meteen ook je eerste certificaten. Nadien ga je meteen aan de slag met je eerste IT-consultancy opdracht bij één van onze klanten.

Als Data Engineer ben je in staat om onze klanten te helpen met het beheren van hun masterdata en het in kaart brengen van hun datastromen. Je denkt samen met de klant na over de beste implementatie van data, zodat de verschillende datateams nog beter kunnen samenwerken en de kwaliteit steeds centraal blijft staan. Ook dan sta je er niet alleen voor, je wordt er omringd door senior collega’s.

Wil je je carrière als Data engineer starten? Dan is dit de job voor jou!

Wie we zoeken


Je hebt een bachelor- of masterdiploma in IT
Je bent gefascineerd door nieuwe trends en best practices
Je lost graag complexe (data) problemen en stellingen op
Je wilt je kennis in datamodellering en dataprivacy versterken
Je wilt bijleren over monitoring en logging van data
Je hebt een sterke interesse in onder andere Azure, SQL, Python en AWS
Je werkt zorgvuldig, zelfstandig, oplossings- en resultaatgericht
Je communiceert vloeiend in het Nederlands en Engels, kennis van het Frans is een plus


Wat we bieden

Vanaf dag één van je opleiding ben je een échte Ordinees met een vast contract. Na het young professional programma krijg je het volste vertrouwen om meteen aan een boeiend, concreet project te werken. Met de nodige ondersteuning van je managers en collega’s, uiteraard. Die ondersteuning garanderen we gedurende je hele loopbaan, want Ordina hecht ontzettend veel belang aan opleiding en ontwikkeling. Voor je het weet evolueer je zo misschien naar een experten rol.

It’s not all about work! Je komt terecht in een bedrijf met een heel open, transparante cultuur dat zijn mensen – jou dus – echt centraal zet. Je leert snel bij, dankzij onze opleidingen, competence centers en je collega’s. En je ontdekt snel dat we bij Ordina ook graag wat stoom aflaten op verschillende get-togethers, onze jaarlijkse familiedag of gewoon met een Open Bar om het weekend in te zetten. Tenslotte wordt dit alles aangevuld met een aantrekkelijk salaris met extralegale voordelen zoals een bedrijfswagen, laptop, verzekeringspakket, maaltijdcheques, ecocheques, en onkostenvergoeding.

Time for the next step then. And go from curious data lover to curious data chief. In various roles at one or more companies.

What’s in it for you? A killer combo of data and people skills

Discover your data thing: Find out which part you want to play in the data universe (and at which company). By doing and learning. And with our help.
Challenging projects: Switch roles, teams, companies and industries. In advanced data analytics, processing, project management, business analytics, … The common thread: data.

A big passion for data is a big must. You don't need to be an expert in data just yet. We’ll help you become one. Just show us your affinity and above all: your passion!
Data tools are your middle name. Excel has no secrets for you, and other tools like Python, SQL or PowerBI sound familiar too. You just love to dive into all possible data tools.
You have a master or bachelor degree in a data-oriented field. Think civil or business engineering, mathematics, computer science, applied economics, statistics, IT,…
Or max 3 years work experience in analytics or a job filled with projects that triggered your passion for data, digital and tech.

Als digital analyst ondersteun je de verschillende merken van Colruyt Group bij hun digitale activiteiten: van Colruyt Laagste Prijzen tot Dreamland, van apps tot campagnes. Jij analyseert de data en zet ze om in adviezen voor de online strategie van onze merken. Een job met impact en uitdaging!




Je komt terecht in het Communication Analytics team van DnA, de centrale data-divisie van Colruyt Group. Het Digital Analytics team telt een tiental personen en bestaat uit een mix van digital analysts en developers voor datacaptatie en activatie.

Als digital analyst ondersteun je verschillende merken van Colruyt Group bij hun digitale activiteiten. Samen met je partners bij deze merken ga je op zoek naar relevante meetpunten en KPI’s die bijdragen tot het behalen van communicatiedoelstellingen. Eenmaal deze bepaald zijn, zit je samen met technische experten die ervoor zorgen dat de gevraagde meetpunten geïmplementeerd worden en dat de data richting analytics tools kan stromen.

Hierna verzamel en interpreteer je data van verschillende digitale touchpoints (sites, apps, e-mails, campagnes …) én offline data.

Zo kan je bijvoorbeeld op dezelfde dag een tagging guide bespreken met developers én een campagneanalyse met marketeers.

Je team werkt nauw samen met externe consultants. Zo kunnen we onze partners optimaal ondersteunen en bepalen we mee de richting van onze digitale touchpoints. Hiervoor verdiep je je in verschillende specialisaties die te maken hebben met de gebruikservaring op onze digitale kanalen: van digital KPI-frameworks en campagneanalyses tot A/B-testing.




Je werkt in Halle, maar kan tot drie dagen per week telewerken.







Profiel:

Ervaring – Je hebt al enkele jaren ervaring in online marketing of digital analytics. Een basis in statistiek is een must!

Attitude – Als digital analytics expert blijf je op de hoogte van de recentste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied. Continu bijleren is part of the job!
Teamplayer – Jij krijgt energie van het delen van je digital analytics kennis en werkt zo met het hele team naar mooie resultaten toe.
Problemen oplossen – Je bent analytisch en hebt een goed probleemoplossend vermogen. Daarnaast kan je goed plannen en stel je je dienstbaar op.

Je komt in een relatief klein team terecht en hebt toch met heel veel verschillende andere teams en functies contact.
Persoonlijke groei – Bij Colruyt Group kan je jezelf ontplooien, op professioneel en persoonlijk vlak dankzij een breed aanbod opleidingen.
Aantrekkelijk loonpakket – Boven op een aantrekkelijk loon krijg je extralegale voordelen zoals maaltijdcheques en winstdeelname.

Run sensitivity analysis on complex financial models and occasionally develop our own models
Draft new business proposals, credit modifications and annual reviews
Perform client and credit administration primarily through timely, complete and correct data input and data management in the relevant support systems in line with internal procedures and guidelines
Participate in client and bank calls/meetings
Side projects such as internal reporting and business development




We look for




A colleague with a talent for taking it on and making it happen, enthusiasm for helping others to be successful and a knack for always being a step ahead.




As an Analyst/Associate within the Infrastructure sector team, you will also need:




Strong academic record, with relevant master’s degree in business economics, financial engineering or law
Interest for the Infrastructure sector and/or structured finance
A true team player with good communication skills

Strong quantitative, financial and analytical skills
Strong eye for detail in all deliverables
Eager to learn and share knowledge with colleagues

We offer you




A clear purpose, a unique offer and a range of benefits:




Personal growth & challenging work with endless opportunities to realise your ambitions
Informal, dynamic environment with innovative colleagues supporting your endeavours
Experience an international environment and collaborate with colleagues across the globe
On-the-job training to translate theory into practice, learning from highly experienced professionals

BDO Advisory (Digital) verleent deskundig advies op het raakvlak tussen business en ICT. Dankzij een onderbouwde en pragmatische aanpak leveren we tastbare resultaten en groeien we op die manier uit tot een effectieve en betrouwbare partner van onze klanten.
Onze organisatie is in squads opgedeeld met verschillende technische domeinen om maximaal innovatie en autonomie te stimuleren.
Bij BDO Digital kom je terecht in een no-nonsens omgeving met veel aandacht voor innovatie, work-life balance en persoonlijke groei.


Om het Technologies team te versterken, zijn wij op zoek naar een ervaren Data Engineer.








De uitdaging


Als Data Engineer zal je deel uitmaken van het DMIII (Data Management, Integration, Insight & Intelligence) team. Een jong team met sterke focus op nieuwe technologieën en technieken (met focus op Cloud).


Je helpt klanten met het beheer van hun data en het verkrijgen van inzichten in deze gegevens. Zowel op strategisch vlak, als met het maken van de juiste technologiekeuzes en de implementatie.
Je krijgt de kans om mee de richting te bepalen en mee de strategische keuzes van het aanbod te bepalen
Je zal met verschillende tools aan de slag gaan zoals Snowflake, Matillion, PowerBI, Python, Databricks, Azure ML
Een aantal activtiteiten die kunnen behoren tot het takenpakket:
Extractie, centralisatie en modellering van data (data warehousing)
Rapportering en visualisatie van gegevens
Verdergaande analyses van datasets zoals statische analyses of het toepassen van machine learning algoritmes.
Opzetten van structuren en tools rond data governance, data kwaliteit en data privacy
Afhankelijk van jouw interesse, kan je je toespitsen op jouw voorkeur.







Het gewenste profiel


Je hebt een bachelor- of masterdiploma in IT, of je kan je skills omtrent Data Engineering duidelijk aantonen vanuit je uitgebreide ervaring.
Je beheerst vlot het Nederlands en het Engels; als je sterke skills hebt in het Frans, dan is dit zeker een plus.
Je kan mogelijke technische skills voorleggen: (of gelijkaardig):
Cloud platformen, bij voorkeur Microsoft Azure
Data modelleringstechnieken zoals Data Vault 2.0
Databases (SQL) en ETL/ELT.
Software zoals Snowflake, Matillion, PowerBI, Python
Data governance tools zoals Collibra
Ervaring als consultant is een grote plus, gezien je vaak in interactie zal zijn met klanten, waarbij de users vaak ook geen IT'ers zijn; je bent dus klantgericht en legt de nodige empathie, onderhandelingsvaardigheden en flexibiliteit aan de dag.





What's in it for you?


Binnen BDO Advisory (Digital) kom je terecht in een professionele organisatie met een pragmatische en persoonlijke aanpak. Menselijke waarden zijn belangrijk, evenals een gezonde work-life balance.


Kans om te werken bij en hoge kwaliteit neer te zetten bij klanten.
Je werkt in een hechte ploeg van zeer capabele collega's.
Continue leermogelijkheden (vb. on the job, kennisdeling van/met collega's en klanten, BDO Academy, …)
Ook de kans om mee te werken in de andere technische domeinen (RPA, Applicatie Integratie, ERP Implmentatie).
Deelnemen aan innovatieve projecten binnen BDO business lines zoals accounting, audit, tax, corporate finance om mee te werken aan de verdere digitalisatie van deze services, waarin data analyse een grote rol zal spelen.
Tot slot mag een competitief beloningspakket met uitgebreide extralegale voordelen niet ontbreken (en uiteraard een bedrijfswagen).

We never leave anyone behind. We deliver quickly – and outstandingly. We’re big on honesty because it makes us better. We’re empowered by our mission. And if cybercriminals have a good day, we work twice as hard to make the rest of their days a nightmare. That’s The Mimecast Way.




And the Mimecast way is also a hybrid-working way. We empower our people to balance their time between home and the office in a way that works best for them, their team, and our stakeholders.




Become a Mimecaster and put corporate data under your protection. Fill our teams with respect. And bring cybercrime-obstructing energy to your work. Be passionate. Be powerful. Be alive with purpose.




DEI Statement




Cybersecurity is a community effort. That’s why we’re committed to building an inclusive, diverse community that celebrates and welcomes everyone – unless they’re a cybercriminal, of course.




We’re proud to be an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Employer, and we’d encourage you to join us whatever your background. We particularly welcome applicants from traditionally underrepresented groups.




We consider everyone equally: your race, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, marital status, nationality, or any other protected characteristic won’t affect your application.




Due to certain obligations to our customers, an offer of employment will be subject to your successful completion of applicable background checks, conducted in accordance with local law.




In an effort to protect the health and resilience of our global community, Mimecast requires all individuals to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and/or receive a negative test before entry into our offices.

The internet is too important to billions of people for it to be at the mercy of a few powerful companies.

Like Polkadot, Parity was built on a foundation of being decentralised and open, which trickles down to how we work. We're a distributed organisation and have been from the beginning. Being distributed isn't just a way of doing business—it's a mentality that is at the core of our culture. We have a flat structure that pushes power to the edges and empowers our people to take ownership of their role, authority coupled with responsibilities.

As the Polkadot ecosystem grows, so does the data associated with it. We are looking for a data analytics professional to perform analytics on all our marketing activities, drive the definition of metrics and implement reporting structures within the Marketing & Communications (Marcomms) department at Parity Technologies.

This is a great opportunity for someone who is passionate about marketing, Web3 and open source blockchain development to spearhead some cutting edge analytics within the Blockchain industry. Also the ability to play a pivotal role in the formation of the data platform and culture at a rapidly growing open-source technology startup.

Key Responsibilities

Lead metric definition and measurement for the department, including supporting the KPI and OKR framework and processes
Work directly with a variety of stakeholders and multiple data sets to derive sophisticated data solutions and dashboards
Create and maintain dashboards to visualize the performance (ROI, attribution etc) of different marketing activities (social media, paid advertising, website traffic, CRM, organic content etc.)
Support the mapping of existing business processes into reporting structures.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on marketing data and open-source blockchain development data within and outside the ecosystem.
Coordinate with the data engineering team to turn the results of this EDA into user-friendly, consumable and automated dashboards.
Coordinate with other departments within Parity to help ensure organizational-wide visibility of Ecosystem Development data.


Qualification and Skills

3+ years of work experience in data analytics.
Strong proficiency in Python,SQL and dashboarding tools.
Experience defining metrics, implementing reporting structures, building and automating dashboards.
Professional experience with marketing data (paid ads, website traffic, CRM etc.) workflows and activities
Knowledge and practical application of statistical techniques in a professional setting.
Familiarity with connecting and harnessing data from a number of different sources.
Ability to work autonomously, be proactive, prioritise, communicate, and function in a small team.
Strong program management skills and able to address multiple projects in parallel managing competing interests and aligning various parties on a common goal.
Ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.


Nice-to-haves

Understanding of blockchain technologies and ecosystems.
Experience with GCP.
Knowledge of GDPR.


Benefits

Working at Parity means focusing on the stuff that counts: building the most cutting-edge technology for the future web. Our teams enjoy a high degree of trust, freedom and autonomy to achieve that goal.
You will gain a keen understanding of blockchain technology and business development and have a skill set transferable to many jobs.
Because we value initiative and learning, we've defined a generous personal budget to attend conferences or skills courses of your choosing. We think you know what's best for you!
Parity is a diverse company with people from various countries, and we will support you with German or English language courses where needed.
Not all of us who collaborate work in the same place. Bringing the team together is something we value a lot, so we regularly go on team retreats.

Set-up and own key performance indicators for the team, including activity tracking, and proactively flagging customer related issues
Design experiments and track their performance to provide data-driven insights
Enable your team and direct stakeholders to independently leverage data for business insights via dashboarding tools (e.g. Looker)

We want people to work from where they’re most comfortable, which is why we’re using a hybrid workplace model at Vinted for the foreseeable future.

Hybrid means that we encourage working from the office on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and the remainder of your time from either home or the office, but it’s not required. You’re welcome to work from either location all or some of the time, depending on what you think is best and safest for you, and how the Covid-19 situation is developing where you are.

The salary range for this position is 51,400 – 81,700 € (gross) per year.

If this sounds interesting – you may well be just who we need!

MORE THAN A JOB:

Blacklane is a scale-up started in 2011, founded by Jens Wohltorf and Frank Steuer who wanted to create the first global chauffeur service. We started by filling chauffeurs' 'empty leg' journeys and have grown with our partners to over €100 million in annual revenue (pre-pandemic). Backed by Daimler and other investors in Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the UAE, we're now a trusted brand within corporate travel.

We believe in ethical business practices and have a strong company culture. Responding to the pandemic, we've successfully managed the crises and retained our talented crew!

Continuous Learning: We believe that open and actionable feedback is the essential component of continuous development. Set your personal development plan and take an active role in our internal learning communities to progress your career.
Flexible Working: Even the most ambitious Blacklaner needs some time to unwind. Find out what works for you and your team with flexible working hours and home office days (working from home is the new normal).
Become Part of the Crew: Get to know your fellow Blacklaners through our regular team socials. Our success comes from a collaboration of more than 350 people from 70 nations and we are looking for more exceptional people to join us!
Employee Stock Options Plan: We want all Blacklaners to benefit from the company's success, so every employee gets virtual stock options.
Fair Remuneration: We've banded salary levels and matched them to the local costs of living, meaning you're always paid fairly and you know that the rest of the crew is too.
Sustainability: We care for both people and the planet, having launched the mobility's industry first global carbon offset scheme in 2017. Blacklane has pledged to deliver 75% of its journeys in electric vehicles by 2025.
Equal Opportunity: We are committed to inclusion and diversity. A company is only as strong as its crew, so we developed a work environment that is inclusive, inspiring and open. All qualified applicants receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.
