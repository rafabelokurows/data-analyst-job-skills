The internet is too important to billions of people for it to be at the mercy of a few powerful companies.

Like Polkadot, Parity was built on a foundation of being decentralised and open, which trickles down to how we work. We're a distributed organisation and have been from the beginning. Being distributed isn't just a way of doing business—it's a mentality that is at the core of our culture. We have a flat structure that pushes power to the edges and empowers our people to take ownership of their role, authority coupled with responsibilities.

As the Polkadot ecosystem grows, so does the data associated with it. We are looking for a data analytics professional to perform analytics on all our marketing activities, drive the definition of metrics and implement reporting structures within the Marketing & Communications (Marcomms) department at Parity Technologies.

Support the mapping of existing business processes into reporting structures.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on marketing data and open-source blockchain development data within and outside the ecosystem.
Coordinate with the data engineering team to turn the results of this EDA into user-friendly, consumable and automated dashboards.
Coordinate with other departments within Parity to help ensure organizational-wide visibility of Ecosystem Development data.


Qualification and Skills

3+ years of work experience in data analytics.
Strong proficiency in Python,SQL and dashboarding tools.
Experience defining metrics, implementing reporting structures, building and automating dashboards.
Professional experience with marketing data (paid ads, website traffic, CRM etc.) workflows and activities
Knowledge and practical application of statistical techniques in a professional setting.
Familiarity with connecting and harnessing data from a number of different sources.
Ability to work autonomously, be proactive, prioritise, communicate, and function in a small team.
Strong program management skills and able to address multiple projects in parallel managing competing interests and aligning various parties on a common goal.
Ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.


Nice-to-haves

Understanding of blockchain technologies and ecosystems.
Experience with GCP.
Knowledge of GDPR.


Benefits

Working at Parity means focusing on the stuff that counts: building the most cutting-edge technology for the future web. Our teams enjoy a high degree of trust, freedom and autonomy to achieve that goal.
You will gain a keen understanding of blockchain technology and business development and have a skill set transferable to many jobs.
Because we value initiative and learning, we've defined a generous personal budget to attend conferences or skills courses of your choosing. We think you know what's best for you!
Parity is a diverse company with people from various countries, and we will support you with German or English language courses where needed.

We want to make second-hand the first choice worldwide.

A team of 1,200+ people from Vinted’s offices in Vilnius, Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam develop and support our platform. We share a unique work culture that’s based on aiming high, taking ownership, co-creating, caring, and growth.

Vinted is committed to building an inclusive workplace where people from all walks of life feel a sense of belonging. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, colour, national origin, citizenship, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion/beliefs, disability or age. We truly believe when we can be fully ourselves, we work better.

As a Decision Scientist at Vinted Go, you will be part of a newly introduced Vinted business – our own VGo Platform designed to provide shipping services for external clients. You will help the team to make data-driven decisions by performing data analyses, applying statistical methods and building automated dashboards. In this position you will apply decision science principles to optimise platform’s growth, visualise data, and identify opportunities. To achieve that, you will work together with a dedicated cross-functional product team which consists of engineers and a product manager.

Within Data Science & Analytics at Vinted, we have three distinct roles. We believe that each role can make a similarly-sized business impact, and therefore our salary ranges are the same for all three roles. To better understand your role as a Decision Scientist, here are brief descriptions of each role in the department:

Decision Scientists are responsible for actionable insights, identifying and sizing opportunities, and developing automated tools that increase the quality of product and business decisions by applying statistical methods and data-driven decision making.
Data Scientists are responsible for identifying algorithmic opportunities, ensuring those opportunities are addressed in an optimal fashion and design, developing and maintaining production-grade statistical and machine learning algorithms.
Analytics Engineers are responsible for data curation: Translating data needs from stakeholders into architecting, building and maintaining efficient & reliable data models and pipelines.


In this position, you’ll:

Collaborate with your team and direct stakeholders to identify strategic opportunities and answer key business questions
Ensure these questions are answered in an optimal fashion (e.g. in the form of an ad-hoc deep-dive, experiment, dashboard, or automatically recurring analysis)
Set-up and own key performance indicators for the team, including activity tracking, and proactively flagging customer related issues
Design experiments and track their performance to provide data-driven insights
Enable your team and direct stakeholders to independently leverage data for business insights via dashboarding tools (e.g. Looker)
Help to create a backlog with prioritised hypotheses and analyses
Drive the usage of data & analytics within the organisation


About you:

Highly results-oriented and comfortable with iterative processes
Analytically curious with strong business acumen and strategic thinking
Fluent in SQL and working experience in an analytics language (Python, R, etc.)
Experience with dashboarding tools (e.g. Looker, Tableau, etc.)
Statistical proficiency (e.g. A/B testing, regression analysis)
Extensive work experience in analytical / data / BI fields
Excellent at communicating in written and spoken English
Advantage: Experience working in a tech company or in a cross-functional product development team


Work perks:

Opportunity to join our share options programme
Learning budget (10% from net yearly salary)
30 working days of holiday
Mental and emotional health support from Mindletic
Frequent team-building events
A personal budget for shopping on Vinted
A daily allowance for ordering lunch
Work anywhere in the EU for 90 days out of the year
Dog-friendly office
Home office support (IT workstation equipment provided and a personal budget for home workplace furniture)


We want people to work from where they’re most comfortable, which is why we’re using a hybrid workplace model at Vinted for the foreseeable future.

Hybrid means that we encourage working from the office on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and the remainder of your time from either home or the office, but it’s not required. You’re welcome to work from either location all or some of the time, depending on what you think is best and safest for you, and how the Covid-19 situation is developing where you are.

The salary range for this position is 51,400 – 81,700 € (gross) per year.

If this sounds interesting – you may well be just who we need!

We search, find and coordinate service capacities so that hospitals can focus on their patients rather than processes.

Within a very short time, Recare was able to onboard over 750 acute care and rehabilitation clinics as well as over 14 000 other service providers on its platform. Renowned hospitals and hospital groups such as Vivantes, Sana Kliniken AG, München Klinik, Hannover Medical School, and Essen University Hospital are among Recare's customers, as well as major health insurances such as TK, BKK and Barmer.

Example product use case - Rehabilitation

When a patient needs to be transferred to a rehabilitation clinic after a hospital stay, hospital staff currently have to:

fax (yes, fax...) forms to the patient's insurance to ask whether they are eligible for rehabilitation
find an available clinic offering the needed services (generally done by calling many and sharing patient data via fax).


With RECARE, hospital staff upload all relevant patient information in one place with the click of a button directly from the hospital’s information system, and can share it securely with all parties involved. An automated search is then started to find an available spot within our network of rehabilitation clinics.

Rehabilitation is just one of our use cases, we also cover care, transport, medical supplies and hospital transfers. Our product combines a SaaS with a marketplace to automate time-intensive tasks and free up hospital resources for patients rather than processes.

About Black Sheep Coffee…




Founded in 2013 when a group of friends decided to quit their jobs on the same day to “Leave The Herd Behind” and embark on a coffee mission of ridding the world of boring, average-tasting coffee.

Y TREE is a rapidly growing FinTech that is re-defining how individuals and families connect and engage with their money. We aim to make personal finance transparent, efficient and meaningful so that our understanding of wealth is re-defined to how we live, not what we own.

Team Overview

Maintaining accurate and up to date data is central to our business, and underpins everything we do for our clients. The Client Data Team is integral to our ability to maintain this data which is used to produce the analysis and in turn, the financial advice at the core of Y TREE.

The Role

To enable us to provide the analysis on their finances, clients entrust us with their confidential and sensitive financial statements accounting for their balance, income, cash flow, and equities. A core responsibility in this role will be to take those statements and ensure the correct data is transferred to our back office system.
You will carry out work for both prospect clients and those who are existing clients for the firm; your work will be central to the trust they build with Y TREE.
As part of the role, you will have the opportunity to work closely with both the Client Onboarding Team and Financial Life Strategy Team to obtain a holistic understanding of the journey of the data you have handled.
This role is a junior level role, but offers you the opportunity to build an understanding of how a financial services firm operates, an understanding of the data we handle and exposure to a variety of departments that are integral to a firm like ours. We really believe in supporting our team grow and develop and see this role as a pathway to progression in a regulated, or non- regulated role.


Requirements

The Technical Part

We don't need you to have any related work history for this role, but we are looking for graduates who have obtained a degree in anything that requires you to work with large sets of data. For example, previous candidates in this role have held degrees in Economics, Maths, Physics and Chemistry.
We will need you to not just tolerate the mathematical element of your degree, but enjoy it. This role requires you to work with large number sets and we would prefer it if this is something you like doing!


The Person

We are much more interested in who you are. This role gives you access to incredibly sensitive client data, so we would like you to be mature and trustworthy in your approach.
The deeper you embed yourself in this role, the more value you can add to our team. For that reason we would like you to be somebody with an inquisitive mind and a thirst for learning- this role can be what you make of it and previous candidates are now obtaining professional qualifications and moving into our Client Adviser career pathway.
As an agile business, we often deliver projects in cross functional teams so we would like you to be warm and engaging, with the ability to build strong, well-rounded relationships.
We are not a big financial institution (yet!) so you will need to be solutions-led and have the impetus and ability to proactively seek answers if you get stuck.
We would like you to have a methodical and detail orientated approach to work- you will be working with data after all!
We work at pace; outcomes are time sensitive so we would like you to be somebody who performs well under pressure.
Our community is where our power lies, so you must be an effective collaborator and confident speaking up and working as part of a small team that is building a business.
We are driving innovation in our area of personal finance and our product is a reflection of our team. We would like for you to be somebody who is intelligent, an independent thinker and somebody who is eager to share ideas.
We operate a very flat heirachy in the business, so we would like you to leave your ego at the door. Those with a people-centred approach are best suited to us and our team.


Benefits

What's in it for you?

The ability to hone your skills and cultivate your craft in a genuinely outcome led, flexible, happy work environment. We have a hybrid working policy and the ability to flex your hours as you need. We are all adults, and we understand work needs to balance your personal life too.
25 days of annual leave per year. This is 25 days each year we expect you to turn your phone off and switch off; we would never ask you to book leave for a doctor's appointment or to see your children's school plays.
Regular team socials to help you switch off from work and get to know your colleagues in an environment away from your desk. We ensure socials are well balanced and offer a variety of activities to suit different needs so you always feel welcome.
A welcoming, dog-friendly London office with appropriate spaces to cater for those with varying needs in the form of various breakout spaces and silent booths.
Support for your mental and physical health in the form of online fitness classes and access to a gym group in London.
A 3% pension contribution to help you save for the future
Family friendly policies

Add to that your knowledge of Tableau and SQL and you’ve got the making for your next position. You’re not expected to be the finished article and your learning and development will be a large focus here. Over time, you’ll become an expert with fixed income data and data analysis/insight in general.




You’ll be working closely with the front office of the business, creating a range of dashboards using Tableau to provide all kinds of insight around the fixed income markets. Requirements will vary and you will gather them directly from various stakeholders within the business. Sometimes all you’ll need to use is Tableau, whereas other may require slightly more data manipulation, giving you more exposure to Python, SQL and Snowflake.




You will of course get the training that you need across the asset class and technology.




With this role sitting within the business arm rather than technology, you’ll have great exposure to the front office, often seen as the most exciting part of financial firms. Of course, when you need technical help or training, the technology side of the business will be there to lend a hand.




In terms of your experience, you’ll need to have experience in another data analytics position, using Tableau. Python and SQL skills would be a huge plus, as would any prior exposure to Tableau.




The culture here is changing and with that you’ll only need to come to the office to work twice a week as a minimum. Starting salary will be up to £65,000 plus a performance related bonus and a range of benefits.




Want to learn all about fixed income investments? Get in touch.

Proven track record on the use of SQL, Splunk and/or Google Analytics tooling.
Experience developing service dashboards, writing ad-hoc queries, and improving them based on feedback.
Communicating complex information in a manner that is understandable and in the most appropriate format.

As a company of rational thinkers with big visions, our decisions—from the smallest app feature choices all the way up to the most dramatic strategic resolutions—must rest on robust foundations of truth. To make this happen, we’re looking for a brilliant, business-driven number-cruncher, savvy enough to run SQL queries and code their way around large amounts of data—someone who’s completely obsessed with data and finding (often counterintuitive) answers to complex, crucial questions.




A few examples of your responsibilities

Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.




What we look for

Logical-analytical abilities. You’re a quick learner who’s able to investigate and effectively pick up new concepts on your own. You can solve unforeseen challenges with creativity and structure, and can do so independently.
Relevant knowledge. You don’t need to be a walking encyclopedia on the topic, but you do need to know your ABCs from your XYZs. A solid and ever-expanding knowledge base is a prerequisite—you spend a hearty portion of your time seeking to fill in the gaps in your understanding.
Organization and structure. You’re meticulously organized and superbly structured, so you can handle multiple tasks and responsibilities with poise and precision.
Pragmatism. Far from being too academic or obsessive in your perfectionism, you understand that speed is often as important as quality when getting things done in a competitive world.
Curiosity and initiative. You love exploring, and are forever hunting down new opportunities and testing fresh ideas. Rather than waiting to be told what to do, you go seek.
Passion. You love what you do, and your enthusiasm never wavers with the specifics of a given task or team. Whether you’re on a plane, train, or sofa, odds are that you’ll be found with your nose in a book or article on the subject.
Drive. You’re energetic and hard-working, and you persevere through adversity until the job is done—and done impeccably. You’re massively into getting results, and always aim for excellence in what you do.
Communication skills. You can pose questions with clarity and explain your reasoning concisely.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.




What we offer

Lots. Of. Data. With millions of users, hundreds of thousands of new users every day, and a large, diverse, and ever-growing portfolio of products, Bending Spoons is the perfect playground for a data nerd (we know you are—we are too!).
The finest tools. You get the best hardware on the market and all the software you could need. We can't wait to introduce you to our high-tech approach and our cutting-edge workflows.
Talented, knowledgeable colleagues. Learn from (and teach) some of the brightest and most skilled people you’ll ever meet. Your talent is going to blossom here.
Make a difference. Be the owner of your effort—from day one, you’re one of the team and fully trusted to take responsibility for your tasks. You’ll have every incentive to make a major impact.
Unique career opportunity. By joining a fast-growing company on a mission to become one of the world's greatest, it’s an unparalleled opportunity to turbocharge your learning and career prospects.
Continuous education. Spooners get unlimited backing for learning investments, including Italian or English lessons and things like courses, conferences, and books. There’s no permission or approval process—you’re fully trusted to use the company’s resources efficiently.
Flexible schedule. Our regular hours are 9-6 GMT+1, but this isn’t a “clock in, clock out” company. You’re fully trusted to create the right conditions for your own personal peak productivity. We only ask that you’re available to your teammates a good chunk of the day (six hours or so). That’s why it’s generally best to be based somewhere with a similar time zone—between GMT-2 and GMT+3.
Unlimited time off. Take all the time you need to be with your family or just recharge your batteries. There’s no maximum number of days off, and there isn't any kind of permission process. We just ask that you make your vacation decisions mindfully.
Remote working. Spend as much or as little time in our Milan office as you choose. Many Spooners like to change up their environment and get out of the city whenever the mood strikes. You’ve always got the freedom to decide where today’s office is.
Competitive salary and stock options. Our compensation package is highly competitive, and can grow rapidly and include stock options, depending on your performance and seniority.




Commitment & contract

Full time or part-time. Permanent or fixed-term (depending on seniority).




Location

Milan, Italy or fully remote.

If you choose the on-site option, it’s also fine to sometimes work remotely. We offer substantial support for relocation, including finding an apartment in Milan and paying the rent for 12 weeks.




The selection process

If you successfully pass through our screening process, we’ll invite you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach and solve unfamiliar problems. These tests don’t require any prior knowledge, and they should take a few hours to complete. If you’re successful there, we’ll invite you to take part in some interviews—normally two or three—to get to know each other and figure out if it’s a good fit for both parties. The interviews are held remotely, and include some behavioral and problem-solving questions. To limit human bias, all of our hiring decisions are made by a hiring committee rather than any individual.




Spooners come from all over the world and English is our working language. We welcome applications in English or Italian—whichever suits you best!




All interviews and assessments take place in English and are held online.




Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment all applicants, regardless of their race, religion, color, ancestry, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, pregnancy, political affiliation, disability, and any other legally protected characteristic. We’re committed to providing reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities in our recruiting process. If you need any assistance or accommodations, please let us know at accommodations-ext@bendingspoons.com.

Small and medium size businesses are the lifeblood of the economy. Around the world, they supply vital goods and valuable services. Powering partnerships, increasing innovation, and driving progress.

Our growth has been fast and exciting. We were the first FinTech company to introduce global card-to-card transfers, connecting 12 billion cards issued by the international payment systems Mastercard, Visa, China Union Pay and local cards schemes, and we have strategic partnerships with many of the world's top payment companies. Born in April 2017, we now serve customers in over 150 countries and have over 200 employees, having more than doubled in size since March 2020.

In May 2021, we secured US$125 million in a Series B funding round which valued the company at US$700+ million. Since then we've expanded into Asia-Pacific with the opening of our Singapore headquarters, we've opened our Americas and LatAm headquarters in Miami, and recently launched our new European Technology Centre in Belgrade, Serbia. Additionally, we've been recognized by Deloitte as the third fastest growing technology company in the UK in 2022, as well as featuring in Sifted's UK start-ups and scale-ups to watch in 2022 ranking.

Paysend is one of the most popular and trusted digital money services in the world with 4.7/5 Trustpilot score

Our success is built on supreme technology, friendly customer service and, of course, the very best talent in the FinTech industry.

Every day is a new challenge at Paysend, and we approach each project with ambition, innovation and creativity.

Working within the People and Culture team, the main objective will be to help us partner with the business to turn people data into insights that will enable business stakeholders to understand their teams, what matters most to them and act accordingly. This is a summer internship starting late June/early July.

What you'll be doing:

Developing dashboard with clear data visualisations in Tableau and superset (or a similar reporting tool)
Help us connect all of our people data into a single data warehouse and as such SQL knowledge is appreciated
Help us explore opportunities for automation using any script/language of your choice
Conduct descriptive, confirmatory and exploratory data analysis
Work in an agile manner to help us use the insights generated to lead to real change


What you'll need to be successful:

Currently pursuing a bachelor's or master's degree that provides dedicated modules for math or scientific study
Enjoy working with data and have knowledge or experience with SQL (or other query language) and general-purpose programming languages such as Python or R
Have proven analytical and problem-solving skills
A real curiosity to understand for how things work and how they can be improved
Ability to communicate complex information in a clear and simple manner
Mindset that focuses on reaching core of problems; not just the first issue encountered


Why Paysend?

We're looking for people who share our passion for innovation, buy into the Paysend ethos and add value to our team. When you join Paysend, you'll have the chance to grow and develop as the business does.

We believe in empowering people to be successful in their jobs, and we pay them fairly for their expertise. We give everyone the context and tools to operate as business owners and encourage our people to contribute with their hearts, minds and creativity.

In the fast-paced FinTech industry the Paysend journey may not always be easy, but we succeed by working together to create solutions that break the status quo. We employ the right people to help us steer the business towards success and global influence.

If Paysend sounds like the perfect company for you, we'd love to hear from you!

You are joining a small team at the early stages of our greenfield journey. We are looking for someone who is ready and willing to roll sleeves up and get stuck into setting up our data management capabilities. You will have experience with the journey to build up a modern data framework and with your drive and innovation you are ready to deliver data management and data quality for the business.

Who We Are
GWI was founded with the knowledge that understanding your audience is really important for business. When you know who you’re speaking to and why, you can create content and campaigns that stand out to the people that matter.
Through our global online survey, we gather data on the behaviour and perceptions of consumers across the world. This provides businesses with deep, actionable insights on their audience, revealed from data they trust.
It’s been going well, too. Since launching in 2009, we’ve become one of the UK’s fastest growing target audience companies. We’re not about to stop growing any time soon. As a business, we’re on a mission to re-engineer data-driven marketing, and we’re on the lookout for talented people to join us.
Diversity & Inclusion
Imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. We’d get a very nuanced view of the world. And we definitely wouldn’t have got off the ground as a business.
Although things certainly aren’t perfect, we live in a society where differences are increasingly celebrated – so we’d expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, it’s really important to us that it stays that way. This is a place to feel at home, express yourself freely and make your mark.

In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, it’s really important to us that it stays that way. This is a place to feel at home, express yourself freely and make your mark.

Hey, Hi, Hello! 👋

My name is Connor Wilson. I’m the Founder and CEO of Pilot.

We’re a travel app company with the mission of helping people like you around the world have an awesome time and make memories offline, so you and others can live a happier, more fulfilling life.

But before I talk about us, I want to talk about you. ** If you’re reading this job description, you’re probably either unemployed and need a job…

…or you’re already employed, but for some reason or another…

…you’re here…

…because whether you realize it or not, you’re not as happy as you could be.

There could be a lot of reasons for this. Here’s a few:

🚩You’re overworked and/or underappreciated
🚩You lack faith, trust or closeness to your colleagues or leaders
🚩Your company is bureaucratic, lacks transparency, or makes top-down decisions
🚩You lack autonomy, freedom, or potential for growth
🚩You’re bored, aren’t learning or being challenged, or don’t care about what you’re working on or what your company does or who it serves
🚩Your company has an unhealthy/undesirable culture

We’ve been there.




I’m here to tell you it doesn’t have to be that way.




You know it doesn’t.




Remember that project back in school or earlier in your life/career that you really enjoyed or got super passionate about? That didn’t feel like work did it? It was fun. Well your job shouldn’t either. Especially considering we spend most of our lives at our jobs.




Is your current company going to give you that?




Why you should work at Pilot 🙋‍♀️

If you think you’d like working at a company whose very purpose is to give you and others the absolute best life possible, in the most fun way possible, working on cool things with cool people, to help people have an awesome time and make memories…




…well then Pilot might just be the place for you.




It’s embedded into who we are. That’s why we have a public 21-page culture code. Read it here to see if we vibe: https://bit.ly/3KmavZF




At Pilot you’ll get…

🌴 A 4 day workweek, with unlimited paid vacation (with manager approval/coordination) and get compensated competitively through salary and stock options so you’ll own your work.
🙌 Near total autonomy and freedom. You pick your own projects, set your own goals, and work the hours you want, where you want, with who you want. Our team travels all over the world - you can too.
🎊 Work with people who all want to be your friend (we actually hang out). Our team is incredibly talented, but we value humility.
🤓 Leaders who own their mistakes (yes, that includes me), actively seek feedback to identify and solve them, and are pretty experienced. You can learn more about me here: https://www.connorjwilson.com. TL’DR: this isn’t my first startup; my last tech startup sold for 8-figures after we grew it for 3 years without investors, reaching $3.5 million in annual recurring revenue.
🧪 Decisions based on data, not based on that Linkedin post your manager saw that one time. Everyone at any every level is empowered to make decisions because we share everything and have a culture of transparency, trust, and experimentation.
✈️ It’s travel, so it’s super fun. It’s a startup, so it’s super challenging with a huge upside. And, it’s social impact focused, so you’ll actually be helping people, not just maximizing profits.
🌎 We’re proud to have a diverse team, with an equal gender split, with plans to become a B-Corp.
⭐ We also have some great employer reviews here: glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Pilot-Reviews-E3311415.htm
🧳 We do paid travel benefits on occasion for training and research purposes. For example, some of our team went on a paid-for trip to Europe for 3 weeks in September to test the app in hostels across Europe. This was a very valuable experience and we will be doing more of it.




“Okay, but what even is Pilot?” 🤔

Great question. Glad you asked.

For young professionals looking to have an awesome time and make memories, Pilot is a Social Trip Planner that brings everything they need to discover, plan, book and relive trips with friends in one place. It’s a collaborative platform that helps them stress less and have more fun, while saving time & money.

🎓 We’re a Next Canada Accelerated and Creative Destruction Lab Acclerated Startup. That’s this: nextcanada.com and creativedestructionlab.com
🌱 We incorporated on Sixto de Mayo 2020. We missed Cinco de Mayo by one day and are still bitter about it. We spent the time since then iterating towards our current platform.
💸 We raised a small amount of money from investors, with plans to raise more.
😎 Today we’re a team of 12. Check out the team at pilotplans.com/careers
🏆 We recently released our beta publicly (try it at pilotplans.com)
🎉 We’re testing with an early access signup list of ~8,500 people
🚀 We’re growing crazy fast: In December 2021 we had about ~30,000 people visit our website per month. It's now ~190,000. That’s all from organic traffic, no ads.




So that’s us. Feel free to learn more about us at: pilotplans.com/careers




The role. The goal. 🛣️

Here’s what we’re looking for from you:

It’s very simple. We want someone to help us gather, analyze, and distribute data to our users as well and lead the development of our recommender system, as well as support the other parts of development.




What you’ll be doing and learning 🧑‍💻




These are entirely subject to change based on what gets the most results, but here goes:

Lead engineering efforts working with web scraping, APIs, data science, ML/AI, data pipelines, recommender systems, etc.
Build software with the our end user's experience as a priority
Build software that is positioned for intense growth, keeping scalability, maintainability, and extensibility in mind
Work cross functionally with our design, growth, and product teams to establish and execute our roadmap
Maintain ownership of code through its lifecycle from design to deployment
Suggest tools, cloud-based technologies/services and best practices to improve the site stability, performance and quality
Continually seeking ways to optimize and streamline Pilot’s web application platform to facilitate a seamless implementation experience for our developers and partners
Participate in an Agile development process, including scoping, technical design, estimation effort, coding, testing, debugging, code reviews, maintenance and support




You’ll need to be eager, ready to work hard, and able to work independently. We’re moving fast, and that means doing a lot more in less time, sometimes cutting corners to do so.




Still, work-life harmony is important so you’ll be the one setting your own goals to make sure they can be reasonably accomplished during your working hours.




“Should I apply??!??!?” 🤯

First of all, obviously.




It’s easy, and you can do it here: https://forms.gle/YkUNuHDijFNNJjj68




Second of all, as long as you think you have either the necessary skills, or the ability to learn them very quickly to do this role, you’re good. We care about your ability to execute, not your experience - though it certainly can be an indicator.




That said, the ideal candidate…

Is able to think, work, and learn independently, but is still a team player who works well with others.
Has strong spoken and written communication ability, and isn’t afraid to speak up to get clarity
Can convey complex topics simply
Has good understanding of human psychology, and a strong sense of empathy
Is very curious, who loves learning, and does it in their spare time
Loves travel and is an experienced traveler
5+ years of comparable experience
Ability to decompose complex problems into manageable units of work
Excellent verbal and written communication skills
BS or MS degree in Computer Science or equivalent




…and will need to have experience in the following:

deep expertise in data modelling and architecting
Strong experience with both noSQL and SQL databases
Data warehousing solutions and ETL pipelines
Strong background in data science/ML modelling
Should ideally be someone who's led a similar project successfully in a bigger company and would be passionate about doing so here




If you meet even 50-70% of these and all the must-have requirements you could be a great fit!




“I’m Interested, now what?” ⏭️




Wherever this job is posted (be it Angellist, Linkedin, Indeed, or some other site), submit your application here instead: https://forms.gle/YkUNuHDijFNNJjj68




This form replaces the need for a screening call so we can move straight to a proper interview if you’re selected!




Feel free to slide into our DMs with any questions.




Hope to hear from you soon!! 🙋‍♂️

We use computation as a powerful microscope to study both the fundamental biology of cancer initiation and progression, as well the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients in the hospital setting.




The successful candidate will be joining a collaborative team studying somatic mutations accumulated during therapy exposure, and how patterns of such mutations can introduce vulnerabilities for drug development. Other responsibilities will include method development and analysis for state-of-the-art liquid biopsy technologies to monitor therapy response during treatment and analysis of ‘omics’ data from different cancer types.




Principal Duties




Apply existing and novel algorithms to cancer data sets, analyze data quality, critically review and analyze results, communicate results to biologists, computational biologists, software engineers and clinicians.
Work with Cancer Center researchers to understand experimental procedures and the kinds of data produced (e.g. DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, epigenetic readouts, clinical outcome annotations). Meet and discuss with clinical and experimental colleagues to identify analytical challenges and goals.
Explore novel data visualization tools, with emphasis on integrating diverse data types and extracting clinically relevant insights.
Contribute to scientific writing and creation of data figures to be included in research publications




Required Skills & Qualifications




B.A/B.S. in one of Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Biology, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or a related quantitative discipline. Masters preferred.
Independent, self-motivated drive to push research forward.
Excellent programming skills (using any of R, Matlab, Java, Python, Perl, C, etc.)
Nimble approach to programming and data analysis, with an emphasis on simple, intuitive, reasoning: quickly open unfamiliar datasets, generate simple visualizations to project the data onto our brains as usefully as possible, to stimulate hypothesis generation and the next steps of the analysis.
Comfort using Word, Excel, Powerpoint or Google Suite tools to communicate results between team members.
Ability to work together with multi-disciplinary teams comprising physicians, biologists, statisticians, and software engineers.
Strong organizational and record-keeping skills
Fluency in spoken and written English

NewGlobe supports visionary governments to transform public education systems, the cornerstone of a prosperous, equitable, and peaceful society.




With a comprehensive system transformation platform and data-driven educational services, NewGlobe delivers rapid and dramatic improvements in learning outcomes at state and nationwide scale. Through building impactful partnerships and programmes, NewGlobe ensures that all children have access to an education that will develop their full potential and create a foundation for growth and prosperity.




NewGlobe leverages more than a decade of educational experience and proven impact in integrated school management, teacher professional development, instructional design innovation, technological system support, child-centered classroom practice, and parent engagement -- all grounded in learning science -- to ensure each teacher is empowered to engage children in transformational learning, and all children have the opportunity to develop to their full potential. Every day, NewGlobe supports governments to solve what were once seen as intractable problems, and by doing so, ensures this generation will be able to grow up to lead more fulfilled lives, while simultaneously building economic prosperity for themselves, their communities, and the globe.




NewGlobe’s high-touch, intensive professional development programs, along with integrated school management, teacher support, and assessment software, enable schools to succeed. NewGlobe works within state and national curriculum and syllabi, ensuring all children are empowered to learn their own history, and master local content, while being globally competitive in mathematics and languages. The science of behaviour change and the science of learning is at the foundation of all programming.




NewGlobe works with urgency because youth quickly becomes adulthood and relentlessly because improvement requires continuous problem-solving. NewGlobe is honoured to serve and to help rebuild trust in public systems.




NewGlobe’s work is all encompassing and will challenge you to use your full mind, and heart, each day. We need bright minds who want to be part of building a new globe -- a more equitable globe -- to join us.




Academics




The objective of the Academics group is to drive student achievement. To do so, we must know what is happening minute-by-minute for the typical child. The student’s daily experience, and thus the path to achievement, emerges from their relationship with the teachers and the content that is delivered in the classroom. Our team is collaboratively organized around these levers. We develop rigorous content pitched at the right level for students to be delivered by a teacher who is prepared to succeed in the classroom. Our Instructional Design department builds the content; our Leadership & Development department trains teachers and school leaders using scientifically-proven techniques; our Learning Innovation department looks at cutting-edge research to generate breakthrough learning gains. Underpinning all of this is the work of the independent Measurement and Evaluation group, which provides Academics with an empirical orientation toward improving that daily experience and, in turn, driving achievement.




Measurement & Evaluation




The Measurement & Evaluation team at NewGlobe is housed within the Academics group and collaborates across departments to help leaders assess the quality of teaching and learning at NewGlobe. We work to answer the core questions of “How well are we doing?”, “Are we getting better?”, and “How can we get even better?”. We blend quantitative analyses with qualitative field work to measure what matters most, provide feedback to NewGlobe school leaders and managers, assess our impact on student learning, and communicate the results to various internal and external audiences.




At the heart of our work is comparative analysis. We compare student learning at NewGlobe across time and place. In all of our locations, we examine how much faster NewGlobe students learn than their peers in similar schools. We examine how student performance today compares to student performance yesterday. We examine sub-groups of students to advance equity. We examine variability across our schools to determine which characteristics matter most to student learning. We help NewGlobe managers assess the impact of the changes they have made to accelerate learning.




We take pride in providing rigorous measurement, study design, and analysis. We also take pride in our ability to communicate clearly in words, tables, and data visualizations. We intend our work to make a difference in how NewGlobe managers and our government partners think and act. We judge our own work accordingly.




Collaboration sits at the heart of M&E at NewGlobe. We collaborate with our internal team members as well as with our government partners. With every product, we enter into a collaborative conversation with those who operate and those who study. M&E has established deep partnerships with the education ministries, with local research organizations, and with international researchers who focus on teaching and learning, especially those who focus on the aspects of schooling most relevant to the students we serve.




About The Role




We are seeking a full-time M&E Data Analyst to join our team. We are looking for someone eager to conduct impactful research, share their expertise, and build upon a tradition of evaluation and data excellence at NewGlobe.




The Data Analyst is responsible for supporting the data analysis of different descriptive analyses and impact evaluations within the organization. These analyses can range from simple descriptive analyses using a few Excel formulas, to more complex work using multiple Stata or R scripts. To do this, the Analyst will need to manage all parts of the data analysis process - starting from the design stage through the execution of analyses, and the reporting of the findings to other internal stakeholders.




The analyst is responsible for the provision of high-quality data products that other colleagues can rely on, and build their own work on. As such, this role is at the core of a large portion of all the M&E efforts within NewGlobe, and in consequence, at the intersection of our evaluation efforts to continually deliver stronger education to our students. We view data and analytics as core to our ability to learn as an organization. We want to cultivate data and analytics rock stars, people who produce and use data to reveal actionable insights for NewGlobe’s rapidly growing network of schools. The person in this role will receive constant coaching and mentoring from the rest of the M&E and Data Analytics team, and professional development will be a core feature of this role.




The M&E Analyst should be willing to work in Cambridge, MA. The M&E Analyst will report to the Director, M&E. Significant travel is required.




What You Will Do




Clean and analyze data sets. These data sets can be used to answer questions from a wide range of topics like academic performance, impact evaluation studies, internal RCTs, among others.
Ensure the creation of proper data pipelines and best data management practices.
Contribute to a culture of data-driven decision-making by collaborating with various team members across territories.
Accommodate requests for quick analyses. Time-sensitive questions will come from the VPs and C-Level Executives, and usually take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Oftentimes, you will need to direct your staff to use their best judgment in the face of imperfect data.
Other duties as required by the Directors and VP of M&E, and C-level executives.
What You Should Have




High data literacy and a strong background in econometrics and/or statistics. Previous experience in an academic or applied setting, such as being an analyst, research assistant, data manager, or consultant. Experience in data cleaning, analysis, and/or visualization.
A high level of proficiency with Stata or R, and Excel. Any other data analysis software or coding language is a plus. Experience with survey software like Qualtrics, SurveyCTO, or Google Forms is also a plus.
Undergraduate degree (or its equivalent) or Masters degree – in a relevant academic discipline, for example (but not limited to) Economics, Public or Education Policy, or Statistics.
Strong communication skills and the ability to translate complex ideas for non-technical audiences – you will need effective verbal and written communication skills to provide valuable insights and research reports for internal and external stakeholders.
Belief in data-driven decision making.
Flexible and loves to work in a dynamic environment.
Passion – for NewGlobe’s mission.
Bonus – experience in extreme growth situations and dealing with complexity; worked/studied in a developing country, worked in a no-excuses charter school in high-poverty areas in the U.S., and/or experience implementing data collection projects, particularly for impact evaluations.
You’re also




A detailed doer – You have a track record of getting things done. You’re organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company.
A networking mastermind – You excel at meeting new people and turning them into advocates. You communicate in a clear, conscientious, and effective way in both written and oral speech. You can influence strangers in the course of a single conversation. Allies and colleagues will go to bat for your ideas. You have an existing network from prior experience in the country, preferably in the regulatory, education, or business sectors.
A creative problem-solver – Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, NewGlobe works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand.
A relentless advocate –The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent’s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience, and value.
A malleable learner –You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you’ve missed things or failed today.
A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don’t just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.

        <strong>Who We Are</strong><p><br></p>NewGlobe supports visionary governments to transform public education systems, the cornerstone of a prosperous, equitable, and peaceful society.<p><br></p>With a comprehensive system transformation platform and data-driven educational services, NewGlobe delivers rapid and dramatic improvements in learning outcomes at state and nationwide scale. Through building impactful partnerships and programmes, NewGlobe ensures that all children have access to an education that will develop their full potential and create a foundation for growth and prosperity.<p><br></p>NewGlobe leverages more than a decade of educational experience and proven impact in integrated school management, teacher professional development, instructional design innovation, technological system support, child-centered classroom practice, and parent engagement -- all grounded in learning science -- to ensure each teacher is empowered to engage children in transformational learning, and all children have the opportunity to develop to their full potential. Every day, NewGlobe supports governments to solve what were once seen as intractable problems, and by doing so, ensures this generation will be able to grow up to lead more fulfilled lives, while simultaneously building economic prosperity for themselves, their communities, and the globe.<p><br></p>NewGlobe’s high-touch, intensive professional development programs, along with integrated school management, teacher support, and assessment software, enable schools to succeed. NewGlobe works within state and national curriculum and syllabi, ensuring all children are empowered to learn their own history, and master local content, while being globally competitive in mathematics and languages. The science of behaviour change and the science of learning is at the foundation of all programming.<p><br></p>NewGlobe works with urgency because youth quickly becomes adulthood and relentlessly because improvement requires continuous problem-solving. NewGlobe is honoured to serve and to help rebuild trust in public systems.<p><br></p>NewGlobe’s work is all encompassing and will challenge you to use your full mind, and heart, each day. We need bright minds who want to be part of building a new globe -- a more equitable globe -- to join us.<p><br></p><strong> Academics </strong><p><br></p>The objective of the Academics group is to drive student achievement. To do so, we must know what is happening minute-by-minute for the typical child. The student’s daily experience, and thus the path to achievement, emerges from their relationship with the teachers and the content that is delivered in the classroom. Our team is collaboratively organized around these levers. We develop rigorous content pitched at the right level for students to be delivered by a teacher who is prepared to succeed in the classroom. Our Instructional Design department builds the content; our Leadership &amp; Development department trains teachers and school leaders using scientifically-proven techniques; our Learning Innovation department looks at cutting-edge research to generate breakthrough learning gains. Underpinning all of this is the work of the independent Measurement and Evaluation group, which provides Academics with an empirical orientation toward improving that daily experience and, in turn, driving achievement.<p><br></p><strong> Measurement &amp; Evaluation </strong><p><br></p>The Measurement &amp; Evaluation team at NewGlobe is housed within the Academics group and collaborates across departments to help leaders assess the quality of teaching and learning at NewGlobe. We work to answer the core questions of “How well are we doing?”, “Are we getting better?”, and “How can we get even better?”. We blend quantitative analyses with qualitative field work to measure what matters most, provide feedback to NewGlobe school leaders and managers, assess our impact on student learning, and communicate the results to various internal and external audiences.<p><br></p>At the heart of our work is comparative analysis. We compare student learning at NewGlobe across time and place. In all of our locations, we examine how much faster NewGlobe students learn than their peers in similar schools. We examine how student performance today compares to student performance yesterday. We examine sub-groups of students to advance equity. We examine variability across our schools to determine which characteristics matter most to student learning. We help NewGlobe managers assess the impact of the changes they have made to accelerate learning.<p><br></p>We take pride in providing rigorous measurement, study design, and analysis. We also take pride in our ability to communicate clearly in words, tables, and data visualizations. We intend our work to make a difference in how NewGlobe managers and our government partners think and act. We judge our own work accordingly.<p><br></p>Collaboration sits at the heart of M&amp;E at NewGlobe. We collaborate with our internal team members as well as with our government partners. With every product, we enter into a collaborative conversation with those who operate and those who study. M&amp;E has established deep partnerships with the education ministries, with local research organizations, and with international researchers who focus on teaching and learning, especially those who focus on the aspects of schooling most relevant to the students we serve.<p><br></p><strong>About The Role</strong><p><br></p>We are seeking a full-time M&amp;E Data Analyst to join our team. We are looking for someone eager to conduct impactful research, share their expertise, and build upon a tradition of evaluation and data excellence at NewGlobe.<p><br></p>The Data Analyst is responsible for supporting the data analysis of different descriptive analyses and impact evaluations within the organization. These analyses can range from simple descriptive analyses using a few Excel formulas, to more complex work using multiple Stata or R scripts. To do this, the Analyst will need to manage all parts of the data analysis process - starting from the design stage through the execution of analyses, and the reporting of the findings to other internal stakeholders.<p><br></p>The analyst is responsible for the provision of high-quality data products that other colleagues can rely on, and build their own work on. As such, this role is at the core of a large portion of all the M&amp;E efforts within NewGlobe, and in consequence, at the intersection of our evaluation efforts to continually deliver stronger education to our students. We view data and analytics as core to our ability to learn as an organization. We want to cultivate data and analytics rock stars, people who produce and use data to reveal actionable insights for NewGlobe’s rapidly growing network of schools. The person in this role will receive constant coaching and mentoring from the rest of the M&amp;E and Data Analytics team, and professional development will be a core feature of this role.<p><br></p>The M&amp;E Analyst should be willing to work in Cambridge, MA. The M&amp;E Analyst will report to the Director, M&amp;E. Significant travel is required.<p><br></p><strong>What You Will Do</strong><p><br></p><ul><li>Clean and analyze data sets. These data sets can be used to answer questions from a wide range of topics like academic performance, impact evaluation studies, internal RCTs, among others. </li><li>Ensure the creation of proper data pipelines and best data management practices. </li><li>Contribute to a culture of data-driven decision-making by collaborating with various team members across territories.</li><li>Accommodate requests for quick analyses. Time-sensitive questions will come from the VPs and C-Level Executives, and usually take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Oftentimes, you will need to direct your staff to use their best judgment in the face of imperfect data. </li><li>Other duties as required by the Directors and VP of M&amp;E, and C-level executives.</li></ul> <strong> What You Should Have </strong><p><br></p><ul><li>High data literacy and a strong background in econometrics and/or statistics. Previous experience in an academic or applied setting, such as being an analyst, research assistant, data manager, or consultant. Experience in data cleaning, analysis, and/or visualization. </li><li>A high level of proficiency with Stata or R, and Excel. Any other data analysis software or coding language is a plus. Experience with survey software like Qualtrics, SurveyCTO, or Google Forms is also a plus. </li><li>Undergraduate degree (or its equivalent) or Masters degree – in a relevant academic discipline, for example (but not limited to) Economics, Public or Education Policy, or Statistics. </li><li>Strong communication skills and the ability to translate complex ideas for non-technical audiences – you will need effective verbal and written communication skills to provide valuable insights and research reports for internal and external stakeholders. </li><li>Belief in data-driven decision making.</li><li>Flexible and loves to work in a dynamic environment.</li><li>Passion – for NewGlobe’s mission. </li><li>Bonus – experience in extreme growth situations and dealing with complexity; worked/studied in a developing country, worked in a no-excuses charter school in high-poverty areas in the U.S., and/or experience implementing data collection projects, particularly for impact evaluations. </li></ul> <strong> You’re also </strong><p><br></p><ul><li>A detailed doer – You have a track record of getting things done. You’re organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company. </li><li>A networking mastermind – You excel at meeting new people and turning them into advocates. You communicate in a clear, conscientious, and effective way in both written and oral speech. You can influence strangers in the course of a single conversation. Allies and colleagues will go to bat for your ideas. You have an existing network from prior experience in the country, preferably in the regulatory, education, or business sectors. </li><li>A creative problem-solver – Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, NewGlobe works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand. </li><li>A relentless advocate –The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent’s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience, and value. </li><li>A malleable learner –You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you’ve missed things or failed today. </li><li>A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don’t just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.</li></ul>

THE COMPANY




B-Stock is the world's largest B2B recommerce marketplace for excess [or surplus] merchandise. Businesses of all sizes leverage the B-Stock platform to sell and buy customer returns, overstock and other excess merchandise - ranging from top brands and retailers who want best-in-class inventory management to entrepreneurs looking to source valuable merchandise for their resale businesses.




Tens of thousands of small business owners all over the globe use B-Stock to launch and power their resale business. We take pride in empowering these innovators and entrepreneurs of commerce.




In 2020 we sold 120 million items across our platform, giving a second life to this otherwise would be “waste” merchandise. In fact, we kept 400 million pounds of goods in use and saved millions from the landfill. It feels good to be B-Stock!




The amount of returned or unsold inventory continues to grow each year, and in 2020, it was estimated at over $1 trillion worth worldwide. We know there is tremendous value in and demand for this inventory - no matter the category, condition, or location. The B-Stock platform gives buyers a simple way to buy brand-name merchandise directly from top retailers and manufacturers. At the same time, we offer companies an automated, trusted replacement for traditional liquidation while boosting operational efficiency, recovery rates, and cycle time.




Led by eBay veterans and backed by top investors including Spectrum Equity, True Ventures, and Susquehanna Growth Equity, B-Stock shows no signs of slowing down. Our core values have shaped the company we are today and will continue to drive our success for many years to come.

OUR VALUES




Make Each Dollar Count

Whether it’s the recovery amount or a buyer’s budget, money matters to all of our clients. And because each dollar matters to them, it matters to us.




Take Our Work Seriously, Not Ourselves

Everything at B-Stock continues to grow - everything but our egos, that is. We’re not afraid to let loose and laugh (often at ourselves).




Do The Hard Things Today That Will Pay Off Tomorrow

We’re willing to sacrifice and endure, fail and adapt to reach our long-term goals.




Use Trust As The Best Measure Of Success

The trust we earn along the way is more valuable than money. Without trust from both our buyers and sellers, our business won’t succeed.




Find Strength In Numbers

Use our passion for data to provide value to our customers, improve ourselves, and develop new ways to delight our buyers and sellers.










No applicant will face discrimination/harassment based on race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, or veteran status. Above and beyond discrimination/harassment based on “protected categories,” B-Stock also strives to prevent other, subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (e.g., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at B-Stock.

Technical. We’re a software company so you should be energized by a technical environment. You’re generally quick at learning and mastering new technologies and programs. No matter what your background is, everyone starts off learning all (and we mean all) the basics of our systems.
Marketing Chops. You understand how marketing teams operate and you're able (or willing to learn how) to provide insights and recommendations to customers in both marketing and sales.
