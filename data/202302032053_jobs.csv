The Data Science team provides research and technical expertise, support, oversight, and methodological development to our global operating services.




Within the team the data analyst supports other data scientists and developers with necessary data queries and runs periodic Quality Control analyses on live services.

Able to spot anomalies and gain conclusions
Quality control of modelling outcome data – generic models and client specific applications
Support with client’s liaison on technical issues

Role Requirements

Attention to details and accuracy
Critical thinking

Bachelor’s degree in highly numerate discipline

Y TREE is a rapidly growing FinTech that is re-defining how individuals and families connect and engage with their money. We aim to make personal finance transparent, efficient and meaningful so that our understanding of wealth is re-defined to how we live, not what we own.

Team Overview

Maintaining accurate and up to date data is central to our business, and underpins everything we do for our clients. The Client Data Team is integral to our ability to maintain this data which is used to produce the analysis and in turn, the financial advice at the core of Y TREE.

The Role

To enable us to provide the analysis on their finances, clients entrust us with their confidential and sensitive financial statements accounting for their balance, income, cash flow, and equities. A core responsibility in this role will be to take those statements and ensure the correct data is transferred to our back office system.
You will carry out work for both prospect clients and those who are existing clients for the firm; your work will be central to the trust they build with Y TREE.
As part of the role, you will have the opportunity to work closely with both the Client Onboarding Team and Financial Life Strategy Team to obtain a holistic understanding of the journey of the data you have handled.
This role is a junior level role, but offers you the opportunity to build an understanding of how a financial services firm operates, an understanding of the data we handle and exposure to a variety of departments that are integral to a firm like ours. We really believe in supporting our team grow and develop and see this role as a pathway to progression in a regulated, or non- regulated role.


Requirements

The Technical Part

We don't need you to have any related work history for this role, but we are looking for graduates who have obtained a degree in anything that requires you to work with large sets of data. For example, previous candidates in this role have held degrees in Economics, Maths, Physics and Chemistry.
We will need you to not just tolerate the mathematical element of your degree, but enjoy it. This role requires you to work with large number sets and we would prefer it if this is something you like doing!


The Person

We are much more interested in who you are. This role gives you access to incredibly sensitive client data, so we would like you to be mature and trustworthy in your approach.
The deeper you embed yourself in this role, the more value you can add to our team. For that reason we would like you to be somebody with an inquisitive mind and a thirst for learning- this role can be what you make of it and previous candidates are now obtaining professional qualifications and moving into our Client Adviser career pathway.
As an agile business, we often deliver projects in cross functional teams so we would like you to be warm and engaging, with the ability to build strong, well-rounded relationships.
We are not a big financial institution (yet!) so you will need to be solutions-led and have the impetus and ability to proactively seek answers if you get stuck.
We would like you to have a methodical and detail orientated approach to work- you will be working with data after all!
We work at pace; outcomes are time sensitive so we would like you to be somebody who performs well under pressure.
Our community is where our power lies, so you must be an effective collaborator and confident speaking up and working as part of a small team that is building a business.
We are driving innovation in our area of personal finance and our product is a reflection of our team. We would like for you to be somebody who is intelligent, an independent thinker and somebody who is eager to share ideas.
We operate a very flat heirachy in the business, so we would like you to leave your ego at the door. Those with a people-centred approach are best suited to us and our team.


Benefits

What's in it for you?

The ability to hone your skills and cultivate your craft in a genuinely outcome led, flexible, happy work environment. We have a hybrid working policy and the ability to flex your hours as you need. We are all adults, and we understand work needs to balance your personal life too.
25 days of annual leave per year. This is 25 days each year we expect you to turn your phone off and switch off; we would never ask you to book leave for a doctor's appointment or to see your children's school plays.
Regular team socials to help you switch off from work and get to know your colleagues in an environment away from your desk. We ensure socials are well balanced and offer a variety of activities to suit different needs so you always feel welcome.
A welcoming, dog-friendly London office with appropriate spaces to cater for those with varying needs in the form of various breakout spaces and silent booths.
Support for your mental and physical health in the form of online fitness classes and access to a gym group in London.
A 3% pension contribution to help you save for the future
Family friendly policies

Octopus Energy UK 🇬🇧 – Data /




Full-time




/ Hybrid







Help us make a big green dent in the universe. We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.




Octopus buys power directly from wind, solar and hydro sites all over the UK (and soon all over the world). This allows us to supply our customers with green electricity, straight from the source.




We’re looking for an Analyst to support us as we sign contracts to buy power from more and bigger renewable generators. This Analyst will lead on pricing, risk management and performance monitoring. This will all be done with a view to paying a fair price to renewable generators, and delivering green electricity to Octopus customers at the lowest possible cost.




The ideal candidate will have a passion for using data to enable the transition to renewable energy. And will be comfortable with all the moving parts and complexity that come with the energy industry.




This role will sit within the Octopus Energy Procurement team. However, this is not a typical Energy Procurement team. Instead of working in large, siloed teams, our trading, risk, forecasting and data science functions work closely together. We use technology to maintain a lean operation as the company grows. We focus on the big problems and give people the autonomy and resources to find innovative solutions.




What You'll Do




Create processes to track performance from contracting through to delivery, identifying areas for improvement.
Quantify and categorise risks in Octopus’s renewable energy origination processes.
Improve and maintain pricing tools, taking risks and historical performance into account.
Develop custom pricing proposals that are mutually beneficial to Octopus and renewable generators.
Work with the Forecasting Team to help Improve and maintain models for forecasting wind, solar and hydro generation at the level of the individual site.
Support the development of innovative commercial structures between Octopus's supply business and Octopus Energy GenerationDevelop alerting for generator outages or reduced performance.
Work with other teams at Octopus, including Strategy, Finance, Generation, Business, Hydrogen and many more.
Support Octopus businesses in other countries by sharing experience and best practices.




What You'll Need




Passion for renewables and the energy transition.
Desire to explore complex systems and an ability to learn fast.
Ability to communicate complicated concepts in a way that everyone can understand.
Commercial awareness and financial literacy to identify and understand the problems that need solving.
Comprehensive knowledge of data design, data modelling, data management and data visualisation.
Experience with a scripting language (ideally Python).Experience writing complex queries in SQL, analysing large datasets and building reports and dashboards.




If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.




Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success.

As a company of rational thinkers with big visions, our decisions—from the smallest app feature choices all the way up to the most dramatic strategic resolutions—must rest on robust foundations of truth. To make this happen, we’re looking for a brilliant, business-driven number-cruncher, savvy enough to run SQL queries and code their way around large amounts of data—someone who’s completely obsessed with data and finding (often counterintuitive) answers to complex, crucial questions.




A few examples of your responsibilities

Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.




What we look for

Logical-analytical abilities. You’re a quick learner who’s able to investigate and effectively pick up new concepts on your own. You can solve unforeseen challenges with creativity and structure, and can do so independently.
Relevant knowledge. You don’t need to be a walking encyclopedia on the topic, but you do need to know your ABCs from your XYZs. A solid and ever-expanding knowledge base is a prerequisite—you spend a hearty portion of your time seeking to fill in the gaps in your understanding.
Organization and structure. You’re meticulously organized and superbly structured, so you can handle multiple tasks and responsibilities with poise and precision.
Pragmatism. Far from being too academic or obsessive in your perfectionism, you understand that speed is often as important as quality when getting things done in a competitive world.
Curiosity and initiative. You love exploring, and are forever hunting down new opportunities and testing fresh ideas. Rather than waiting to be told what to do, you go seek.
Passion. You love what you do, and your enthusiasm never wavers with the specifics of a given task or team. Whether you’re on a plane, train, or sofa, odds are that you’ll be found with your nose in a book or article on the subject.
Drive. You’re energetic and hard-working, and you persevere through adversity until the job is done—and done impeccably. You’re massively into getting results, and always aim for excellence in what you do.
Communication skills. You can pose questions with clarity and explain your reasoning concisely.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.




What we offer

Lots. Of. Data. With millions of users, hundreds of thousands of new users every day, and a large, diverse, and ever-growing portfolio of products, Bending Spoons is the perfect playground for a data nerd (we know you are—we are too!).
The finest tools. You get the best hardware on the market and all the software you could need. We can't wait to introduce you to our high-tech approach and our cutting-edge workflows.
Talented, knowledgeable colleagues. Learn from (and teach) some of the brightest and most skilled people you’ll ever meet. Your talent is going to blossom here.
Make a difference. Be the owner of your effort—from day one, you’re one of the team and fully trusted to take responsibility for your tasks. You’ll have every incentive to make a major impact.
Unique career opportunity. By joining a fast-growing company on a mission to become one of the world's greatest, it’s an unparalleled opportunity to turbocharge your learning and career prospects.
Continuous education. Spooners get unlimited backing for learning investments, including Italian or English lessons and things like courses, conferences, and books. There’s no permission or approval process—you’re fully trusted to use the company’s resources efficiently.
Flexible schedule. Our regular hours are 9-6 GMT+1, but this isn’t a “clock in, clock out” company. You’re fully trusted to create the right conditions for your own personal peak productivity. We only ask that you’re available to your teammates a good chunk of the day (six hours or so). That’s why it’s generally best to be based somewhere with a similar time zone—between GMT-2 and GMT+3.
Unlimited time off. Take all the time you need to be with your family or just recharge your batteries. There’s no maximum number of days off, and there isn't any kind of permission process. We just ask that you make your vacation decisions mindfully.
Remote working. Spend as much or as little time in our Milan office as you choose. Many Spooners like to change up their environment and get out of the city whenever the mood strikes. You’ve always got the freedom to decide where today’s office is.
Competitive salary and stock options. Our compensation package is highly competitive, and can grow rapidly and include stock options, depending on your performance and seniority.




Commitment & contract

Full time or part-time. Permanent or fixed-term (depending on seniority).




Location

Milan, Italy or fully remote.

If you choose the on-site option, it’s also fine to sometimes work remotely. We offer substantial support for relocation, including finding an apartment in Milan and paying the rent for 12 weeks.




The selection process

If you successfully pass through our screening process, we’ll invite you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach and solve unfamiliar problems. These tests don’t require any prior knowledge, and they should take a few hours to complete. If you’re successful there, we’ll invite you to take part in some interviews—normally two or three—to get to know each other and figure out if it’s a good fit for both parties. The interviews are held remotely, and include some behavioral and problem-solving questions. To limit human bias, all of our hiring decisions are made by a hiring committee rather than any individual.




Spooners come from all over the world and English is our working language. We welcome applications in English or Italian—whichever suits you best!




All interviews and assessments take place in English and are held online.




Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment all applicants, regardless of their race, religion, color, ancestry, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, pregnancy, political affiliation, disability, and any other legally protected characteristic. We’re committed to providing reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities in our recruiting process. If you need any assistance or accommodations, please let us know at accommodations-ext@bendingspoons.com.

MyTutor is the UK’s leading online platform for one-to-one learning, and we're on a mission to improve the educational outcomes of thousands of young people. We’re building a future where access to high-quality learning is stress-free for those who can afford it, and funded for those who can't.

One-to-one tuition is one of the most powerful ways to improve pupils’ grades, confidence and life chances. Yet it remains out of reach for many. Our handpicked community of tutors work online with students from all walks of life, raising results on average by one whole grade. Since Covid-19 and all the disruption to education, we've worked with the government to provide safe and reliable tuition to more students than ever. We're proud to have worked with over 650 schools across the UK, and our tutors have given over a million lessons.

Since the pandemic, we've scaled up and kept a working environment that encourages collaboration and support. We always prioritise our team's development and well-being, remotely right now, and in an office again in the future. We have regular company socials, and there are chances every week to sit down with someone for a cuppa and a chat.

The role in a nutshell:

Here at MyTutor we are growing our data team, and we’re looking for an experienced, data-driven and passionate Analytics professional to support our wider business.

You’ll be the 7th member of our collaborative data team, which is made up of data analysts, a data scientist and an analytics engineer. You’ll be working in a fast-paced environment with stakeholders across product, marketing, customer success, sales and business operations to drive deeper understanding of the impact of customer and tutor behaviour, acquisition and retention, and overall business health.

With your data expertise and commercial awareness, you’ll influence the strategy and decisions that fuel our rapid growth as we look to become one of the world’s leading learning platforms.

You’ll be working with our analytics engineer to ensure that we build insights in a sustainable fashion, getting a chance to develop your data modelling and coding skills along the way.

We work in an agile way, so expect daily stand-ups, regular retrospectives and beautifully crafted tickets!

Snowflake for our data warehouse
Stitch/Airbyte for data ingestion
dbt for data transformation
Paradime for lineage/data catalogue
HighTouch for reverse ETL
Machine learning using Python + Snowpark
Tableau and Lightdash for Data Visualisation


What you can expect:

Be one of the go-to people for business insights and provide a vital link in the strategy - execution - analysis chain to ensure we move quickly and stay ahead.
Lead analysis of various business areas, focused on developing the capability to translate data into actionable insights that will improve campaign performance.
Spend time building beautiful, well-tested and well-documented data models that make self-serve analytics easy
Work with our data scientist to support product discovery and experimentation using cutting-edge advanced analytics techniques
Drive deeper understanding of customer and tutor behaviours, and efficiency of business operations - anything from acquisition, churn and lifetime value to the efficiency of our tools in serving customers.
Assist with ad hoc queries and provide analytical support to our fast-growing business as it evolves.
Seek out new techniques and opportunities for greater efficiency as well as owning best practices across the data function.
A progression framework that includes pathways to analytics engineer and data scientist

You have a passion for solving ambiguous, complex and unstructured problems
You are a bar-raiser who sees improving those around you as important as your own delivery
You are comfortable working across multiple projects in a rapidly changing environment, able to balance the need for accuracy and efficiency to prioritise work.
You deliver accurate, meaningful and timely information, based on well-thought-through research and your interpersonal skills enable you to articulate complex concepts in simple terms to stakeholders.


Great if you have:

Experience with dbt (if you don’t have this, it’s basically just SQL with some config so if you’re a SQL whizz you’ll pick it up in no time!)
Experience with git
Experience with AB testing
Experience with GA (not a huge part of the role but we are currently light on GA skills in the team!)
Experience with digital/performance marketing


Benefits:

It’s been going well, too. Since launching in 2009, we’ve become one of the UK’s fastest growing target audience companies. We’re not about to stop growing any time soon. As a business, we’re on a mission to re-engineer data-driven marketing, and we’re on the lookout for talented people to join us.
Diversity & Inclusion
Imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. We’d get a very nuanced view of the world. And we definitely wouldn’t have got off the ground as a business.
Although things certainly aren’t perfect, we live in a society where differences are increasingly celebrated – so we’d expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, it’s really important to us that it stays that way. This is a place to feel at home, express yourself freely and make your mark.

Elektriciteit heeft de wereld grondig veranderd. Ook data is dit nu aan het doen. Data wordt door alle grote spelers gebruikt om te begrijpen wat er gebeurt en te voorspellen wat er gaat gebeuren (kijk maar naar Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc). KBC is geen uitzondering.




Het team dat jij als data-analist ondernemingskredieten versterkt, verwerkt data over kredieten aan zelfstandigen, KMO’s en large corporates.




We ondersteunen andere diensten binnen ons domein in hun zoektocht naar de juiste data en leveren die op een gestructureerde manier op via diverse toepassingen. Zo kunnen onze opdrachtgevers hun backend processen verder automatiseren, maar ook belangrijke inzichten verwerven om hun beleid of dagelijkse werking bij te sturen.




Het eindresultaat? Vlotte, gezonde kredietverlening aan ondernemers en ondernemingen, die de motor zijn van onze economie.




Zin om deze uitdagingen te tacklen?




Hoe kunnen we de massa aan data die we hebben, gebruiken om onze kredietverlening verder te sturen?
De wereldproblematiek rond natuur, milieu en klimaatverandering daagt iedereen uit. KBC is vastbesloten om een zeer belangrijke rol te spelen in de evolutie naar een duurzame wereld. Data over duurzaamheid zal een belangrijke schakel worden in de wereld van ondernemingskredieten
Complexiteit van kredieten aan zelfstandigen, KMO’s en large corporates zorgen voor een complexe data-wereld.




Wat verwachten we van jou?




Je analyseert complexe opdrachten of processen van verschillende business partijen.
Je vertaalt je analyse naar de juiste interne & externe data en programmeert dit ook in de daarvoor bestemde tools.
Je bouwt mee aan toepassingen die zullen worden gebruikt voor het capteren van nieuwe datapunten (o.a. over duurzaamheid) of voor het automatiseren van backend processen.




Jouw troeven?




Je hebt een masterdiploma in economie, wetenschappen, engineering of IT.
Data-analyse of werken met data is niet nieuw voor jou. Ervaring met SAS, Python, SQL of Qlik sense is een pluspunt.
Kennis van kredietverlening is geen must, maar het is wel belangrijk dat je interesse hebt in hoe bedrijfsfinanciering werkt.
Samen met je collega’s voor een doel gaan, dat motiveert je.
Je communiceert vlot in het Nederlands en het Engels. In beide talen breng je complexe materie helder over.

Expected starting date: September 2023




Type of contract: full-time one-year contract (renewable based on performance)

Bruegel welcomes applications for a Research Analyst (data quality control/management) position.




In addition to the usual tasks performed by a Bruegel RA, the successful candidate would play a specific – coordinating – role within the RA team helping Bruegel manage efficiently its databases and ensure data quality before publications.




Applicants not interested in applying for this specific role should apply to the general call for Research Assistants and Interns published simultaneously to this one.




Bruegel is a European think tank working in the field of international economics. Established in 2005, Bruegel is independent and non-doctrinal. Its mission is to improve the quality of economic policy with open and fact-based research, analysis and debate. We are committed to impartiality, openness and excellence. Bruegel’s membership includes EU Member State governments, international corporations and institutions. For more information about Bruegel, please consult: www.bruegel.org




KEY RESPONSIBILITIES 

The Research Analyst will be assisting Bruegel fellows in their research and in drafting Bruegel publications – like other Bruegel RAs – but will, in addition, devote a significant share of their time (around 50%, depending on needs) performing specific duties to optimise and ensure the quality of the other RAs’ work:

Build guidelines for RAs to homogenise how data is used in Bruegel’s projects: how to structure excel files, Stata, R and Python codes to make them comprehensible and replicable by third parties
Perform quality control to ensure rigorous standards of data replicability (i.e. flawless and well sourced data) before each Bruegel publication i.e. policy papers and blog posts
Manage data: centralisation of data repeatedly used in Bruegel’s projects after publication of papers to avoid duplication of work by RAs in future similar projects
Support other RAs in some specific tasks: coding in R/Python, data visualisation (also coordinating with Bruegel’s communication team), etc.




GENERAL REQUIREMENTS




Skills




All applicants must hold a Master’s degree or equivalent in Economics or related fields, should possess a solid understanding of economics and demonstrate technical strength in quantitative economic methods/econometrics.




Strong proficiency in all the main data software used by Bruegel (Python, R, Stata and Excel) is required. Data scraping and data visualisation skills (using e.g. plotly and dash packages in Python, or java script) will be highly valued for this specific position.




Applicants must also be fluent in English, both written and spoken.




Applicants are expected to be able to confidently, autonomously and professionally communicate with Bruegel colleagues and possibly with relevant stakeholders. Versatility, attention to detail, and the ability to work as a team-player with short deadlines are desired.




Interests




Applicants must have an interest in applied, policy-oriented research in Bruegel’s areas of specialisation, including the functioning of EU policies. Bruegel research areas include: innovation and competition policy, digital economy, climate and energy policy, macroeconomic policy, trade policy, banking, capital markets and financial regulation.




In addition, for this specific RA position, applicants must also have a very strong interest in coding, data management, and data visualisation.




Experience




Besides a Master’s degree – or equivalent – in Economics, candidates for this specific Research Assistant position should possess at least one year of professional experience in economic empirical work as well as in managing or coordinating data projects.




APPLICATION PROCEDURE




To apply, please submit your application to recruitment@bruegel.org with the subject line: “Research




Assistant Data Application 2023”, by 3 March 2023, 00:00 CET.




The email must contain: CV, Cover Letter, Writing Sample (such as Master’s thesis), University Transcripts.




Applications with missing documents and/or that do not meet the above-mentioned requirements will NOT be considered.




Because of the high number of applications we usually receive we are unfortunately unable to reply to all applicants. Only shortlisted applicants will be contacted within a few weeks.




Bruegel is committed to ensuring equal opportunities and treatment for all by providing that no job applicant receives less favourable treatment on the grounds of race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, gender, marital status, caring responsibilities, sexual orientation, disability or chronic illness.

Transport & Environment (T&E), the leading Brussels-based NGO promoting cleaner transport in Europe, is offering an internship position for a period of one year, starting in February 2021.




The successful candidate will be working with T&E's Trends and Analysis team, supporting T&E’s in-house quantitative analysis on Aviation and Shipping.




The successful candidate will have a strong foundation in programming (Python is a plus) and ideally have some knowledge of transport modelling, large data management and visualisation, an interest in environmental conservation and an aptitude for developing policy recommendations that would lead to positive environmental outcomes. Good interpersonal skills are essential as is a good level of English (the working language). Candidates should be able to work autonomously and collaboratively.




Candidates with an engineering or economics background are strongly encouraged to apply, though anyone with relevant skills and interest will be considered.




What will you do

As part of the internship, the successful candidate will undertake one or several specific research projects with the exact scope of the project to be agreed at commencement. The projects would be dependent on the skill set and experience of the person. Some examples of potential projects are:




Analysis of European shipping emissions. This will entail an optimisation of T&E’s in-house Python program to calculate ship GHG emissions, validation of its outputs against real-world reported emissions and setup of a ship emissions database for T&E’s advocacy and campaigning work.




Analytic support to our Travel Smart campaign and development of T&E’s database tracking business travel reduction commitments of companies over the world.




Data collection and research on various work streams of the Aviation and Shipping teams (aviation demand, LNG use in shipping, national data, etc.)




In addition, the selected person would also help with other projects within the team to gain a more fulfilling experience in working in the organisation.




What do we offer

The position is full-time, with a contract running from early February 2023 to early February 2024, although the dates are subject to discussion. The internship is paid according to the Belgian legal framework of “Convention d’Immersion Professionnelle” (remunerated with approximately €1400 net a month). T&E is an equal opportunities employer.




The deadline for applications is midnight 5th of February, and interviews will take place in the week of 13nd of February.




How to apply

Applications should be sent by email to vacancy@transportenvironment.org with the application form (downloadable below), cover letter and CV, all within one document and in the following order: application form, cover letter and CV. Please name the file as follows: Firstname_Lastname_TAAS2023_intern. Also, please ensure the title of the job vacancy is shown in the subject line of your email.




The cover letter, of one page maximum, and completed application form should explain the motivation and commitment to work with Transport & Environment’s aims, and also highlight examples from your previous work or studies that show us that you have the skills and competencies outlined above.




Transport & Environment offers great flexibility in work schedule and modality. However, preference will be given to candidates able to come work regularly on site in Brussels.




We thank all candidates for their interest; however, we are only able to contact those who have been shortlisted. Only applicants with the existing right to work within the EU will be considered.

About CaptureAge

CaptureAge is a company that grew out of the Age II community and we are now partnered with World's Edge to develop spectating tools and provide game development services in both Age II and Age IV. We are looking for people to join us who share our passion for one or both of these titles.

Hours / Time Management

We have a flexible approach to time-management and we believe in giving team members the opportunity to control their own schedules.

In practice this generally means a few pre-agreed sync points a week, with the rest of your working time entirely up to you.

Async Biased

As a company spanning many time zones we naturally tend towards async working arrangements and design our processes and working environment with this in mind.

Consensus Driven

We try to foster a genuinely collaborative and consensus driven approach to work rather than top-down direction and micro-management.

We bring data scientists and engineers with deep technical expertise together with marketeers, growth hackers, and marketing automation experts from our sister companies of the Customer Collective.

Together we bridge the entire value chain: we make sure we create value with intelligent use of customer data: from organizing the data to executing marketing campaigns and measuring incremental revenues.

Our customers want to use data science in their marketing and sales operations, and we support them by all means. Our drive is to create impact with quantitative solutions.




After the onboarding, you will start working on one or more client projects. Our clients have clear ambitions to become heroes in their fields by adapting data science in their marketing and sales. You will be in a hybrid team that consists of other data scientists, data engineers, and marketers. You will also be assigned a Career Advisor, someone from our Leadership team who will closely mentor and coach you during these first years of your career. This role will boost your career, and it will allow you to learn fast and build expertise in the Data Engineering field. You will further develop your consulting skills by running end-to-end processes. You will learn from some of the most engaging experts in the industry and get extensive training on technical matters and soft skills, and project management. Most importantly, you will have an immediate and visible impact on the business.

Over time, you can pursue different career tracks, becoming a data engineering expert, data scientist or project manager, or account manager. Next, you can grow towards more growth hacking or even more towards marketing within our Customer collective group.

 




As a Data Engineer, you will design and develop data solutions and be responsible for making them run resiliently in diverse computing environments (Azure / AWS / on prem). You will also have to manage their build and delivery lifecycles (build scripts, deploy scripts, monitor setup).

 

We're looking for hands-on thinkers with an open DevOps mindset that can contribute to the design of the IT solution at all levels of granularity and get their hands on the keyboard to get it done, tested, shipped, and running.

 

More concretely, you will:

 

Design and write data computing components along with their required storage layers
Define the data flows and data requirements to serve our analytic and operational use cases
Operate our data solutions on real user data in production
Provide deep technical support, guidance, and advice to a diverse team of great individuals
Become part of our DataOps practice participating in everyone's growth

 

Skills required:

have a EU work permit, willing to live in Belgium
You have experience designing and coding a data processing solution and shipping it to production. Our clients work primarily with MS Azure, AWS, Snowflake, Python, SQL.
As our solutions are data science driven, you have notions of data science and have strong analytical skills.
You are used to work in agile teams and you are a real team player
You are fluent in English and have a solid technical academic background.




 

Our Offer

 

The opportunity to shape your analytical career and to grow as rapidly as we do. You will get a personal training budget that you may spend however you like, as long as it honors your skills.
On-project coaching by one of our experts.
Challenging and fun projects for the most influential brands and companies out there.
A mixture of working on team projects and individual expert projects. Sometimes your office will be at the client on-site (Antwerp, Brussels, or Ghent in most cases), and other times you will work at home or in the offices in Diegem, Mechelen, Antwerp, or Genk. We will also consider international, full remote candidates.
An extensive salary package, supplemented by a whole series of fringe benefits such as net expense allowances, meal vouchers, mobile phone subscription, etc.
A very nice company car with a fuel card or a flex package if that fits you better.

Werken bij Korian betekent veel meer dan werken in de zorg. Bij Korian draag je dagelijks je steentje bij aan het welbevinden en de levenskwaliteit van ouderen en kwetsbare mensen, waar je ook werkt: in één van onze woonzorgcentra, in de thuiszorg, of op het hoofdkantoor.




‘In Caring Hands’ is het hart van onze organisatie, de missie van ons allen, waar ieder van ons zich dag in en dag uit voor inzet. ‘In Caring Hands’ geldt niet alleen voor onze bewoners of cliënten. Bij Korian dragen we graag ‘zorg voor hen die zorg dragen’. Het welbevinden van onze medewerkers staat voorop. Gelukkige medewerkers zorgen voor gelukkige bewoners en cliënten. En dat is tenslotte waar het om draait!




Functieomschrijving




Bij Korian werken we het liefst data-gedreven aan innovaties. Ook vinden we het belangrijk dat alle data goed beschikbaar is zodat onze collega’s de beste inzichten krijgen. De verantwoordelijkheid van ‘jouw’ team is dan ook om de data logisch weer te geven.




Als Data Engineer speel je een sleutelrol in het structureren en verwerken van al onze data. Daarnaast voer je analyses uit om tot strategische inzichten te komen en onze business te helpen met deze informatie. Deze tweedeling maakt je werk uitdagend en gevarieerd.




Het Data & Analytics team is een technisch team op een waardevolle plek binnen de organisatie. Je staat goed in contact met de business teams van Korian Benelux, en zult hier een verbindende rol spelen door op een voor iedereen begrijpelijke manier met data onderwerpen aan de slag te gaan.

Hierin krijg je een zelfstandige functie met veel ruimte voor eigen initiatief, en een plek waar je jezelf volop kunt ontwikkelen. En niet onbelangrijk; de waardering voor jouw werk is hier sky-high.




Een aantal concrete voorbeelden uit jouw takenpakket:

Het bouwen aan- en onderhouden van het Enterprise data platform: binnenhalen, transformeren, structureren;
Inzichten verkrijgen uit grote hoeveelheden data;
Verkregen data omzetten tot begrijpelijke informatie samen met de BI specialist en data analist;
Je gaat aan de slag met data modelleringen;
Schakelen met de business teams binnen Korian om hen te voorzien van de juiste informatie;
Het bijdragen aan de ontwikkeling van onze data strategie

De snelle groei in de Data & Analytics afdeling van Korian betekent dat de organisatie verder ontwikkeld moet worden. Dit brengt veel kansen, zoals dat je bijvoorbeeld een sterkte invloed hebt op de data strategie en werkwijzen, maar dit betekent ook dat er nog geen strak plan klaarligt van waaruit jij uit de startblokken kunt.




Profiel




Dit is wel iets voor jou wanneer…

je houdt van pionieren
je ziet mogelijkheden in het ontwikkelen van een Data & Analytics organisatie
je graag aan de slag gaat met het maken van data pipelines en datasets
je het niet erg vindt wanneer de regels nog niet vastliggen; deze kun je dan zelf immers mee bepalen.

Dit is niet iets voor jou wanneer je…

liever landt in een strak georganiseerd team
niet van koerswijzigingen houdt

Jij bent succesvol binnen Korian wanneer je als teamplayer zelfstandig en proactief te werk gaat. Dit zal betekenen dat je jezelf soms terugtrekt om aan complexe analyses te werken, en soms met interne stakeholders op zoek gaat naar technische oplossingen.

Je bent enthousiast om jouw ervaring en passie voor data in te zetten om het Data & Analytics team van Korian verder te ontwikkelen.




Hiervoor vragen we het volgende:

Een passie voor data
Bachelor of master ICT, toegepaste wiskunde, ingenieur ICT of gelijkwaardig
Je hebt kennis van data modellering (ERD modellen, conceptuele datamodellen)
Je hebt bewezen ervaring in MS Azure, Synapse, Data factory, MSSQL
Je werkt nauwgezet en gestructureerd, en documenteert je werk zorgvuldig
Je hebt al een eerste werkervaring in de data wereld achter de rug
Je hebt een goede kennis van Nederlands en Frans en je spreekt ook wel een aardig mondje Engels
Goede communicatieve vaardigheden







Wij bieden




Bij Korian willen we niet zomaar een werkgever zijn. Het is ons engagement om het beste in onze mensen naar boven te brengen.




Hoe we dat doen?

Je maakt onderdeel uit van een enthousiast en betrokken team binnen een snelgroeiende, gezonde internationale beursgenoteerde organisatie.
We vinden de ontwikkeling van onze medewerkers belangrijk en investeren daarom in een opleidingstraject op maat. Hieronder vallen data-specifieke trainingen, aangeboden door de Korian Groep.
Verder bieden we de mogelijkheid tot flexibel werken, bijvoorbeeld vanuit onze hoofdkantoren, locaties of vanuit thuis.
En last but not least, voor deze job is er een marktconform salaris aangevuld met extra legale voordelen, waaronder een laptop, telefoonvergoeding, ecocheques en een groepsverzekering, hospitalisatieverzekering, maaltijdcheques, bedrijfswagen met tankkaart.

Voorziene startdatum: Januari 2023




We moedigen alle mensen aan om hun kandidatuur in te dienen ongeacht hun afkomst, huidskleur, geslacht, leeftijd, seksuele geaardheid, filosofische overtuiging, handicap, ...




Indien je aangepaste accommodatie nodig hebt, wat jouw handicap ook is, voor de selectiefase voor deze functie of daarna, aarzel dan niet om contact met ons op te nemen.

The Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine at Mass General for Children is seeking a Data Analyst to provide analytic support for research activities on a National Institutes of Health R01-funded R01 project. Specifically, the Data Analyst will work with a national team of investigators on a study that aims to provide a national view of opioid use disorder care for Medicaid-enrolled youth, with an emphasis on identifying disparities by race and ethnicity. The Data Analyst will lead a comprehensive analysis of youth aged 13-25 using the newly released Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System Analytic Files (TAF), which include inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, and pharmacy claims from across the US from 2016-2021 from the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

The Data Analyst may also be asked to assist in conducting literature reviews, developing grant proposals, and developing presentations and manuscripts for the dissemination of findings.




Skills/Abilities/Competencies Required




The ideal candidate will have achieved strong performance in masters-level statistics courses, with demonstrated strong analytic ability (including at least some experience working in SAS, Stata, R, Python, or similar programming languages). This position requires attention to detail, especially in ensuring data quality and accuracy. The ability to work simultaneously on various tasks, to maintain attention to detail, and to effectively contribute to the project team are also essential.

Agency Mission




The mission of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) is to prevent illness, injury, and premature death, to assure access to high-quality public health and healthcare services, and to promote wellness and health equity for all people in the Commonwealth.




We envision a Commonwealth in which all people enjoy optimal health. Massachusetts ranks among the healthiest of states according to comparative analyses, but we face numerous challenges, including inequities in chronic and infectious disease, substance abuse, violence, and preventable hospitalizations.




DPH coordinates programs and policies to address specific diseases and conditions and offers services to address the needs of vulnerable populations. We also develop, implement, promote, and enforce regulations and policies to ensure that the conditions under which people live are most conducive to health and enable people to make healthy choices for themselves and their families. We license health professionals, healthcare facilities, and a variety of businesses that impact public health. We operate the state laboratory and four public health hospitals. We monitor health status and manage vital records including births, marriages, and deaths. We educate people about public health issues and work closely with local boards of health and community partners to identify and solve public health problems.

NewGlobe supports visionary governments to transform public education systems, the cornerstone of a prosperous, equitable, and peaceful society.




With a comprehensive system transformation platform and data-driven educational services, NewGlobe delivers rapid and dramatic improvements in learning outcomes at state and nationwide scale. Through building impactful partnerships and programmes, NewGlobe ensures that all children have access to an education that will develop their full potential and create a foundation for growth and prosperity.




NewGlobe leverages more than a decade of educational experience and proven impact in integrated school management, teacher professional development, instructional design innovation, technological system support, child-centered classroom practice, and parent engagement -- all grounded in learning science -- to ensure each teacher is empowered to engage children in transformational learning, and all children have the opportunity to develop to their full potential. Every day, NewGlobe supports governments to solve what were once seen as intractable problems, and by doing so, ensures this generation will be able to grow up to lead more fulfilled lives, while simultaneously building economic prosperity for themselves, their communities, and the globe.




NewGlobe’s high-touch, intensive professional development programs, along with integrated school management, teacher support, and assessment software, enable schools to succeed. NewGlobe works within state and national curriculum and syllabi, ensuring all children are empowered to learn their own history, and master local content, while being globally competitive in mathematics and languages. The science of behaviour change and the science of learning is at the foundation of all programming.




NewGlobe works with urgency because youth quickly becomes adulthood and relentlessly because improvement requires continuous problem-solving. NewGlobe is honoured to serve and to help rebuild trust in public systems.




NewGlobe’s work is all encompassing and will challenge you to use your full mind, and heart, each day. We need bright minds who want to be part of building a new globe -- a more equitable globe -- to join us.




Academics




The objective of the Academics group is to drive student achievement. To do so, we must know what is happening minute-by-minute for the typical child. The student’s daily experience, and thus the path to achievement, emerges from their relationship with the teachers and the content that is delivered in the classroom. Our team is collaboratively organized around these levers. We develop rigorous content pitched at the right level for students to be delivered by a teacher who is prepared to succeed in the classroom. Our Instructional Design department builds the content; our Leadership & Development department trains teachers and school leaders using scientifically-proven techniques; our Learning Innovation department looks at cutting-edge research to generate breakthrough learning gains. Underpinning all of this is the work of the independent Measurement and Evaluation group, which provides Academics with an empirical orientation toward improving that daily experience and, in turn, driving achievement.




Measurement & Evaluation




The Measurement & Evaluation team at NewGlobe is housed within the Academics group and collaborates across departments to help leaders assess the quality of teaching and learning at NewGlobe. We work to answer the core questions of “How well are we doing?”, “Are we getting better?”, and “How can we get even better?”. We blend quantitative analyses with qualitative field work to measure what matters most, provide feedback to NewGlobe school leaders and managers, assess our impact on student learning, and communicate the results to various internal and external audiences.




At the heart of our work is comparative analysis. We compare student learning at NewGlobe across time and place. In all of our locations, we examine how much faster NewGlobe students learn than their peers in similar schools. We examine how student performance today compares to student performance yesterday. We examine sub-groups of students to advance equity. We examine variability across our schools to determine which characteristics matter most to student learning. We help NewGlobe managers assess the impact of the changes they have made to accelerate learning.




We take pride in providing rigorous measurement, study design, and analysis. We also take pride in our ability to communicate clearly in words, tables, and data visualizations. We intend our work to make a difference in how NewGlobe managers and our government partners think and act. We judge our own work accordingly.




Collaboration sits at the heart of M&E at NewGlobe. We collaborate with our internal team members as well as with our government partners. With every product, we enter into a collaborative conversation with those who operate and those who study. M&E has established deep partnerships with the education ministries, with local research organizations, and with international researchers who focus on teaching and learning, especially those who focus on the aspects of schooling most relevant to the students we serve.




About The Role




We are seeking a full-time M&E Data Analyst to join our team. We are looking for someone eager to conduct impactful research, share their expertise, and build upon a tradition of evaluation and data excellence at NewGlobe.




The Data Analyst is responsible for supporting the data analysis of different descriptive analyses and impact evaluations within the organization. These analyses can range from simple descriptive analyses using a few Excel formulas, to more complex work using multiple Stata or R scripts. To do this, the Analyst will need to manage all parts of the data analysis process - starting from the design stage through the execution of analyses, and the reporting of the findings to other internal stakeholders.




The analyst is responsible for the provision of high-quality data products that other colleagues can rely on, and build their own work on. As such, this role is at the core of a large portion of all the M&E efforts within NewGlobe, and in consequence, at the intersection of our evaluation efforts to continually deliver stronger education to our students. We view data and analytics as core to our ability to learn as an organization. We want to cultivate data and analytics rock stars, people who produce and use data to reveal actionable insights for NewGlobe’s rapidly growing network of schools. The person in this role will receive constant coaching and mentoring from the rest of the M&E and Data Analytics team, and professional development will be a core feature of this role.




The M&E Analyst should be willing to work in Cambridge, MA. The M&E Analyst will report to the Director, M&E. Significant travel is required.




What You Will Do




Clean and analyze data sets. These data sets can be used to answer questions from a wide range of topics like academic performance, impact evaluation studies, internal RCTs, among others.
Ensure the creation of proper data pipelines and best data management practices.
Contribute to a culture of data-driven decision-making by collaborating with various team members across territories.
Accommodate requests for quick analyses. Time-sensitive questions will come from the VPs and C-Level Executives, and usually take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Oftentimes, you will need to direct your staff to use their best judgment in the face of imperfect data.
Other duties as required by the Directors and VP of M&E, and C-level executives.
What You Should Have




High data literacy and a strong background in econometrics and/or statistics. Previous experience in an academic or applied setting, such as being an analyst, research assistant, data manager, or consultant. Experience in data cleaning, analysis, and/or visualization.
A high level of proficiency with Stata or R, and Excel. Any other data analysis software or coding language is a plus. Experience with survey software like Qualtrics, SurveyCTO, or Google Forms is also a plus.
Undergraduate degree (or its equivalent) or Masters degree – in a relevant academic discipline, for example (but not limited to) Economics, Public or Education Policy, or Statistics.
Strong communication skills and the ability to translate complex ideas for non-technical audiences – you will need effective verbal and written communication skills to provide valuable insights and research reports for internal and external stakeholders.
Belief in data-driven decision making.
Flexible and loves to work in a dynamic environment.
Passion – for NewGlobe’s mission.
Bonus – experience in extreme growth situations and dealing with complexity; worked/studied in a developing country, worked in a no-excuses charter school in high-poverty areas in the U.S., and/or experience implementing data collection projects, particularly for impact evaluations.
You’re also




A detailed doer – You have a track record of getting things done. You’re organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company.
A networking mastermind – You excel at meeting new people and turning them into advocates. You communicate in a clear, conscientious, and effective way in both written and oral speech. You can influence strangers in the course of a single conversation. Allies and colleagues will go to bat for your ideas. You have an existing network from prior experience in the country, preferably in the regulatory, education, or business sectors.
A creative problem-solver – Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, NewGlobe works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand.
A relentless advocate –The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent’s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience, and value.
A malleable learner –You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you’ve missed things or failed today.
A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don’t just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.

Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience, and value. </li><li>A malleable learner –You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you’ve missed things or failed today. </li><li>A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don’t just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.</li></ul>

You will work directly with a portfolio of customers to understand their evolving competitive landscape, and research and deliver valuable insights. To do this, you are attentive to details, ask questions, and dig for answers. You are a self-starter drawn towards making things run more effectively. You understand that CS is a team sport and know what it takes to work with the team to identify opportunities to improve the product and customer experience and deliver value.

About the Role:

You will become an expert in Crayon’s platform and define digital footprints for companies. In collaboration with others on the team, you will work to uphold the delivery of high-quality and accurate information to all of our customers.
Understand customers' competitive landscape and research and deliver competitive insights reports aligned to customers' goals and interests.
Provide competitor tracking recommendations based on customers' evolving CI strategies and competitive landscape.
Collaborate with others on your team, and work to understand and resolve customer questions and issues.
In partnership with both your customers and fellow team members, identify opportunities to promote value and improve the customer experience.
Work with product and engineering to automate processes and brainstorm ways to make Crayon’s products more valuable to customers. Sometimes small ideas can turn into big ones!
This is an entry-level role in the Customer Success department and provides a ton of learning and growth opportunities for highly motivated individuals.


About You:

High Wattage. Did we already say smart? You love a good challenge and learning new skills, technology, and more.
Team Player. Emotional intelligence is a must. You enjoy working in a team environment, supporting your teammates in pursuit of our common goals, and working with your colleagues to drive customer value. You strive to not only improve yourself but also those around you.
Get S*** Done. You’re motivated and dedicated, have excellent time management skills, and pay attention to the details. You don’t shy away from hard work – in fact, you embrace it.
Research Background. You’re not scared of research, nor are you intimidated by data. In fact, you love spotting trends and telling a story.
Technical. We’re a software company so you should be energized by a technical environment. You’re generally quick at learning and mastering new technologies and programs. No matter what your background is, everyone starts off learning all (and we mean all) the basics of our systems.
Marketing Chops. You understand how marketing teams operate and you're able (or willing to learn how) to provide insights and recommendations to customers in both marketing and sales.
You Love Customers. Customers aren’t for everyone… sometimes they don’t understand what you mean, and sometimes they need extra help. You’re energized by the challenge of serving customers at a high level with all the work that you do.


Requirements

We are accepting only New England-based candidates at this time. While this is a remote role, there will be two to three mandatory onsite meetings per year. For those interested in a hybrid environment, our office is located close to South Station, in the Fort Point District in Boston, MA.

UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem-solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.




UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty.




POSITION PURPOSE




The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington. Its mission is to deliver to the world timely, relevant, and scientifically valid evidence to improve health policy and practice. IHME carries out its mission through a range of projects within different research areas including the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Future Health Scenarios; Cost Effectiveness and Efficiency; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. Our vision is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base so all people live long lives in full health.




IHME is committed to providing the evidence base necessary to help solve the world’s most important health problems. This requires creativity and innovation, which are cultivated by an inclusive, diverse, and equitable environment that respects and appreciates differences, embraces collaboration, and invites the voices of all IHME team members.




IHME has an outstanding opportunity for a Data Analyst on our Tobacco Metrics team, supporting the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD). A systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time, the GBD is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. The GBD’s aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health. The Surge Team supports research teams through temporary assignments to help meet deadlines, manage unexpected challenges or changes in scope, and fill in where staffing has fallen short.




The main purpose of the Data Analyst position is to provide support to the GBD Tobacco team’s research projects through database management, data quality management, computational support to multidisciplinary research projects, data extraction and formatting, and providing key inputs for papers and presentations. Data Analysts must develop an understanding of different research needs and analytic functions across multiple projects to best meet research needs. Data Analysts must be able to independently translate requests into actionable results through interactions with research databases, formulation of displays of results, and development of complex code to be applied to a variety of quantitative data.




This position calls for dexterity working with complex databases and the ability to assess, transform, and utilize quantitative data using multiple coding languages (R, Python, SQL, Stata). The individual must then quality control results to ensure that other team members have exactly what they need to incorporate the data and results into their own components of the analytic process, presentations, and papers. Additionally, this position will work alongside other Data Analysts on complementary projects and will require knowledge and skill sharing and collective problem solving. Overall, the Data Analyst will be a critical member of an agile, dynamic team. This position is contingent on project funding availability.




Duties And Responsibilities




Research command




Become familiar with substantive areas of expertise to understand the dimensions and uses of health data and the analytic underpinnings of different research streams.
Work directly with researchers to identify the source of data used in models and results, understand the context of the data, and ensure that they are relevant to the analyses themselves.
Create and document efficient, effective, and replicable methods for extracting data, developing code, organizing data sources, managing data quality, and explaining complex analytic processes.




Data management and analytics




Problem-solve computational and analytic challenges by investigating the data, understanding the root questions, and coming up with alternative measurement strategies.
Implement code solutions in order to answer analytic questions, perform diagnostics on results, and test and assess new methods.
Maintain, update, and adapt databases containing health data from multiple sources such as surveys, vital registration systems, administrative records, and published studies relevant to demographic estimation.
Maintain, update, and carry out routine but complex computational processes and statistical modeling that are central to generating estimates of key indicators.
Execute queries on databases and resolve intricate questions in order to respond to the needs of senior researchers and external requests from collaborators, media, policymakers, donors, and other stakeholders.
Bring together data, analytic engines, and data visualizations in one seamless computational process.
Use protocols to identify problems with datasets and routine computational processes, rectify issues, and systematize data for future analyses.
Transform and format datasets for use in ongoing analyses. Catalog and incorporate these datasets into databases. Perform quality checks.




General




Create tables, figures, and charts for presentations and publications.
Provide referencing and other support for publications and presentations.
Communicate clearly and effectively while contributing as a member of the Institute.
Work closely with other team members to assist with relevant tasks, facilitate learning new skills, and help resolve emerging problems on different projects.
Participate in overall community of the Institute, carrying out duties as required as team members with other Institute members.




Minimum Requirements




Bachelor’s degree in social sciences, engineering, computer science, or related field plus two years’ related experience, or equivalent combination of education and experience.




Additional Requirements




Demonstrated success in developing code in Stata and R.
Interest in global health, population health, and/or ways in which quantitative research and data science can be used to create valuable global public goods.
Demonstrated self-motivation, ability to absorb detailed information, flexibility, and ability to thrive in a fast-paced, energetic, highly creative, and entrepreneurial environment.
Ability to learn new information quickly and apply analytic skills to better understand complex information in a systematic way.
Strong quantitative aptitude.
Flexible attitude and interest in moving around to a variety of different research teams, getting a broader range of experience, rather than focusing on a particular research area or team.
A commitment to working alongside others at IHME to illuminate the health impacts of systemic racism and to work within IHME to make our organization more diverse and inclusive. See IHME’s DEI statement here: https://www.healthdata.org/about/mission-vision/DEI [healthdata.org].




Desired Qualifications




Demonstrated success in developing code in Python.
