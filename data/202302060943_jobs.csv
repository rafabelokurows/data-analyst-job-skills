THE COMPANY




B-Stock is the world's largest B2B recommerce marketplace for excess [or surplus] merchandise. Businesses of all sizes leverage the B-Stock platform to sell and buy customer returns, overstock and other excess merchandise - ranging from top brands and retailers who want best-in-class inventory management to entrepreneurs looking to source valuable merchandise for their resale businesses.




Tens of thousands of small business owners all over the globe use B-Stock to launch and power their resale business. We take pride in empowering these innovators and entrepreneurs of commerce.




In 2020 we sold 120 million items across our platform, giving a second life to this otherwise would be “waste” merchandise. In fact, we kept 400 million pounds of goods in use and saved millions from the landfill. It feels good to be B-Stock!




The amount of returned or unsold inventory continues to grow each year, and in 2020, it was estimated at over $1 trillion worth worldwide. We know there is tremendous value in and demand for this inventory - no matter the category, condition, or location. The B-Stock platform gives buyers a simple way to buy brand-name merchandise directly from top retailers and manufacturers. At the same time, we offer companies an automated, trusted replacement for traditional liquidation while boosting operational efficiency, recovery rates, and cycle time.




Led by eBay veterans and backed by top investors including Spectrum Equity, True Ventures, and Susquehanna Growth Equity, B-Stock shows no signs of slowing down. Our core values have shaped the company we are today and will continue to drive our success for many years to come.

OUR VALUES




Make Each Dollar Count

Whether it’s the recovery amount or a buyer’s budget, money matters to all of our clients. And because each dollar matters to them, it matters to us.




Take Our Work Seriously, Not Ourselves

Everything at B-Stock continues to grow - everything but our egos, that is. We’re not afraid to let loose and laugh (often at ourselves).




Do The Hard Things Today That Will Pay Off Tomorrow

We’re willing to sacrifice and endure, fail and adapt to reach our long-term goals.




Use Trust As The Best Measure Of Success

The trust we earn along the way is more valuable than money. Without trust from both our buyers and sellers, our business won’t succeed.




Find Strength In Numbers

Use our passion for data to provide value to our customers, improve ourselves, and develop new ways to delight our buyers and sellers.










No applicant will face discrimination/harassment based on race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, or veteran status. Above and beyond discrimination/harassment based on “protected categories,” B-Stock also strives to prevent other, subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (e.g., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at B-Stock.




Work Authorization required.

So are our people. We’re a small team, but we’ve got a big vision: to build a brand-new infrastructure for operational risk management. It’s not easy. We’re redefining the way some of the world’s biggest financial services companies and banks work with data. There are a lot of challenges – but a lot of opportunities to think and act creatively, too.

Backed by banks (JP Morgan, Citi, Barclays, Lloyds, BNP) and ratings agencies, Acin helps banks objectively manage their risk control landscape. Based on a network of peers, Acin’s data protocols connect a bank’s risk control data across their firm and industry leading to greater cost savings, and creating huge efficiency savings across the bank both in front and back-office operations.

The role:

The Data Analyst role within the Data Operations team is instrumental in delivering value to our customers. In this role you will connect customer data to the Acin Network, assisted by senior colleagues and while building a good knowledge of what’s important in a risk and control framework.

About Black Sheep Coffee…




Founded in 2013 when a group of friends decided to quit their jobs on the same day to “Leave The Herd Behind” and embark on a coffee mission of ridding the world of boring, average-tasting coffee. Black Sheep Coffee is famous for launching the first 100% specialty grade robusta coffee and the only premium robusta bean on the market (X2 caffeine – get your buzz on!). Our Founders, Gabriel and Eirik, travel to origins throughout the year to source the best beans in the world.

Y TREE is a rapidly growing FinTech that is re-defining how individuals and families connect and engage with their money. We aim to make personal finance transparent, efficient and meaningful so that our understanding of wealth is re-defined to how we live, not what we own.

Team Overview

Maintaining accurate and up to date data is central to our business, and underpins everything we do for our clients. The Client Data Team is integral to our ability to maintain this data which is used to produce the analysis and in turn, the financial advice at the core of Y TREE.

The Role

To enable us to provide the analysis on their finances, clients entrust us with their confidential and sensitive financial statements accounting for their balance, income, cash flow, and equities. A core responsibility in this role will be to take those statements and ensure the correct data is transferred to our back office system.
You will carry out work for both prospect clients and those who are existing clients for the firm; your work will be central to the trust they build with Y TREE.
As part of the role, you will have the opportunity to work closely with both the Client Onboarding Team and Financial Life Strategy Team to obtain a holistic understanding of the journey of the data you have handled.
This role is a junior level role, but offers you the opportunity to build an understanding of how a financial services firm operates, an understanding of the data we handle and exposure to a variety of departments that are integral to a firm like ours. We really believe in supporting our team grow and develop and see this role as a pathway to progression in a regulated, or non- regulated role.


Requirements

The Technical Part

We don't need you to have any related work history for this role, but we are looking for graduates who have obtained a degree in anything that requires you to work with large sets of data. For example, previous candidates in this role have held degrees in Economics, Maths, Physics and Chemistry.
We will need you to not just tolerate the mathematical element of your degree, but enjoy it. This role requires you to work with large number sets and we would prefer it if this is something you like doing!


The Person

We are much more interested in who you are. This role gives you access to incredibly sensitive client data, so we would like you to be mature and trustworthy in your approach.
The deeper you embed yourself in this role, the more value you can add to our team. For that reason we would like you to be somebody with an inquisitive mind and a thirst for learning- this role can be what you make of it and previous candidates are now obtaining professional qualifications and moving into our Client Adviser career pathway.
As an agile business, we often deliver projects in cross functional teams so we would like you to be warm and engaging, with the ability to build strong, well-rounded relationships.
We are not a big financial institution (yet!) so you will need to be solutions-led and have the impetus and ability to proactively seek answers if you get stuck.
We would like you to have a methodical and detail orientated approach to work- you will be working with data after all!
We work at pace; outcomes are time sensitive so we would like you to be somebody who performs well under pressure.
Our community is where our power lies, so you must be an effective collaborator and confident speaking up and working as part of a small team that is building a business.
We are driving innovation in our area of personal finance and our product is a reflection of our team. We would like for you to be somebody who is intelligent, an independent thinker and somebody who is eager to share ideas.
We operate a very flat heirachy in the business, so we would like you to leave your ego at the door. Those with a people-centred approach are best suited to us and our team.


Benefits

What's in it for you?

The ability to hone your skills and cultivate your craft in a genuinely outcome led, flexible, happy work environment. We have a hybrid working policy and the ability to flex your hours as you need. We are all adults, and we understand work needs to balance your personal life too.
25 days of annual leave per year. This is 25 days each year we expect you to turn your phone off and switch off; we would never ask you to book leave for a doctor's appointment or to see your children's school plays.
Regular team socials to help you switch off from work and get to know your colleagues in an environment away from your desk. We ensure socials are well balanced and offer a variety of activities to suit different needs so you always feel welcome.
A welcoming, dog-friendly London office with appropriate spaces to cater for those with varying needs in the form of various breakout spaces and silent booths.
Support for your mental and physical health in the form of online fitness classes and access to a gym group in London.
A 3% pension contribution to help you save for the future
Family friendly policies

Octopus Energy UK 🇬🇧 – Data /




Full-time




/ Hybrid







Help us make a big green dent in the universe. We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.




Octopus buys power directly from wind, solar and hydro sites all over the UK (and soon all over the world). This allows us to supply our customers with green electricity, straight from the source.




We’re looking for an Analyst to support us as we sign contracts to buy power from more and bigger renewable generators. This Analyst will lead on pricing, risk management and performance monitoring. This will all be done with a view to paying a fair price to renewable generators, and delivering green electricity to Octopus customers at the lowest possible cost.




The ideal candidate will have a passion for using data to enable the transition to renewable energy. And will be comfortable with all the moving parts and complexity that come with the energy industry.




This role will sit within the Octopus Energy Procurement team. However, this is not a typical Energy Procurement team. Instead of working in large, siloed teams, our trading, risk, forecasting and data science functions work closely together. We use technology to maintain a lean operation as the company grows. We focus on the big problems and give people the autonomy and resources to find innovative solutions.




What You'll Do




Create processes to track performance from contracting through to delivery, identifying areas for improvement.
Quantify and categorise risks in Octopus’s renewable energy origination processes.
Improve and maintain pricing tools, taking risks and historical performance into account.
Develop custom pricing proposals that are mutually beneficial to Octopus and renewable generators.
Work with the Forecasting Team to help Improve and maintain models for forecasting wind, solar and hydro generation at the level of the individual site.
Support the development of innovative commercial structures between Octopus's supply business and Octopus Energy GenerationDevelop alerting for generator outages or reduced performance.
Work with other teams at Octopus, including Strategy, Finance, Generation, Business, Hydrogen and many more.
Support Octopus businesses in other countries by sharing experience and best practices.




What You'll Need




Passion for renewables and the energy transition.
Desire to explore complex systems and an ability to learn fast.
Ability to communicate complicated concepts in a way that everyone can understand.
Commercial awareness and financial literacy to identify and understand the problems that need solving.
Comprehensive knowledge of data design, data modelling, data management and data visualisation.
Experience with a scripting language (ideally Python).Experience writing complex queries in SQL, analysing large datasets and building reports and dashboards.




If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.




Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.

Octopus Energy UK 🇬🇧 – Finance /




Full-time




/ Hybrid







Help us make a big green dent in the universe. We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.




We're looking for someone who will work in our credit risk function and develop our capabilities across both business and consumer portfolios.




This could not be a better time to join Octopus Energy. We are already recognised as a global leader in the fight to decarbonise the planet by revolutionising what’s possible in energy - including investments in renewable energy supply, renewable energy generation, smart energy networks, EVs, heat pumps, etc. The government's new green initiatives and the recent investment by Al Gore’s Generation Fund will propel us further and faster.




Equally, from a credit risk perspective this is an important time to join. The energy sector has gone through a period of volatility. Businesses and households are facing significantly higher energy prices just as we enter winter. This situation is compounded with the end of furlough and reductions to Universal Credit payments. For these reasons we are looking to add to our credit risk capabilities with this new role.




What You'll Do




Take ownership of our credit strategies for residential and business customers
Develop our credit scorecards
Payments and payment adequacy strategy
Collections insight and strategy
Develop our empathic approaches towards vulnerable customers
Credit risk reporting and management information
Strategies to identify and prevent first party and third party fraud
Bad debt provision and write-offs
Do all the above in partnership with Data Science, Finance, Collections, Ops and other stakeholders




What You'll Have




Excellent SQL skills
Python data science stack experience (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter notebooks, Plotly/matplotlib)
Git for version control experience
Data visualization tool experience (Tableau, Looker, PowerBI or equivalent)
Experience of consumer credit risk and collections is ideal but not essential
DBT experience a bonus but not essential




If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.




Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.

As a company of rational thinkers with big visions, our decisions—from the smallest app feature choices all the way up to the most dramatic strategic resolutions—must rest on robust foundations of truth. To make this happen, we’re looking for a brilliant, business-driven number-cruncher, savvy enough to run SQL queries and code their way around large amounts of data—someone who’s completely obsessed with data and finding (often counterintuitive) answers to complex, crucial questions.




A few examples of your responsibilities

Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.




What we look for

Logical-analytical abilities. You’re a quick learner who’s able to investigate and effectively pick up new concepts on your own. You can solve unforeseen challenges with creativity and structure, and can do so independently.
Relevant knowledge. You don’t need to be a walking encyclopedia on the topic, but you do need to know your ABCs from your XYZs. A solid and ever-expanding knowledge base is a prerequisite—you spend a hearty portion of your time seeking to fill in the gaps in your understanding.
Organization and structure. You’re meticulously organized and superbly structured, so you can handle multiple tasks and responsibilities with poise and precision.
Pragmatism. Far from being too academic or obsessive in your perfectionism, you understand that speed is often as important as quality when getting things done in a competitive world.
Curiosity and initiative. You love exploring, and are forever hunting down new opportunities and testing fresh ideas. Rather than waiting to be told what to do, you go seek.
Passion. You love what you do, and your enthusiasm never wavers with the specifics of a given task or team. Whether you’re on a plane, train, or sofa, odds are that you’ll be found with your nose in a book or article on the subject.
Drive. You’re energetic and hard-working, and you persevere through adversity until the job is done—and done impeccably. You’re massively into getting results, and always aim for excellence in what you do.
Communication skills. You can pose questions with clarity and explain your reasoning concisely.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.




What we offer

Lots. Of. Data. With millions of users, hundreds of thousands of new users every day, and a large, diverse, and ever-growing portfolio of products, Bending Spoons is the perfect playground for a data nerd (we know you are—we are too!).
The finest tools. You get the best hardware on the market and all the software you could need. We can't wait to introduce you to our high-tech approach and our cutting-edge workflows.
Talented, knowledgeable colleagues. Learn from (and teach) some of the brightest and most skilled people you’ll ever meet. Your talent is going to blossom here.
Make a difference. Be the owner of your effort—from day one, you’re one of the team and fully trusted to take responsibility for your tasks. You’ll have every incentive to make a major impact.
Unique career opportunity. By joining a fast-growing company on a mission to become one of the world's greatest, it’s an unparalleled opportunity to turbocharge your learning and career prospects.
Continuous education. Spooners get unlimited backing for learning investments, including Italian or English lessons and things like courses, conferences, and books. There’s no permission or approval process—you’re fully trusted to use the company’s resources efficiently.
Flexible schedule. Our regular hours are 9-6 GMT+1, but this isn’t a “clock in, clock out” company. You’re fully trusted to create the right conditions for your own personal peak productivity. We only ask that you’re available to your teammates a good chunk of the day (six hours or so). That’s why it’s generally best to be based somewhere with a similar time zone—between GMT-2 and GMT+3.
Unlimited time off. Take all the time you need to be with your family or just recharge your batteries. There’s no maximum number of days off, and there isn't any kind of permission process. We just ask that you make your vacation decisions mindfully.
Remote working. Spend as much or as little time in our Milan office as you choose. Many Spooners like to change up their environment and get out of the city whenever the mood strikes. You’ve always got the freedom to decide where today’s office is.
Competitive salary and stock options. Our compensation package is highly competitive, and can grow rapidly and include stock options, depending on your performance and seniority.




Commitment & contract

Full time or part-time. Permanent or fixed-term (depending on seniority).




Location

Milan, Italy or fully remote.

If you choose the on-site option, it’s also fine to sometimes work remotely. We offer substantial support for relocation, including finding an apartment in Milan and paying the rent for 12 weeks.




The selection process

If you successfully pass through our screening process, we’ll invite you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach and solve unfamiliar problems. These tests don’t require any prior knowledge, and they should take a few hours to complete. If you’re successful there, we’ll invite you to take part in some interviews—normally two or three—to get to know each other and figure out if it’s a good fit for both parties. The interviews are held remotely, and include some behavioral and problem-solving questions. To limit human bias, all of our hiring decisions are made by a hiring committee rather than any individual.




Spooners come from all over the world and English is our working language. We welcome applications in English or Italian—whichever suits you best!




All interviews and assessments take place in English and are held online.




Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment all applicants, regardless of their race, religion, color, ancestry, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, pregnancy, political affiliation, disability, and any other legally protected characteristic. We’re committed to providing reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities in our recruiting process. If you need any assistance or accommodations, please let us know at accommodations-ext@bendingspoons.com.

Zilch, the world’s first Commerce Card, is a UK-headquartered payments technology company, known for creating the Googlisation of Payments. Our mission is to create the best and most empowering way to pay, for anything, anywhere our customers want to spend. Using Zilch’s virtual Mastercard that sits in a customer’s digital wallet, Zilch combines the best of debit, credit and savings. Meaning our customers can either earn rewards on debit payments in the form of instant cashback (‘Pay in 1’) or spread interest-free repayments over six weeks (‘Pay in 4’), bringing them financial choice and maturing their credit profiles.




This is uniquely made possible by the proprietary Ad-Subsidised Payment Network (ASPN) that Zilch has built, which in cookieless world enables merchants around the world to connect directly with the millions of Zilch customers they otherwise couldn’t reach and offer them savings, deals and discounts.




By vertically integrating with consumers, rather than with merchants, Zilch allows customers to pay using either reward-earning debit or interest-free credit, both online and in-store, anywhere Mastercard is accepted. To ensure we are helping our customers to manage their cash flow responsibly when they make credit payments, we set dynamic borrowing limits using best-in-market data from leading credit reference agencies, open banking technology and behavioural data analysis. Together these generate a real-time, comprehensive, 360-degree view of a customer’s affordability profile, allowing us to set personalised borrowing limits accordingly. To further bolster our customer safeguards, we are fully regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, having obtained a consumer credit license prior to our launch.




Since launching as an FCA regulated business in the UK in September 2020 and in the US in May 2022, Zilch has amassed over 3 million customers in 24 months and turned gross profitable – years faster than other well-known fintechs. In that time, we have provided our customers with over £80 million in aggregate rewards and savings on fees and interest. Zilch is Europe’s fastest-ever company to go from Series A to double-unicorn status, in just 14 months, after raising capital at a $2bn valuation in November 2021 and maintaining that valuation in a subsequent equity funding round in Summer 2022.




We’re looking for….

An analyst keen to be part of a collaborative team who is passionate about the data domain
Someone who looks for opportunities to improve process and support stakeholders
An enthusiastic data person with attention to detail who sets a high standard for themselves
A champion of metrics and the measurement of impact, with the inquisitive acumen to explain the “Why”, not just the “What”
Someone with a thorough approach to model and report building who can identify solutions that meet business needs




Day-to-day responsibilities will include:

Working alongside data scientists, data analysts, data engineers and analytics engineers
Supporting business requirements for model and report building
Enhancing and optimising existing models and visualisations
Assisting with ad-hoc development and data dictionary related duties
Maintaining the metric definitions across the business
Collecting and proposing data requirements
Working to agile methodologies




Key requirements:

Strong SQL background (this is a prime requirement)
Strong experience in data visualisation (e.g. Looker, Tableau, Quick Sight, PowerBI, etc)
3+ years’ experience as a data analyst working in a fast-paced environment
Strong deep-dive skills, the ability to tell a strong data story
Good stakeholder engagement experience and the ability to prioritise delivery
Understanding of operational processes




Bonus skills:

A financial technology background, e.g., risk, finance, credit, or electronic trading
Understanding of DBT
Experience with Python
Experience of automation and optimisation

MyTutor is the UK’s leading online platform for one-to-one learning, and we're on a mission to improve the educational outcomes of thousands of young people. We’re building a future where access to high-quality learning is stress-free for those who can afford it, and funded for those who can't.

One-to-one tuition is one of the most powerful ways to improve pupils’ grades, confidence and life chances. Yet it remains out of reach for many. Our handpicked community of tutors work online with students from all walks of life, raising results on average by one whole grade. Since Covid-19 and all the disruption to education, we've worked with the government to provide safe and reliable tuition to more students than ever. We're proud to have worked with over 650 schools across the UK, and our tutors have given over a million lessons.

Since the pandemic, we've scaled up and kept a working environment that encourages collaboration and support. We always prioritise our team's development and well-being, remotely right now, and in an office again in the future. We have regular company socials, and there are chances every week to sit down with someone for a cuppa and a chat.

The role in a nutshell:

Here at MyTutor we are growing our data team, and we’re looking for an experienced, data-driven and passionate Analytics professional to support our wider business.

You’ll be the 7th member of our collaborative data team, which is made up of data analysts, a data scientist and an analytics engineer. You’ll be working in a fast-paced environment with stakeholders across product, marketing, customer success, sales and business operations to drive deeper understanding of the impact of customer and tutor behaviour, acquisition and retention, and overall business health.

With your data expertise and commercial awareness, you’ll influence the strategy and decisions that fuel our rapid growth as we look to become one of the world’s leading learning platforms.

You’ll be working with our analytics engineer to ensure that we build insights in a sustainable fashion, getting a chance to develop your data modelling and coding skills along the way.

We work in an agile way, so expect daily stand-ups, regular retrospectives and beautifully crafted tickets!

Our stack

We have a state-of-the-art data stack at MyTutor:

Snowflake for our data warehouse
Stitch/Airbyte for data ingestion
dbt for data transformation
Paradime for lineage/data catalogue
HighTouch for reverse ETL
Machine learning using Python + Snowpark
Tableau and Lightdash for Data Visualisation


What you can expect:

Be one of the go-to people for business insights and provide a vital link in the strategy - execution - analysis chain to ensure we move quickly and stay ahead.
Lead analysis of various business areas, focused on developing the capability to translate data into actionable insights that will improve campaign performance.
Spend time building beautiful, well-tested and well-documented data models that make self-serve analytics easy
Work with our data scientist to support product discovery and experimentation using cutting-edge advanced analytics techniques
Drive deeper understanding of customer and tutor behaviours, and efficiency of business operations - anything from acquisition, churn and lifetime value to the efficiency of our tools in serving customers.
Assist with ad hoc queries and provide analytical support to our fast-growing business as it evolves.
Seek out new techniques and opportunities for greater efficiency as well as owning best practices across the data function.
A progression framework that includes pathways to analytics engineer and data scientist


The type of person we would love to meet:

You have experience tackling complex analytical challenges, supporting various functions with funnel/spend optimisation and making decisions based high-quality information.
You have advanced skills in data analysis - SQL, statistical methods and modelling on large data sets.
You have excellent data visualisation skills and storytelling, capable of driving actions from stakeholders (e.g. self-service visualisation tools or slide decks).
You have a passion for solving ambiguous, complex and unstructured problems
You are a bar-raiser who sees improving those around you as important as your own delivery
You are comfortable working across multiple projects in a rapidly changing environment, able to balance the need for accuracy and efficiency to prioritise work.
You deliver accurate, meaningful and timely information, based on well-thought-through research and your interpersonal skills enable you to articulate complex concepts in simple terms to stakeholders.


Great if you have:

Experience with dbt (if you don’t have this, it’s basically just SQL with some config so if you’re a SQL whizz you’ll pick it up in no time!)
Experience with git
Experience with AB testing
Experience with GA (not a huge part of the role but we are currently light on GA skills in the team!)
Experience with digital/performance marketing


Benefits:

Flexible working culture with access to our London HQ, global co-working spaces and home office setup
Investment in your learning with a personal L&D budget of up to £350
Workplace pension
£40k - £63k salary, depending on experience (we are hiring at multiple levels)

Mentor/mentee scheme
Regular team events & socials (we've just had a remote Sofar Sounds gig and wine tasting!)
25 days holiday (plus public holidays)
A culture that champions well-being with workshops and 1:1 coaching

The internet is too important to billions of people for it to be at the mercy of a few powerful companies.

Like Polkadot, Parity was built on a foundation of being decentralised and open, which trickles down to how we work. We're a distributed organisation and have been from the beginning. Being distributed isn't just a way of doing business—it's a mentality that is at the core of our culture. We have a flat structure that pushes power to the edges and empowers our people to take ownership of their role, authority coupled with responsibilities.

As the Polkadot ecosystem grows, so does the data associated with it. We are looking for a data analytics professional to perform analytics on all our marketing activities, drive the definition of metrics and implement reporting structures within the Marketing & Communications (Marcomms) department at Parity Technologies.

This is a great opportunity for someone who is passionate about marketing, Web3 and open source blockchain development to spearhead some cutting edge analytics within the Blockchain industry. Also the ability to play a pivotal role in the formation of the data platform and culture at a rapidly growing open-source technology startup.

Key Responsibilities

Lead metric definition and measurement for the department, including supporting the KPI and OKR framework and processes
Work directly with a variety of stakeholders and multiple data sets to derive sophisticated data solutions and dashboards
Create and maintain dashboards to visualize the performance (ROI, attribution etc) of different marketing activities (social media, paid advertising, website traffic, CRM, organic content etc.)
Support the mapping of existing business processes into reporting structures.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on marketing data and open-source blockchain development data within and outside the ecosystem.
Coordinate with the data engineering team to turn the results of this EDA into user-friendly, consumable and automated dashboards.
Coordinate with other departments within Parity to help ensure organizational-wide visibility of Ecosystem Development data.


Qualification and Skills

3+ years of work experience in data analytics.
Strong proficiency in Python,SQL and dashboarding tools.
Experience defining metrics, implementing reporting structures, building and automating dashboards.
Professional experience with marketing data (paid ads, website traffic, CRM etc.) workflows and activities
Knowledge and practical application of statistical techniques in a professional setting.
Familiarity with connecting and harnessing data from a number of different sources.
Ability to work autonomously, be proactive, prioritise, communicate, and function in a small team.
Strong program management skills and able to address multiple projects in parallel managing competing interests and aligning various parties on a common goal.
Ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.


Nice-to-haves

Understanding of blockchain technologies and ecosystems.
Experience with GCP.
Knowledge of GDPR.


Benefits

Working at Parity means focusing on the stuff that counts: building the most cutting-edge technology for the future web. Our teams enjoy a high degree of trust, freedom and autonomy to achieve that goal.
You will gain a keen understanding of blockchain technology and business development and have a skill set transferable to many jobs.
Because we value initiative and learning, we've defined a generous personal budget to attend conferences or skills courses of your choosing. We think you know what's best for you!
Parity is a diverse company with people from various countries, and we will support you with German or English language courses where needed.
Not all of us who collaborate work in the same place. Bringing the team together is something we value a lot, so we regularly go on team retreats.

We want to make second-hand the first choice worldwide.

A team of 1,200+ people from Vinted’s offices in Vilnius, Berlin, Prague, and Amsterdam develop and support our platform. We share a unique work culture that’s based on aiming high, taking ownership, co-creating, caring, and growth.

Vinted is committed to building an inclusive workplace where people from all walks of life feel a sense of belonging. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, colour, national origin, citizenship, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion/beliefs, disability or age. We truly believe when we can be fully ourselves, we work better.

At Vinted, marketing is one of the most impactful channels to grow our platform by making high-stake investment decisions. As a Marketing Decision Scientist, you’ll join our Marketing Data Science & Analytics team where a mix of talented people with backgrounds from academia, econometrics, e-commerce, consulting, and media apply a scientific approach to solve worldwide business problems. In this team we develop statistical and business models, create new methods to measure marketing success, perform advanced data analyses, and ensure that marketing data is reliable. You will report to the Manager of Data Science & Analytics, Marketing Intelligence, and will work in the team of experienced Marketing Decision and Data Scientists. You’ll be expected to be able to accomplish projects individually but at the same time, you’ll have all the support from the team, the DSA guild, and your lead that you may need. You will be responsible for moving millions of people to the path of sustainable consumption.

Within Data Science & Analytics (DSA) we have three distinct roles. We believe that each role can make a similarly sized business impact in different ways and therefore our salary ranges are the same for all three roles. To understand your role within DSA context better, here are brief descriptions of each role we have in the department:

Decision Scientists are responsible for actionable insights, identifying and sizing opportunities, and automated tools that increase the quality of product and business decisions by applying statistical methods and data-driven decision making.
Data Scientists are responsible for identification of algorithmic opportunities, ensuring those opportunities are addressed in an optimal fashion and design, development and maintenance of production-grade statistical and machine learning algorithms.
Analytics Engineers are responsible for data curation – translating data needs from stakeholders into architecting, building and maintaining efficient & reliable data models and pipelines.


In this position, you’ll:

Contribute to the development of new ROI/ROAS and payback models to measure marketing performance
Investigate revenue streams that marketing generates – think of acquisition, reactivation, engagement on both sides of a two-sided market
Analyse how a multitude of marketing channels drive user acquisition and retention, engagement, and revenue
Drive the usage of data & analytics within the organisation by making the marketing data obvious for everyone to understand, interpret, and use in daily decision making
Pitch your findings to your team and marketing colleagues to pivot the models used to measure success
Occasionally help with ad-hoc requests (data questions and consultations, data bugs, analyses, etc.)


About you:

Strong analytical, strategic, and business skills
Highly business-results oriented and able to connect science with pragmatic problem solving
A good communicator who can present results in an informative and persuasive manner to a wide range of stakeholders
Intermediate working experience as a Decision Scientist, Data Analyst, or Data Scientist
Strong knowledge of at least one statistical programming language (R, Python, Stata, Matlab etc.)
Fluency with SQL and experience with dashboarding tools (e.g. Looker, Tableau, etc.)
A graduate degree in statistics, econometrics, economics, business or a similar field
Excellent at communicating in written and spoken English
Advantage: Previous experience with Marketing Analytics, in particular, ROI/ROAS models
Advantage: Strong econometrics knowledge (statistical models, regression analyses)
Advantage: Advanced knowledge of R/Python/Scala


Work perks:

Opportunity to join our share options programme
Learning budget (10% from gross yearly salary)
30 working days of holiday
Mental and emotional health support from Mindletic
Frequent team-building events
A personal budget for shopping on Vinted
A daily allowance for ordering lunch
Work anywhere in the EU for 90 days out of the year and up to 21 days outside the EU
Dog-friendly office
Home office support (IT workstation equipment provided and a personal budget of 540 for home workplace furniture)


We want people to work from where they’re most comfortable, which is why we’re using a hybrid workplace model at Vinted for the foreseeable future.

Hybrid means that we encourage working from the office on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and the remainder of your time from either home or the office, but it’s not required. You’re welcome to work from either location all or some of the time, depending on what you think is best and safest for you, and how the Covid-19 situation is developing where you are.

The salary range for this position is 51,400–67,500 € (gross) per annum.

If this sounds interesting – you may well be just who we need!

MORE THAN A JOB:

Blacklane is a scale-up started in 2011, founded by Jens Wohltorf and Frank Steuer who wanted to create the first global chauffeur service. We started by filling chauffeurs' 'empty leg' journeys and have grown with our partners to over €100 million in annual revenue (pre-pandemic). Backed by Daimler and other investors in Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the UAE, we're now a trusted brand within corporate travel.

We believe in ethical business practices and have a strong company culture. Responding to the pandemic, we've successfully managed the crises and retained our talented crew!

Continuous Learning: We believe that open and actionable feedback is the essential component of continuous development. Set your personal development plan and take an active role in our internal learning communities to progress your career.
Flexible Working: Even the most ambitious Blacklaner needs some time to unwind. Find out what works for you and your team with flexible working hours and home office days (working from home is the new normal).
Become Part of the Crew: Get to know your fellow Blacklaners through our regular team socials. Our success comes from a collaboration of more than 350 people from 70 nations and we are looking for more exceptional people to join us!
Employee Stock Options Plan: We want all Blacklaners to benefit from the company's success, so every employee gets virtual stock options.
Fair Remuneration: We've banded salary levels and matched them to the local costs of living, meaning you're always paid fairly and you know that the rest of the crew is too.
Sustainability: We care for both people and the planet, having launched the mobility's industry first global carbon offset scheme in 2017. Blacklane has pledged to deliver 75% of its journeys in electric vehicles by 2025.
Equal Opportunity: We are committed to inclusion and diversity. A company is only as strong as its crew, so we developed a work environment that is inclusive, inspiring and open. All qualified applicants receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

Blacklane is a scale-up started in 2011, founded by Jens Wohltorf and Frank Steuer who wanted to create the first global chauffeur service. We started by filling chauffeurs’ ‘empty leg’ journeys and have grown with our partners to over €100 million in annual revenue (pre-pandemic). Backed by Daimler and other investors in Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the UAE, we’re now a trusted brand within corporate travel.

We believe in ethical business practices and have a strong company culture. Responding to the pandemic, we’ve successfully managed the crises and retained our talented crew!

POSITION PURPOSE




The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington. Its mission is to deliver to the world timely, relevant, and scientifically valid evidence to improve health policy and practice. IHME carries out its mission through a range of projects within different research areas including the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Future Health Scenarios; Cost Effectiveness and Efficiency; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. Our vision is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base so all people live long lives in full health.




IHME is committed to providing the evidence base necessary to help solve the world’s most important health problems. This requires creativity and innovation, which are cultivated by an inclusive, diverse, and equitable environment that respects and appreciates differences, embraces collaboration, and invites the voices of all IHME team members.




IHME has an outstanding opportunity for a Data Analyst on our Tobacco Metrics team, supporting the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD). A systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time, the GBD is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. The GBD’s aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health. The Surge Team supports research teams through temporary assignments to help meet deadlines, manage unexpected challenges or changes in scope, and fill in where staffing has fallen short.




The main purpose of the Data Analyst position is to provide support to the GBD Tobacco team’s research projects through database management, data quality management, computational support to multidisciplinary research projects, data extraction and formatting, and providing key inputs for papers and presentations. Data Analysts must develop an understanding of different research needs and analytic functions across multiple projects to best meet research needs.
