The mission of the Allen Institute is to unlock the complexities of bioscience and advance our knowledge to improve human health. Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the Allen Institute focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.




The mission of the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics is to answer fundamental questions about brain function. Specifically, how does our brain build our understanding of the complex world around us to guide the flexible behaviors that address our biological needs? The answers will be in terms of defined neuron types interacting across the whole brain and body, requiring us to develop next-generation neurotechnologies and employ a team-based approach for discovery neuroscience. Knowledge, data, and tools will be widely shared, in part to support the development of therapies for brain disorders.




We are seeking a skilled data analyst to design and improve schemas for the data and metadata that are the critical foundation of our mission to support open, reproducible, and FAIR science. The candidate will work closely with internal and external scientific teams to standardize data and write software that facilitates this challenging task.

Position Summary

We are looking for a Data Analyst to join CooperSurgical and help build Embryo Options, the first business of its kind to help guide patients through the process of storing cryopreserved embryos, eggs, and sperm. Embryo Options partners with IVF centers to educate and assist fertility patients with making disposition decisions for their cryopreserved tissue. The IVF center and Embryo Options partnership enables patients to conveniently pay storage fees online, as well as gain access to comprehensive educational content and the world's largest embryo donation platform.

As more and more patients are freezing embryos, eggs, and sperm, our goal is to provide tools to fertility clinics that help their patients to navigate the complicated financial, legal, and ethical issues associated with cryopreservation.

As a Data Analyst on the Embryo Options team, you will work closely with patient data to help IVF centers take advantage of the Embryo Options platform and better understand their patients and their business. Besides helping clinics, you will also develop and visualize insights for the Embryo Options product team that will drive critical business decisions.

You Will

Clean, analyze, and transform clinic cryo-storage data from disparate, unstructured sources like Excel, Microsoft Access, SQL databases, and CSV
Develop reproducible reports and workbooks to help launch new IVF centers on Embryo Options and keep their data accurate and up-to-date
Work closely with our Center Support team to communicate any data issues back to IVF clinics and EMR providers
Provide clear, reproducible analysis to help answer business questions for IVF centers and our product team
Develop intuitive, insightful data visualizations
Collaborate with our product team to identify new application features that help IVF centers better understand their patient data

You Have

2+ years of experience in a Data Analyst role
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, MIS, or a related technical field
Advanced proficiency in SQL
Experience with Excel as well as a programming language like Python or R
Experience designing data visualizations and dashboards using business intelligence tools (Tableau, Looker, Mode, Metabase, etc.)
High attention to detail, including experience with data validation techniques
Precise and effective communication skills for technical and non-technical audiences
Ability to understand the underlying needs of the business and drive impact in a fast-paced, ambiguous environment

NewGlobe supports visionary governments to transform public education systems, the cornerstone of a prosperous, equitable, and peaceful society.




With a comprehensive system transformation platform and data-driven educational services, NewGlobe delivers rapid and dramatic improvements in learning outcomes at state and nationwide scale. Through building impactful partnerships and programmes, NewGlobe ensures that all children have access to an education that will develop their full potential and create a foundation for growth and prosperity.




NewGlobe leverages more than a decade of educational experience and proven impact in integrated school management, teacher professional development, instructional design innovation, technological system support, child-centered classroom practice, and parent engagement -- all grounded in learning science -- to ensure each teacher is empowered to engage children in transformational learning, and all children have the opportunity to develop to their full potential. Every day, NewGlobe supports governments to solve what were once seen as intractable problems, and by doing so, ensures this generation will be able to grow up to lead more fulfilled lives, while simultaneously building economic prosperity for themselves, their communities, and the globe.




NewGlobe’s high-touch, intensive professional development programs, along with integrated school management, teacher support, and assessment software, enable schools to succeed. NewGlobe works within state and national curriculum and syllabi, ensuring all children are empowered to learn their own history, and master local content, while being globally competitive in mathematics and languages. The science of behaviour change and the science of learning is at the foundation of all programming.




NewGlobe works with urgency because youth quickly becomes adulthood and relentlessly because improvement requires continuous problem-solving. NewGlobe is honoured to serve and to help rebuild trust in public systems.




NewGlobe’s work is all encompassing and will challenge you to use your full mind, and heart, each day. We need bright minds who want to be part of building a new globe -- a more equitable globe -- to join us.




Academics




The objective of the Academics group is to drive student achievement. To do so, we must know what is happening minute-by-minute for the typical child. The student’s daily experience, and thus the path to achievement, emerges from their relationship with the teachers and the content that is delivered in the classroom. Our team is collaboratively organized around these levers. We develop rigorous content pitched at the right level for students to be delivered by a teacher who is prepared to succeed in the classroom. Our Instructional Design department builds the content; our Leadership & Development department trains teachers and school leaders using scientifically-proven techniques; our Learning Innovation department looks at cutting-edge research to generate breakthrough learning gains. Underpinning all of this is the work of the independent Measurement and Evaluation group, which provides Academics with an empirical orientation toward improving that daily experience and, in turn, driving achievement.




Measurement & Evaluation




The Measurement & Evaluation team at NewGlobe is housed within the Academics group and collaborates across departments to help leaders assess the quality of teaching and learning at NewGlobe. We work to answer the core questions of “How well are we doing?”, “Are we getting better?”, and “How can we get even better?”. We blend quantitative analyses with qualitative field work to measure what matters most, provide feedback to NewGlobe school leaders and managers, assess our impact on student learning, and communicate the results to various internal and external audiences.




At the heart of our work is comparative analysis. We compare student learning at NewGlobe across time and place. In all of our locations, we examine how much faster NewGlobe students learn than their peers in similar schools. We examine how student performance today compares to student performance yesterday. We examine sub-groups of students to advance equity. We examine variability across our schools to determine which characteristics matter most to student learning. We help NewGlobe managers assess the impact of the changes they have made to accelerate learning.




We take pride in providing rigorous measurement, study design, and analysis. We also take pride in our ability to communicate clearly in words, tables, and data visualizations. We intend our work to make a difference in how NewGlobe managers and our government partners think and act. We judge our own work accordingly.




Collaboration sits at the heart of M&E at NewGlobe. We collaborate with our internal team members as well as with our government partners. With every product, we enter into a collaborative conversation with those who operate and those who study. M&E has established deep partnerships with the education ministries, with local research organizations, and with international researchers who focus on teaching and learning, especially those who focus on the aspects of schooling most relevant to the students we serve.




About The Role




We are seeking a full-time M&E Data Analyst to join our team. We are looking for someone eager to conduct impactful research, share their expertise, and build upon a tradition of evaluation and data excellence at NewGlobe.




The Data Analyst is responsible for supporting the data analysis of different descriptive analyses and impact evaluations within the organization. These analyses can range from simple descriptive analyses using a few Excel formulas, to more complex work using multiple Stata or R scripts. To do this, the Analyst will need to manage all parts of the data analysis process - starting from the design stage through the execution of analyses, and the reporting of the findings to other internal stakeholders.




The analyst is responsible for the provision of high-quality data products that other colleagues can rely on, and build their own work on. As such, this role is at the core of a large portion of all the M&E efforts within NewGlobe, and in consequence, at the intersection of our evaluation efforts to continually deliver stronger education to our students. We view data and analytics as core to our ability to learn as an organization. We want to cultivate data and analytics rock stars, people who produce and use data to reveal actionable insights for NewGlobe’s rapidly growing network of schools. The person in this role will receive constant coaching and mentoring from the rest of the M&E and Data Analytics team, and professional development will be a core feature of this role.




The M&E Analyst should be willing to work in Cambridge, MA. The M&E Analyst will report to the Director, M&E. Significant travel is required.




What You Will Do




Clean and analyze data sets. These data sets can be used to answer questions from a wide range of topics like academic performance, impact evaluation studies, internal RCTs, among others.
Ensure the creation of proper data pipelines and best data management practices.
Contribute to a culture of data-driven decision-making by collaborating with various team members across territories.
Accommodate requests for quick analyses. Time-sensitive questions will come from the VPs and C-Level Executives, and usually take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Oftentimes, you will need to direct your staff to use their best judgment in the face of imperfect data.
Other duties as required by the Directors and VP of M&E, and C-level executives.
What You Should Have




High data literacy and a strong background in econometrics and/or statistics. Previous experience in an academic or applied setting, such as being an analyst, research assistant, data manager, or consultant. Experience in data cleaning, analysis, and/or visualization.
A high level of proficiency with Stata or R, and Excel. Any other data analysis software or coding language is a plus. Experience with survey software like Qualtrics, SurveyCTO, or Google Forms is also a plus.
Undergraduate degree (or its equivalent) or Masters degree – in a relevant academic discipline, for example (but not limited to) Economics, Public or Education Policy, or Statistics.
Strong communication skills and the ability to translate complex ideas for non-technical audiences – you will need effective verbal and written communication skills to provide valuable insights and research reports for internal and external stakeholders.
Belief in data-driven decision making.
Flexible and loves to work in a dynamic environment.
Passion – for NewGlobe’s mission.
Bonus – experience in extreme growth situations and dealing with complexity; worked/studied in a developing country, worked in a no-excuses charter school in high-poverty areas in the U.S., and/or experience implementing data collection projects, particularly for impact evaluations.
You’re also




A detailed doer – You have a track record of getting things done. You’re organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company.
A networking mastermind – You excel at meeting new people and turning them into advocates. You communicate in a clear, conscientious, and effective way in both written and oral speech. You can influence strangers in the course of a single conversation. Allies and colleagues will go to bat for your ideas. You have an existing network from prior experience in the country, preferably in the regulatory, education, or business sectors.
A creative problem-solver – Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, NewGlobe works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand.
A relentless advocate –The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent’s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience, and value.
A malleable learner –You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you’ve missed things or failed today.
A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don’t just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.

        <strong>Who We Are</strong><p><br></p>NewGlobe supports visionary governments to transform public education systems, the cornerstone of a prosperous, equitable, and peaceful society.<p><br></p>With a comprehensive system transformation platform and data-driven educational services, NewGlobe delivers rapid and dramatic improvements in learning outcomes at state and nationwide scale. Through building impactful partnerships and programmes, NewGlobe ensures that all children have access to an education that will develop their full potential and create a foundation for growth and prosperity.<p><br></p>NewGlobe leverages more than a decade of educational experience and proven impact in integrated school management, teacher professional development, instructional design innovation, technological system support, child-centered classroom practice, and parent engagement -- all grounded in learning science -- to ensure each teacher is empowered to engage children in transformational learning, and all children have the opportunity to develop to their full potential. Every day, NewGlobe supports governments to solve what were once seen as intractable problems, and by doing so, ensures this generation will be able to grow up to lead more fulfilled lives, while simultaneously building economic prosperity for themselves, their communities, and the globe.<p><br></p>NewGlobe’s high-touch, intensive professional development programs, along with integrated school management, teacher support, and assessment software, enable schools to succeed. NewGlobe works within state and national curriculum and syllabi, ensuring all children are empowered to learn their own history, and master local content, while being globally competitive in mathematics and languages. The science of behaviour change and the science of learning is at the foundation of all programming.<p><br></p>NewGlobe works with urgency because youth quickly becomes adulthood and relentlessly because improvement requires continuous problem-solving. NewGlobe is honoured to serve and to help rebuild trust in public systems.<p><br></p>NewGlobe’s work is all encompassing and will challenge you to use your full mind, and heart, each day. We need bright minds who want to be part of building a new globe -- a more equitable globe -- to join us.<p><br></p><strong> Academics </strong><p><br></p>The objective of the Academics group is to drive student achievement. To do so, we must know what is happening minute-by-minute for the typical child. The student’s daily experience, and thus the path to achievement, emerges from their relationship with the teachers and the content that is delivered in the classroom. Our team is collaboratively organized around these levers. We develop rigorous content pitched at the right level for students to be delivered by a teacher who is prepared to succeed in the classroom. Our Instructional Design department builds the content; our Leadership &amp; Development department trains teachers and school leaders using scientifically-proven techniques; our Learning Innovation department looks at cutting-edge research to generate breakthrough learning gains. Underpinning all of this is the work of the independent Measurement and Evaluation group, which provides Academics with an empirical orientation toward improving that daily experience and, in turn, driving achievement.<p><br></p><strong> Measurement &amp; Evaluation </strong><p><br></p>The Measurement &amp; Evaluation team at NewGlobe is housed within the Academics group and collaborates across departments to help leaders assess the quality of teaching and learning at NewGlobe. We work to answer the core questions of “How well are we doing?”, “Are we getting better?”, and “How can we get even better?”. We blend quantitative analyses with qualitative field work to measure what matters most, provide feedback to NewGlobe school leaders and managers, assess our impact on student learning, and communicate the results to various internal and external audiences.<p><br></p>At the heart of our work is comparative analysis. We compare student learning at NewGlobe across time and place. In all of our locations, we examine how much faster NewGlobe students learn than their peers in similar schools. We examine how student performance today compares to student performance yesterday. We examine sub-groups of students to advance equity. We examine variability across our schools to determine which characteristics matter most to student learning. We help NewGlobe managers assess the impact of the changes they have made to accelerate learning.<p><br></p>We take pride in providing rigorous measurement, study design, and analysis. We also take pride in our ability to communicate clearly in words, tables, and data visualizations. We intend our work to make a difference in how NewGlobe managers and our government partners think and act. We judge our own work accordingly.<p><br></p>Collaboration sits at the heart of M&amp;E at NewGlobe. We collaborate with our internal team members as well as with our government partners. With every product, we enter into a collaborative conversation with those who operate and those who study. M&amp;E has established deep partnerships with the education ministries, with local research organizations, and with international researchers who focus on teaching and learning, especially those who focus on the aspects of schooling most relevant to the students we serve.<p><br></p><strong>About The Role</strong><p><br></p>We are seeking a full-time M&amp;E Data Analyst to join our team. We are looking for someone eager to conduct impactful research, share their expertise, and build upon a tradition of evaluation and data excellence at NewGlobe.<p><br></p>The Data Analyst is responsible for supporting the data analysis of different descriptive analyses and impact evaluations within the organization. These analyses can range from simple descriptive analyses using a few Excel formulas, to more complex work using multiple Stata or R scripts. To do this, the Analyst will need to manage all parts of the data analysis process - starting from the design stage through the execution of analyses, and the reporting of the findings to other internal stakeholders.<p><br></p>The analyst is responsible for the provision of high-quality data products that other colleagues can rely on, and build their own work on. As such, this role is at the core of a large portion of all the M&amp;E efforts within NewGlobe, and in consequence, at the intersection of our evaluation efforts to continually deliver stronger education to our students. We view data and analytics as core to our ability to learn as an organization. We want to cultivate data and analytics rock stars, people who produce and use data to reveal actionable insights for NewGlobe’s rapidly growing network of schools. The person in this role will receive constant coaching and mentoring from the rest of the M&amp;E and Data Analytics team, and professional development will be a core feature of this role.<p><br></p>The M&amp;E Analyst should be willing to work in Cambridge, MA. The M&amp;E Analyst will report to the Director, M&amp;E. Significant travel is required.<p><br></p><strong>What You Will Do</strong><p><br></p><ul><li>Clean and analyze data sets. These data sets can be used to answer questions from a wide range of topics like academic performance, impact evaluation studies, internal RCTs, among others. </li><li>Ensure the creation of proper data pipelines and best data management practices. </li><li>Contribute to a culture of data-driven decision-making by collaborating with various team members across territories.</li><li>Accommodate requests for quick analyses. Time-sensitive questions will come from the VPs and C-Level Executives, and usually take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Oftentimes, you will need to direct your staff to use their best judgment in the face of imperfect data. </li><li>Other duties as required by the Directors and VP of M&amp;E, and C-level executives.</li></ul> <strong> What You Should Have </strong><p><br></p><ul><li>High data literacy and a strong background in econometrics and/or statistics. Previous experience in an academic or applied setting, such as being an analyst, research assistant, data manager, or consultant. Experience in data cleaning, analysis, and/or visualization. </li><li>A high level of proficiency with Stata or R, and Excel. Any other data analysis software or coding language is a plus. Experience with survey software like Qualtrics, SurveyCTO, or Google Forms is also a plus. </li><li>Undergraduate degree (or its equivalent) or Masters degree – in a relevant academic discipline, for example (but not limited to) Economics, Public or Education Policy, or Statistics. </li><li>Strong communication skills and the ability to translate complex ideas for non-technical audiences – you will need effective verbal and written communication skills to provide valuable insights and research reports for internal and external stakeholders. </li><li>Belief in data-driven decision making.</li><li>Flexible and loves to work in a dynamic environment.</li><li>Passion – for NewGlobe’s mission. </li><li>Bonus – experience in extreme growth situations and dealing with complexity; worked/studied in a developing country, worked in a no-excuses charter school in high-poverty areas in the U.S., and/or experience implementing data collection projects, particularly for impact evaluations. </li></ul> <strong> You’re also </strong><p><br></p><ul><li>A detailed doer – You have a track record of getting things done. You’re organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company. </li><li>A networking mastermind – You excel at meeting new people and turning them into advocates. You communicate in a clear, conscientious, and effective way in both written and oral speech. You can influence strangers in the course of a single conversation. Allies and colleagues will go to bat for your ideas. You have an existing network from prior experience in the country, preferably in the regulatory, education, or business sectors. </li><li>A creative problem-solver – Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, NewGlobe works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand. </li><li>A relentless advocate –The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent’s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience, and value. </li><li>A malleable learner –You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you’ve missed things or failed today. </li><li>A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don’t just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.</li></ul>

We believe that each role can make a similarly sized business impact in different ways and therefore our salary ranges are the same for all three roles. To understand your role within DSA context better, here are brief descriptions of each role we have in the department:

Decision Scientists are responsible for actionable insights, identifying and sizing opportunities, and automated tools that increase the quality of product and business decisions by applying statistical methods and data-driven decision making.
Data Scientists are responsible for identification of algorithmic opportunities, ensuring those opportunities are addressed in an optimal fashion and design, development and maintenance of production-grade statistical and machine learning algorithms.
Analytics Engineers are responsible for data curation – translating data needs from stakeholders into architecting, building and maintaining efficient & reliable data models and pipelines.


In this position, you’ll:

Contribute to the development of new ROI/ROAS and payback models to measure marketing performance
Investigate revenue streams that marketing generates – think of acquisition, reactivation, engagement on both sides of a two-sided market
Analyse how a multitude of marketing channels drive user acquisition and retention, engagement, and revenue
Drive the usage of data & analytics within the organisation by making the marketing data obvious for everyone to understand, interpret, and use in daily decision making
Pitch your findings to your team and marketing colleagues to pivot the models used to measure success
Occasionally help with ad-hoc requests (data questions and consultations, data bugs, analyses, etc.)


About you:

Strong analytical, strategic, and business skills
Highly business-results oriented and able to connect science with pragmatic problem solving
A good communicator who can present results in an informative and persuasive manner to a wide range of stakeholders
Intermediate working experience as a Decision Scientist, Data Analyst, or Data Scientist
Strong knowledge of at least one statistical programming language (R, Python, Stata, Matlab etc.)
Fluency with SQL and experience with dashboarding tools (e.g. Looker, Tableau, etc.)
A graduate degree in statistics, econometrics, economics, business or a similar field
Excellent at communicating in written and spoken English
Advantage: Previous experience with Marketing Analytics, in particular, ROI/ROAS models
Advantage: Strong econometrics knowledge (statistical models, regression analyses)
Advantage: Advanced knowledge of R/Python/Scala


Work perks:

Opportunity to join our share options programme
Learning budget (10% from gross yearly salary)
30 working days of holiday
Mental and emotional health support from Mindletic
Frequent team-building events
A personal budget for shopping on Vinted
A daily allowance for ordering lunch
Work anywhere in the EU for 90 days out of the year and up to 21 days outside the EU
Dog-friendly office
Home office support (IT workstation equipment provided and a personal budget of 540 for home workplace furniture)


We want people to work from where they’re most comfortable, which is why we’re using a hybrid workplace model at Vinted for the foreseeable future.

Hybrid means that we encourage working from the office on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and the remainder of your time from either home or the office, but it’s not required. You’re welcome to work from either location all or some of the time, depending on what you think is best and safest for you, and how the Covid-19 situation is developing where you are.

The salary range for this position is 51,400–67,500 € (gross) per annum.

If this sounds interesting – you may well be just who we need!

The internet is too important to billions of people for it to be at the mercy of a few powerful companies.

Like Polkadot, Parity was built on a foundation of being decentralised and open, which trickles down to how we work. We're a distributed organisation and have been from the beginning. Being distributed isn't just a way of doing business—it's a mentality that is at the core of our culture. We have a flat structure that pushes power to the edges and empowers our people to take ownership of their role, authority coupled with responsibilities.

As the Polkadot ecosystem grows, so does the data associated with it. We are looking for a data analytics professional to perform analytics on all our marketing activities, drive the definition of metrics and implement reporting structures within the Marketing & Communications (Marcomms) department at Parity Technologies.

This is a great opportunity for someone who is passionate about marketing, Web3 and open source blockchain development to spearhead some cutting edge analytics within the Blockchain industry. Also the ability to play a pivotal role in the formation of the data platform and culture at a rapidly growing open-source technology startup.

Key Responsibilities

Lead metric definition and measurement for the department, including supporting the KPI and OKR framework and processes
Work directly with a variety of stakeholders and multiple data sets to derive sophisticated data solutions and dashboards
Create and maintain dashboards to visualize the performance (ROI, attribution etc) of different marketing activities (social media, paid advertising, website traffic, CRM, organic content etc.)
Support the mapping of existing business processes into reporting structures.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on marketing data and open-source blockchain development data within and outside the ecosystem.
Coordinate with the data engineering team to turn the results of this EDA into user-friendly, consumable and automated dashboards.
Coordinate with other departments within Parity to help ensure organizational-wide visibility of Ecosystem Development data.


Qualification and Skills

3+ years of work experience in data analytics.
Strong proficiency in Python,SQL and dashboarding tools.
Experience defining metrics, implementing reporting structures, building and automating dashboards.
Professional experience with marketing data (paid ads, website traffic, CRM etc.) workflows and activities
Knowledge and practical application of statistical techniques in a professional setting.
Familiarity with connecting and harnessing data from a number of different sources.
Ability to work autonomously, be proactive, prioritise, communicate, and function in a small team.
Strong program management skills and able to address multiple projects in parallel managing competing interests and aligning various parties on a common goal.
Ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.


Nice-to-haves

Understanding of blockchain technologies and ecosystems.
Experience with GCP.
Knowledge of GDPR.


Benefits

Working at Parity means focusing on the stuff that counts: building the most cutting-edge technology for the future web. Our teams enjoy a high degree of trust, freedom and autonomy to achieve that goal.
You will gain a keen understanding of blockchain technology and business development and have a skill set transferable to many jobs.
Because we value initiative and learning, we've defined a generous personal budget to attend conferences or skills courses of your choosing. We think you know what's best for you!
Parity is a diverse company with people from various countries, and we will support you with German or English language courses where needed.
Not all of us who collaborate work in the same place. Bringing the team together is something we value a lot, so we regularly go on team retreats.

MORE THAN A JOB:

Blacklane is a scale-up started in 2011, founded by Jens Wohltorf and Frank Steuer who wanted to create the first global chauffeur service. We started by filling chauffeurs' 'empty leg' journeys and have grown with our partners to over €100 million in annual revenue (pre-pandemic). Backed by Daimler and other investors in Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the UAE, we're now a trusted brand within corporate travel.

We believe in ethical business practices and have a strong company culture. Responding to the pandemic, we've successfully managed the crises and retained our talented crew!

Continuous Learning: We believe that open and actionable feedback is the essential component of continuous development. Set your personal development plan and take an active role in our internal learning communities to progress your career.
Flexible Working: Even the most ambitious Blacklaner needs some time to unwind. Find out what works for you and your team with flexible working hours and home office days (working from home is the new normal).
Become Part of the Crew: Get to know your fellow Blacklaners through our regular team socials. Our success comes from a collaboration of more than 350 people from 70 nations and we are looking for more exceptional people to join us!
Employee Stock Options Plan: We want all Blacklaners to benefit from the company's success, so every employee gets virtual stock options.
Fair Remuneration: We've banded salary levels and matched them to the local costs of living, meaning you're always paid fairly and you know that the rest of the crew is too.
Sustainability: We care for both people and the planet, having launched the mobility's industry first global carbon offset scheme in 2017. Blacklane has pledged to deliver 75% of its journeys in electric vehicles by 2025.
Equal Opportunity: We are committed to inclusion and diversity. A company is only as strong as its crew, so we developed a work environment that is inclusive, inspiring and open. All qualified applicants receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

At Staffbase we believe that Internal Communication moves people, and people move companies. Our mission is to empower leaders and communicators to drive transformation through internal comms solutions, strategies, and insights. Our most recent Series E funding led by General Atlantic, officially launched us to 🦄 UNICORN 🦄 status!

We're headquartered in Chemnitz, Germany, with offices in many locations throughout the world, including Vancouver, Kelowna, New York, Amsterdam, London, and several locations in Germany! Our international team counts more than 800 employees from 45+ nationalities and we have a growing base of 1000+ enterprise customers that want to transform their employee experience. We are rapidly scaling, post-Series E ($115 million funding), have strong-growing revenue, and our customers love us.

We are looking for a Data Engineer to help drive our growing Data team. The role can be associated with one of our German offices.

The Data team at Staffbase is the central nervous system of all things data. As a member of that team, you will further shape our Data Engineering practice and partner with a variety of teams across engineering and product to enhance the way we collect, transform and utilize data. You will be joining a team of four analysts and one data engineer, so you're not going to be just another cog in the machine. You will carry a lot of responsibility and ownership. Our data landscape is still formative which comes with a lot of freedom to create new things but also with a lot of responsibility and at times uncertainty.

In 2021-2022 we set the foundations of a GDPR-compliant Data Warehouse on Google BigQuery. In 2023 and beyond we are going to build up a mature and modern data infrastructure around GCP, dbt, Airflow and other technologies. You want to leave a deep footprint in a market-leading company's data environment, help serve some of the largest companies in the world and impact the lives of millions of employees? Then this job is for you.

What you'll be doing

Design, build and maintain reliable data pipelines that connect a variety of sources with our BigQuery data warehouse
Take ownership of large-scale architectural decisions for processing, anonymizing and storing our massive amounts of data
Facilitate batch and real-time data processing workflows to fuel data-driven functionality in our product
Leverage the capabilities of dbt and data orchestration tools to create a landscape of accurate, performant and resilient datasets
Proactively identify opportunities for scalability, observability and reliability improvements
Advise on data engineering approaches that balance outcomes, performance and GDPR compliance


What you need to be successful

Experience in working as a Data Engineer, data architect or as a data-enthusiastic Backend Engineer
You work with cloud-based data warehouse technologies, SQL, Python or another major programming language
You are familiar with dbt, Airflow, Spark and Kafka

Our Global Benefits

Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP)

Staffbase offers you a benefit plan which entitles you to an ownership interest in stock options in the company. We're in business to create value for our shareholders and we want our employees to benefit from that shared success as well.

Ongoing Learning

We thrive on personal and professional growth. Every employee gets €1,800/$2,200/£1,650 per year to spend on personal and professional development.

Feel Good Fridays

Summertime means extended vacation time at Staffbase! During August we run the 4-days workweek which means that during this month Fridays are off for all employees.

Flexibility

When it comes to your personal life, it's not our place to dictate your schedule. We offer full time and flexible work-from-home options.

Parental Leave

We recognize that one of the most special events in an individual's life is the birth or adoption of a child. We offer paid parental leave options for all employees.

We are seen as the go-to-destination for top talent from across the globe. Everyday we strive to make Trade Republic a great environment to do the best work of your life, surrounded by exceptional, caring and passionate colleagues. In addition to learning and growing with a world-class team, you will build a destination for everyone across Europe to put money to work.

About The Role

The Data Insights team is a small unit of our central data team and focuses on driving selected high-impact analytics topics which cannot be solved via our widely used self-service tools. We help the whole organisation and work on a very wide range of topics. Projects range from measuring the impact of recent product launches to supporting product experimentation and help defining company KPIs to measure our strategy in close collaboration with the management team.

As an Analytics Engineer in this team, you will work on these projects one-by-one, digging into new topics frequently and building knowledge across the whole organisation.

Create insightful reports that break down complex findings into understandable results
Improve our dashboarding infrastructure (we use Looker) and help people in the company build dashboards that tell a story to ensure data-informed decisions
Closely work with our product and platform engineering teams, setting up tracking and building pipelines for new features
Embrace experimentation and testing to ensure incremental improvements


WHO ARE YOU?

We are aware that everyone has their individual strengths and weaknesses. The one thing where we don’t compromise is joy for our work and dedication to our shared mission. If you feel you are not ticking all the boxes below, but have a good general feeling about most of them, we would be very happy to talk!

At least 3 years of analytics experience with an engineering mindset
Orientation on personal and professional growth, you never settle with what you have
Outstanding business acumen and an interest in FinTech
Exceptional interpersonal and communication skills, you are good in understanding what stakeholders want and translating it into an analytics solution

Capable of prioritising based on impact and estimating the effort needed for an outcome
Good understanding of statistics with respect to analysing A/B experiments and ability to communicate their results in a simple, yet correct form to stakeholders
Experience with our tech stack: AWS/Snowflake/Airflow/Python/SQL and ideally also DBT

At Trade Republic you will get to do the best work of your career. We are a destination for people who are exceptional at what they do. Every day, we strive to build a world-class team and provide the space for people to do their best. We have a relentless ambition of raising the bar and expect the best from ourselves. Through our dedicated people-first management approach and transparent career paths, you will have the opportunity to develop and grow your career like never before.

At Trade Republic, we are on a mission to democratize wealth. We set up millions of Europeans for wealth with fast, easy, and free access to capital markets. With over one million customers we are one of the largest savings platforms in Europe, with users holding over €6 billion on our platform.

We are seen as the go-to-destination for top talent from across the globe. Everyday we strive to make Trade Republic a great environment to do the best work of your life, surrounded by exceptional, caring and passionate colleagues. In addition to learning and growing with a world-class team, you will build a destination for everyone across Europe to put money to work.

About The Role

The Data Insights team is a small unit of our central data team and focuses on driving selected high-impact analytics topics which cannot be solved via our widely used self-service tools. We help the whole organisation and work on a very wide range of topics. Projects range from measuring the impact of recent product launches to supporting product experimentation and help defining company KPIs to measure our strategy in close collaboration with the management team.

As an Analytics Engineer in this team, you will work on these projects one-by-one, digging into new topics frequently and building knowledge across the whole organisation. As a team, we build on this wide-reaching overview and help the management team connect the dots on a high level when it comes to generating insights.

YOUR DAY TO DAY INVOLVES

Understand stakeholders' needs and create a tailored analytics approach for their business problem
Create insightful reports that break down complex findings into understandable results
Improve our dashboarding infrastructure (we use Looker) and help people in the company build dashboards that tell a story to ensure data-informed decisions
Closely work with our product and platform engineering teams, setting up tracking and building pipelines for new features
Embrace experimentation and testing to ensure incremental improvements


WHO ARE YOU?

We are aware that everyone has their individual strengths and weaknesses. The one thing where we don't compromise is joy for our work and dedication to our shared mission. If you feel you are not ticking all the boxes below, but have a good general feeling about most of them, we would be very happy to talk!

At least 3 years of analytics experience with an engineering mindset
Orientation on personal and professional growth, you never settle with what you have
Outstanding business acumen and an interest in FinTech
Exceptional interpersonal and communication skills, you are good in understanding what stakeholders want and translating it into an analytics solution
Proven experience with setting-up and improving data visualisation tools, preferably Looker
Capable of prioritising based on impact and estimating the effort needed for an outcome
Good understanding of statistics with respect to analysing A/B experiments and ability to communicate their results in a simple, yet correct form to stakeholders
Experience with our tech stack: AWS/Snowflake/Airflow/Python/SQL and ideally also DBT


WHY YOU SHOULD APPLY NOW

At Trade Republic you will get to do the best work of your career. We are a destination for people who are exceptional at what they do. Every day, we strive to build a world-class team and provide the space for people to do their best. We have a relentless ambition of raising the bar and expect the best from ourselves. Through our dedicated people-first management approach and transparent career paths, you will have the opportunity to develop and grow your career like never before. And because you are surrounded by a diverse team of high performers, you will be learning every day.

You will play an important role in fixing one of the largest challenges we face - closing the pension gap and democratizing wealth.

We search, find and coordinate service capacities so that hospitals can focus on their patients rather than processes.

Within a very short time, Recare was able to onboard over 750 acute care and rehabilitation clinics as well as over 14 000 other service providers on its platform. Renowned hospitals and hospital groups such as Vivantes, Sana Kliniken AG, München Klinik, Hannover Medical School, and Essen University Hospital are among Recare's customers, as well as major health insurances such as TK, BKK and Barmer.

Example product use case - Rehabilitation

When a patient needs to be transferred to a rehabilitation clinic after a hospital stay, hospital staff currently have to:

fax (yes, fax...) forms to the patient's insurance to ask whether they are eligible for rehabilitation
find an available clinic offering the needed services (generally done by calling many and sharing patient data via fax).


With RECARE, hospital staff upload all relevant patient information in one place with the click of a button directly from the hospital’s information system, and can share it securely with all parties involved. An automated search is then started to find an available spot within our network of rehabilitation clinics.

Rehabilitation is just one of our use cases, we also cover care, transport, medical supplies and hospital transfers. Our product combines a SaaS with a marketplace to automate time-intensive tasks and free up hospital resources for patients rather than processes.

Aufgaben

MORE THAN A JOB:

Blacklane is a scale-up started in 2011, founded by Jens Wohltorf and Frank Steuer who wanted to create the first global chauffeur service. We started by filling chauffeurs’ ‘empty leg’ journeys and have grown with our partners to over €100 million in annual revenue (pre-pandemic). Backed by Daimler and other investors in Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the UAE, we’re now a trusted brand within corporate travel.

We believe in ethical business practices and have a strong company culture. Responding to the pandemic, we’ve successfully managed the crises and retained our talented crew!




Continuous Learning: We believe that open and actionable feedback is the essential component of continuous development. Set your personal development plan and take an active role in our internal learning communities to progress your career.

Employee Stock Options Plan: We want all Blacklaners to benefit from the company's success, so every employee gets virtual stock options.
Fair Remuneration: We’ve banded salary levels and matched them to the local costs of living, meaning you’re always paid fairly and you know that the rest of the crew is too.
Sustainability: We care for both people and the planet, having launched the mobility's industry first global carbon offset scheme in 2017. Blacklane has pledged to deliver 75% of its journeys in electric vehicles by 2025.
Equal Opportunity: We are committed to inclusion and diversity. A company is only as strong as its crew, so we developed a work environment that is inclusive, inspiring and open.

Our target customers stock spare parts worth $1,000,000,000,000 (yes, $1trn) - 75% of which are rarely or never used. Sparrow changes that - we reduce our customers’ overstock and waste (making them more sustainable).

Sparrow offers a SaaS platform that ensures maintenance teams have the right spare parts when and where they need them, at the lowest possible cost. To do that, we leverage big data, AI algorithms and a network approach.

Our products are used by some of the world’s leading companies.

We’re based in Berlin, serving customers across Europe and growing fast.

Job Description

We’re looking for a Data Engineer (m/f/x) to join our team. As a Data Engineer at Sparrow, you will use custom and off-the-shelf tools to analyze and improve our customers’ (and Sparrow’s) data.

Because data is our business, we look for a particular kind of data demon. Someone who loves working with data, is super data curious and enjoys making sense of it.

You’ll be a good match if

You’re data curious and get a real buzz out of solving problems with data - maybe you were that kid who scraped the Pokémon online encyclopedia to build your personal database, or maybe you scanned past school exams and ran analysis to predict the next-exam’s questions … in which case you’ll fit right in.

What this role is:

Deep diving into knotty data and figuring out how to simplify it, then systemise it
Troubleshooting problematic data issues
Customer focused - every step of the way


What this role is not:

A database admin
Working through service tickets
A software engineering role


Your responsibilities will include:

Creating tools and processes for data extraction and processing
Using the above tools (and others) to improve data quality
Managing and optimizing product data catalogs


What’s in it for you?

Professional development through coaching and mentoring
Diverse tasks: from scripting through Excel wizardry and up to Machine Learning with new challenges around every corner
Career growth opportunities: when Sparrow grows, so do you
Remote work: we are extremely flexible and open to any working pattern that can adjust to Berlin timezone -/+ 2hrs
Your work directly impacts the company’s success
Working with a small and strong team where every voice counts
Virtual shares


Requirements

You have 2+ years of experience using SQL on large data sets.
You have a basic(+) knowledge of scripting, likely Python or similar languages
You have a good command of spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets).
You are able to learn how to work with new tools quickly.
You communicate well in English; German knowledge is a plus.


Values/ mindset/ qualities

Analytical and data driven – you believe in magic only if it fits in an Excel formula
Relentless – you stop dancing 2 hours after the party has ended
Brutally honest – you can’t help but say what you think
Long term thinker – you appreciate that great things take time to build
Entrepreneurial mindset – you find opportunities everywhere


How to apply

Send your CV or LinkedIn profile

We consider everyone equally: your race, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, marital status, nationality, or any other protected characteristic won’t affect your application.

At MongoDB we are transforming industries and empowering developers to build amazing apps that people use every day. We are the leading modern data platform and the first database provider to IPO in over 20 years. Join our team and be at the forefront of innovation and creativity.

The Database Experience team builds the libraries and tools that developers use day-to-day working with MongoDB. Our mission is to increase developer adoption, satisfaction and retention by providing a reliable, enjoyable interface for developers and other end-users.

Our senior engineers are typically specialists in a particular programming language, but are capable of contributing to projects in other languages as well.

For this role, we're looking for someone who enjoys designing, writing, and supporting Open Source libraries and standalone tools for developers and administrators using MongoDB. You will have the opportunity to be surrounded by veteran Java programmers, as you deepen your knowledge of the Java ecosystem, or advance your career as a writer and speaker.

You might be right for this role if you

Have 4+ years of experience writing high-quality software
Experience implementing libraries or applications in Java or other languages that run on the JVM
Are fascinated by, and have experience working with concurrency, parallelism and distributed systems
Want to participate in Open Source software development and communities
Communicate well, internally and externally, both in writing and face-to-face
Advocate for testing and agile development best practices
Can make pragmatic design tradeoffs while balancing features, maintainability, and delivery time
Elevate the skills and expertise of those around you
Are excited by our mission and values


You'll be on the team responsible for

Java driver, Java Reactive Streams Driver, Scala Driver, Spark Connector, Kafka Connector, and other JVM-based projects
Testing, delivering and supporting the above across multiple operating systems, JDKs, and MongoDB releases


You'll Have Responsibilities Beyond Writing Code, Including

Working with our Product, Server and Cloud teams on designs and specifications for new customer-facing MongoDB features
Investigating bugs and support requests from commercial and Open Source customers for the libraries and tools our team maintains
Seeking out speaking or writing opportunities to engage with our developer community
Mentoring junior engineers in both technical and non-technical professional skills


Success in this role means

Within three months, you'll know most of the codebase you are responsible for, and will be contributing effectively day-to-day, fixing bugs, and implementing already-planned features.
Within six months, you will contribute to the roadmap for our products and lead the design and specification of new features. You will have the trust of the team and our internal customers.
Within a year, you will have significantly improved the quality, performance and maintainability of our codebase, and will be taking the lead in designing new features to solve novel customer challenges
