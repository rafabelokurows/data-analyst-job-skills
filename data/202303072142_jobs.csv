The Hub Program is modernizing its data reporting by improving user experience and introducing internal efficiencies, including the automation of indicator methodology calculations.




Disclosures of health information are made at the highest degree of anonymity possible while still meeting the research and/or analytical purposes. This Client publicly releases aggregated data in a manner designed to minimize any risk of re-identification and residual disclosure.




The Client is endeavouring to automate complex statistical disclosure controls (e.g. small cell-size suppression) to reduce the burden of their manual application, thereby introducing internal efficiencies and improve the timeliness of our reporting.




Responsibilities




Assess three statistical disclosure control tools (G-Confid, Tau-Argus and sdcTable) for their ability to meet the Client’s need to automate statistical disclosure control techniques (e.g. primary and complementary cell suppressions, rounding, etc) for a variety of multi-dimensional, linked and hierarchical aggregate data tables sourcing clinical databases and survey data, with the goal of minimizing disclosure risk while maximizing information utility.
Conduct a proof of concept demonstrating the tools’ features and capabilities using a variety of aggregate data tables, while highlighting how each of the tools could fit into operational data production processes.
Write a report summarizing the findings and recommend which among these tools would best meet the Client’s needs.
Create plain-language documentation to support the application of preferred disclosure control techniques to aggregate data sets using the recommended tool.
Knowledge transfer to support ongoing in-house operational application of the preferred statistical disclosure control techniques for future data releases.

About Moderna

In over 10 years since its inception, Moderna has transformed from a research-stage company advancing programs in the field of messenger RNA (mRNA), to an enterprise with a diverse clinical portfolio of vaccines and therapeutics across seven modalities, a broad intellectual property portfolio in areas including mRNA and lipid nanoparticle formulation, and an integrated manufacturing plant that allows for rapid clinical and commercial production at scale. Moderna maintains alliances with a broad range of domestic and overseas government and commercial collaborators, which has allowed for the pursuit of both groundbreaking science and rapid scaling of manufacturing. Most recently, Moderna's capabilities have come together to allow the authorized use and approval of one of the earliest and most effective vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic.

Moderna's mRNA platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mRNA science, delivery technology and manufacturing, and has allowed the development of therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases, cardiovascular diseases and autoimmune diseases. Moderna has been named a top biopharmaceutical employer by Science for the past seven years. To learn more, visit www.modernatx.com.

NewGlobe supports visionary governments to transform public education systems, the cornerstone of a prosperous, equitable, and peaceful society.




With a comprehensive system transformation platform and data-driven educational services, NewGlobe delivers rapid and dramatic improvements in learning outcomes at state and nationwide scale. Through building impactful partnerships and programmes, NewGlobe ensures that all children have access to an education that will develop their full potential and create a foundation for growth and prosperity.




NewGlobe leverages more than a decade of educational experience and proven impact in integrated school management, teacher professional development, instructional design innovation, technological system support, child-centered classroom practice, and parent engagement -- all grounded in learning science -- to ensure each teacher is empowered to engage children in transformational learning, and all children have the opportunity to develop to their full potential. Every day, NewGlobe supports governments to solve what were once seen as intractable problems, and by doing so, ensures this generation will be able to grow up to lead more fulfilled lives, while simultaneously building economic prosperity for themselves, their communities, and the globe.




NewGlobe’s high-touch, intensive professional development programs, along with integrated school management, teacher support, and assessment software, enable schools to succeed. NewGlobe works within state and national curriculum and syllabi, ensuring all children are empowered to learn their own history, and master local content, while being globally competitive in mathematics and languages. The science of behaviour change and the science of learning is at the foundation of all programming.




NewGlobe works with urgency because youth quickly becomes adulthood and relentlessly because improvement requires continuous problem-solving. NewGlobe is honoured to serve and to help rebuild trust in public systems.




NewGlobe’s work is all encompassing and will challenge you to use your full mind, and heart, each day. We need bright minds who want to be part of building a new globe -- a more equitable globe -- to join us.




Academics




The objective of the Academics group is to drive student achievement. To do so, we must know what is happening minute-by-minute for the typical child. The student’s daily experience, and thus the path to achievement, emerges from their relationship with the teachers and the content that is delivered in the classroom. Our team is collaboratively organized around these levers. We develop rigorous content pitched at the right level for students to be delivered by a teacher who is prepared to succeed in the classroom. Our Instructional Design department builds the content; our Leadership & Development department trains teachers and school leaders using scientifically-proven techniques; our Learning Innovation department looks at cutting-edge research to generate breakthrough learning gains. Underpinning all of this is the work of the independent Measurement and Evaluation group, which provides Academics with an empirical orientation toward improving that daily experience and, in turn, driving achievement.




Measurement & Evaluation




The Measurement & Evaluation team at NewGlobe is housed within the Academics group and collaborates across departments to help leaders assess the quality of teaching and learning at NewGlobe. We work to answer the core questions of “How well are we doing?”, “Are we getting better?”, and “How can we get even better?”. We blend quantitative analyses with qualitative field work to measure what matters most, provide feedback to NewGlobe school leaders and managers, assess our impact on student learning, and communicate the results to various internal and external audiences.




At the heart of our work is comparative analysis. We compare student learning at NewGlobe across time and place. In all of our locations, we examine how much faster NewGlobe students learn than their peers in similar schools. We examine how student performance today compares to student performance yesterday. We examine sub-groups of students to advance equity. We examine variability across our schools to determine which characteristics matter most to student learning. We help NewGlobe managers assess the impact of the changes they have made to accelerate learning.




We take pride in providing rigorous measurement, study design, and analysis. We also take pride in our ability to communicate clearly in words, tables, and data visualizations. We intend our work to make a difference in how NewGlobe managers and our government partners think and act. We judge our own work accordingly.




Collaboration sits at the heart of M&E at NewGlobe. We collaborate with our internal team members as well as with our government partners. With every product, we enter into a collaborative conversation with those who operate and those who study. M&E has established deep partnerships with the education ministries, with local research organizations, and with international researchers who focus on teaching and learning, especially those who focus on the aspects of schooling most relevant to the students we serve.




About The Role




We are seeking a full-time M&E Data Analyst to join our team. We are looking for someone eager to conduct impactful research, share their expertise, and build upon a tradition of evaluation and data excellence at NewGlobe.




The Data Analyst is responsible for supporting the data analysis of different descriptive analyses and impact evaluations within the organization. These analyses can range from simple descriptive analyses using a few Excel formulas, to more complex work using multiple Stata or R scripts. To do this, the Analyst will need to manage all parts of the data analysis process - starting from the design stage through the execution of analyses, and the reporting of the findings to other internal stakeholders.




The analyst is responsible for the provision of high-quality data products that other colleagues can rely on, and build their own work on. As such, this role is at the core of a large portion of all the M&E efforts within NewGlobe, and in consequence, at the intersection of our evaluation efforts to continually deliver stronger education to our students. We view data and analytics as core to our ability to learn as an organization. We want to cultivate data and analytics rock stars, people who produce and use data to reveal actionable insights for NewGlobe’s rapidly growing network of schools. The person in this role will receive constant coaching and mentoring from the rest of the M&E and Data Analytics team, and professional development will be a core feature of this role.




The M&E Analyst should be willing to work in Cambridge, MA. The M&E Analyst will report to the Director, M&E. Significant travel is required.




What You Will Do




Clean and analyze data sets. These data sets can be used to answer questions from a wide range of topics like academic performance, impact evaluation studies, internal RCTs, among others.
Ensure the creation of proper data pipelines and best data management practices.
Contribute to a culture of data-driven decision-making by collaborating with various team members across territories.
Accommodate requests for quick analyses. Time-sensitive questions will come from the VPs and C-Level Executives, and usually take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Oftentimes, you will need to direct your staff to use their best judgment in the face of imperfect data.
Other duties as required by the Directors and VP of M&E, and C-level executives.


What You Should Have




High data literacy and a strong background in econometrics and/or statistics. Previous experience in an academic or applied setting, such as being an analyst, research assistant, data manager, or consultant. Experience in data cleaning, analysis, and/or visualization.
A high level of proficiency with Stata or R, and Excel. Any other data analysis software or coding language is a plus. Experience with survey software like Qualtrics, SurveyCTO, or Google Forms is also a plus.
Undergraduate degree (or its equivalent) or Masters degree – in a relevant academic discipline, for example (but not limited to) Economics, Public or Education Policy, or Statistics.
Strong communication skills and the ability to translate complex ideas for non-technical audiences – you will need effective verbal and written communication skills to provide valuable insights and research reports for internal and external stakeholders.
Belief in data-driven decision making.
Flexible and loves to work in a dynamic environment.
Passion – for NewGlobe’s mission.
Bonus – experience in extreme growth situations and dealing with complexity; worked/studied in a developing country, worked in a no-excuses charter school in high-poverty areas in the U.S., and/or experience implementing data collection projects, particularly for impact evaluations.


You’re also




A detailed doer – You have a track record of getting things done. You’re organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company.
A networking mastermind – You excel at meeting new people and turning them into advocates. You communicate in a clear, conscientious, and effective way in both written and oral speech. You can influence strangers in the course of a single conversation. Allies and colleagues will go to bat for your ideas. You have an existing network from prior experience in the country, preferably in the regulatory, education, or business sectors.
A creative problem-solver – Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, NewGlobe works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand.
A relentless advocate –The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent’s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience, and value.
A malleable learner –You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you’ve missed things or failed today.
A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don’t just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.

Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience, and value. </li><li>A malleable learner –You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you’ve missed things or failed today. </li><li>A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don’t just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.</li></ul>

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). More recently, we have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and cult/challenger brands (Island Creek Oysters, Walden Local). We have a global client base with a growing local roster.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst II to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have an absolute love for data, especially search/social advertising, CRM & customer sales data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem, and living inside a spreadsheet/data set to find the answer to any question.
Because you love data, you have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, Google Data Studio/Data Visualization and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis.
You’re comfortable showing off your SQL skills and have experience with Marketing APIs, Big Query and Google Cloud Platform. Experience with other Cloud Data Warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.), ETL Tools (Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics) and/or Python are all pluses.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and have spent a minimum of 2+ years working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.




What You’ll Do:

Reporting: With your expertise in Advanced Excel, SQL, Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools, you’ll be maintaining customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence, generating pivot tables and other visualizations that summarize thousands/millions of lines of data. You should have experience in translating performance media metrics into coherent, digestible reports for client ad campaigns and be comfortable communicating via Google Slides or PowerPoint decks. You are proactive, thorough and skeptical of the data that you report on, validation is a priority for you.
Strategy: You’ll be responsible for learning our clients’ businesses and aligning their media strategy with business goals as well as understanding advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to help guide media buying strategy. With a background in paid media and/or digital advertising, you understand concepts like LTV, ROAS and Incremental Revenue and are able to be engaged in discussions with clients to gain trust and shareholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.




Gupta Media is an office-first (with flexibility) organization and we are excited to have our team working together again.

Borrowell is a Canadian company whose mission is to make financial prosperity possible for everyone.

Our data shows that Borrowell members reported up to a 100-point increase in their credit score after one year of using select Borrowell products.

Our Commitment to Applicants




Culture and Values at Zapier




Zapier Guide to Remote Work




Zapier Code of Conduct




Diversity and Inclusivity at Zapier




Zapier is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace dedicated to pursuing and hiring a diverse workforce.




Even though our job description may seem like we're looking for a specific candidate, the role inevitably ends up tailored to the person who applies and joins. Regardless of how well you feel you fit our description, we encourage you to apply if you meet the criteria below.




About You




You can build scalable web software. You’ve worked across the stack, and although you may know more about front-end development, backend web services, or cloud infrastructure, you can dive into any part of the stack and make an impact. Zapier is built on Python, Django, NextJS, Node.js, and AWS.




You are an optimizer, always seeking ways to eliminate waste and toil. You use metrics to understand where there are inefficiencies and take action to improve them. You seek out manual and repetitive processes and automate them.




You care about the developer experience. You care just as much about how we design, build and release software as you do about what customer experiences we deliver. You have previously set up and managed your team's local development environment and CI/CD pipeline.




You are an expert at knowledge sharing. You quickly share knowledge with your team when you learn something new. You write accessible technical documentation and create video content to help level up your peers. You have a track record of teaching and mentoring others.




You prefer to find (open source) or buy solutions vs. building. You know that many problems have been tackled before and seek to learn, leverage and licence from others.




You value software quality. You understand that being functionally complete is just part of delivering high-quality software — addressing maintainability, security, reliability, efficiency, and scalability are at the forefront of how you build software. You lean on automation whenever possible.




You have a systems-oriented mindset. You're inquisitive. You build a deep understanding of problems and are good at spotting patterns. You understand how to design and implement end-to-end systems.




You value our values. At Zapier, our values are at the heart of how we work together and how we think about our customers. As a remote-first company, our values help develop trust and ensure we collaborate effectively to democratize automation. You recognize how our values can empower meaningful work, you thrive in a collaborative setting, you are eager to continue growing, and you’re excited to be part of the team.




Things You Might Do




That Said, Here Are Some Things You'll Probably Do




Zapier is a fast-growing, remote-first company. You'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization.




Engage with engineers directly and use metrics to understand pain points in the developer journey and implement various solutions including patterns, tooling and guidance to help address these.
Teach and share knowledge by creating how-to guides, articles, videos and technical documentation.
Improve GitLab CI/CD pipelines to reduce lead time for changes and increase reliability.
Evolve our internal developer platform (IDP) capabilities, such as how we use feature toggles for experimentation and feature rollout
Drive improvements to engineering onboarding, helping new folks get up and running faster and easier.
You actively contribute to the team roadmap — you help write, refine and prioritize a backlog of actionable deliverables.
As a part of Zapier's all-hands philosophy , help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible.

Data Engineer – 12 months – rate open to negotiation – City of London (hybrid)




You will be expected to build an excellent knowledge of the companies products with a deep understanding of how we build and deploy our applications/ETLs.

The position involves understanding the current data stack and data pipelines. This will involve supporting their day-to-day execution, responding to urgent production issues and assisting other teams. It will also require involvement in identifying improvements and planning their implementation. These could range from simple evolutionary improvements to existing processes and tools to the adoption of a whole new stack.

Data Engineer – This is a project role again. From a Data Engineering perspective, this is a greenfield project where we are considering a whole new approach. It’s critical to find this skillset – someone who can build self-service data engineering type platform. The stack to do this is currently an unknown and we want to find someone to come in and help us build the business case for what the stack is/should be. Business case is already there – this is about designing the architecture and thinking about “what is the right way to do it?”. We get mixed quality data from insurers so are looking for someone to help us select the right product where it would be easier to take in the data and to get it into a single consistent format where it is automated as much as possible. - AWS, ETL, Kubernetes

Our interview process:

Your first conversation with Feeld will be a screening call with our recruiter, where you’ll be able to ask - and receive answers - regarding any general questions you have and to confirm the role is a fit for what you’re seeking.
Your second conversation will connect you directly with the hiring manager for the role you’re applying to. Here, you’ll have a chance to ask more questions about the work you’ll be doing. This conversation will also focus on your past work experiences.
The next step for most of our roles is a candidate challenge. This is an evaluation of the skills relevant to be successful in this role and generally takes about an hour to complete.
Your third conversation allows you the opportunity to meet the team members you might be working with on a daily basis. Here, you’ll be able to ask questions about team processes, workflow, and the employee experience at Feeld.
We generally make an offer within 2 weeks of our final call, and offer a flexible start date that can begin as early as the next Monday after you sign our offer documentation.

Having a good knowledge of current data protection legislation to ensure that all outputs are fully compliant with all GDPR requirements.
Ensuring best practice is followed through maintaining comprehensive documentation and being involved in project reviews to identify and embed learning for future projects.




Who are we looking for?




In addition to possessing the suitable skills and experience to deliver against the above responsibilities, to be successful you’ll also need to:




Have a strong interest in data analytics and data visualisation
Care about quality and getting it right by having a keen eye for detail and taking pride in what you do
Be a great team player who can build effective working relationships while also being happy to work autonomously when required
Have good written and verbal communication skills so you can communicate effectively with a range of stakeholders in a clear, confident and collaborative manner

Global technology companies use incident.io to empower teams to run incidents from start to finish, by getting the right people involved in real-time on Slack.

Our platform integrates with tools you already use, with intuitive workflows and guiding actions to support your team through tough situations. Auto-generated timelines and post-mortems eliminate busy work and focuses effort on high impact work.

Rapidly fix and learn from incidents, so you can build more resilient products.

The Team

At incident.io data is involved in everything we do: from product launches and core dashboards we run the company with, to dashboards embedded in our product that have become hugely valuable for our customers to gain insights from their incident data.

We collect a variety of data both internally (product usage) and externally (social media, Google Analytics, Stripe, Finance & Sales tools), and we're really proud of the data stack we've built so far (and updated). Our data stack consists of Google BigQuery, Fivetran, dbt, and Metabase.

We're a 2 person Data team, covering everything across Product, Go to Market (Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success), Finance, and Talent. This role will focus on supporting our Go to Market (GTM) function as it triples in size this year.

Think of this role as being a hybrid of a Data Analyst and an Analytics Engineer. You'll be involved in everything from data pipelines to creating dashboards and presenting analysis. This is expected of everyone in the team until we start to specialise more as we grow.

What you'll be doing:

Supporting our GTM projects: such as tracking customer health, improving revenue generation, and analysing our signup funnel. The scope of this will increase a lot as the GTM function expands and it's an exciting time to join!
Contributing to our dbt codebase: owning GTM data models such as pipeline forecasting and the feed of Product data into our Sales tools, as well as contributing to our core data models
Communicating data across the business: we use Metabase dashboards, analysis write-ups, insights sharing in our weekly all-hands, and Smiirls!
Performing deep dive analysis: it's important to us as a team that we have the time to dive into topics we think might have a big impact on the business
Understanding our product: even though this role won't involve working directly with our Product function, it will be very hands on with our Product data


This role could be ideal for you if you:

Have worked in data analytics, science, or engineering for 2-4 years, ideally in a fast growing start-up or scale-up environment
Have a strong grasp of SQL, including window functions and creating gapless date tables
Have hands on experience with dbt - particularly building robust data pipelines that are well documented and tested
Can present analysis in a clear, convincing way that gets across the ""so what?"" to someone non-technical
Prioritise by whatever is going to have the most impact for the business, and understand when to hack something together vs. when to spend time on the detail


Our commitment to diversity

We embrace diversity at incident.io, and believe in creating supportive and inclusive environments where all of our employees can succeed. To build a product that's loved by everyone, we need a team with all kinds of different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds. That's why we're committed to hiring people regardless of race, religion, colour, national origin, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, age, neurodiversity status, disability status, or otherwise.

You are joining a small team at the early stages of our greenfield journey. We are looking for someone who is ready and willing to roll sleeves up and get stuck into setting up our data management capabilities. You will have experience with the journey to build up a modern data framework and with your drive and innovation you are ready to deliver data management and data quality for the business.

Who We Are

GWI was founded with the knowledge that understanding your audience is really important for business. When you know who you’re speaking to and why, you can create content and campaigns that stand out to the people that matter.

Through our global online survey, we gather data on the behaviour and perceptions of consumers across the world. This provides businesses with deep, actionable insights on their audience, revealed from data they trust.

It’s been going well, too. Since launching in 2009, we’ve become one of the UK’s fastest growing target audience companies. We’re not about to stop growing any time soon. As a business, we’re on a mission to re-engineer data-driven marketing, and we’re on the lookout for talented people to join us.

Diversity & Inclusion

Imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. We’d get a very nuanced view of the world. And we definitely wouldn’t have got off the ground as a business.

Although things certainly aren’t perfect, we live in a society where differences are increasingly celebrated – so we’d expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, it’s really important to us that it stays that way. This is a place to feel at home, express yourself freely and make your mark.

Implemented best practices and streamlined our processes. You've optimised data collection systems, enabling more efficient data analysis and enhanced digital performance. Across clients, you've provided developers with clear instructions for analytics implementation, supported QA pre-release, and monitored post-launch to ensure everything is coming in smoothly.
Illustrated the possibilities of data visualisation. You've found innovative ways to capture, manipulate, and display data, uncovering new insights and driving innovative product development. In addition, you've helped the creative team to showcase data to fans in new ways, enhancing player profiles, match centres, and statistics across client products.
