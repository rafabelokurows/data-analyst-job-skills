At Span, we are building products to drive the rapid adoption of renewable energy by designing the infrastructure for a distributed, renewable grid. Our smart panel reinvents home electrical systems as part of the distributed grid and makes user-friendly renewable energy at the center of the smart home, presenting intelligent load-balancing and revolutionary edge-of-grid controls to homeowners through the Span mobile app.

The Team

The Research and Development Org is the driving force behind SPAN's technology. The team designs and completes a wide range of test setups and experiments, crafting a pathway that will best meet the needs at hand and moving collectively and independently across department constraints. The Eccles Lab facility is solely focused on implementing the vision and practical application of existing and new product testing and development.

The Role

We aim to establish the SPAN panel as the center of home energy and the backbone of the renewable distributed grid. As Data Analyst leader on our team, you will define the strategy for information flows and insights around the company. You will support company leaders by providing access to strategic information, and being a thought-partner in defining and tracking KPI's. You will also support our hardware and software product teams by structuring our dashboards to help them identify issues and opportunities.

The job responsibilities include:

Designing, implementing and monitoring metrics
Ensuring engagement and adoption of dashboards and fostering a culture of data-driven decisions
Leading the design and execution of the communication of information to stakeholders on all levels
Building scalable solutions to help software and hardware teams to identify and investigate issues
Automating information flows by using data pipelines, dashboards, and reports
Being a thought leader and implementation partner to the product development teams


Note: We're a startup, so while this list is broad, it's still just a start; you'll end up wearing many hats during your time at Span.

About You

Bachelor's degree or higher in Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering, or a closely related field.
5+ years' professional experience doing data analysis and dashboards on large data sets

The U.S. base salary range for this position is $125,600 - $148,700 plus benefits, equity and variable compensation for Sales-related roles. This range represents SPAN's good faith estimate of competitively-priced salary for the role based on national, real-time industry data from companies of a similar growth stage. This range reflects minimum and maximum new hire salaries for the role across US locations. Within the range, individual pay is determined by location and individual factors including relevant skills, experience and education or training. This range correlates to the relative level of the candidate we believe we need for the role and may require an adjustment for candidates of a different level.

Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for the location this role is based during the hiring process.

Intelligence Specialist (PowerBI Dev.),Global Pharma Tek,"Toronto, Ontario, Canada","Description




As part of the modernization of Social Assistance (SA) reporting platform (Legacy Cognos system), conduct a review of existing data model(s), report model(s) and redesign reporting products to be scalable and flexible to meet current program and Ministry needs for analytical and operational reporting.




The SA program area has identified several data and reporting products to support their efforts to modernize service delivery and streamline partnerships with municipalities. As the SA program area continues to develop the operational model implementation and evaluation plans, BIPD needs to establish a modernized, flexible reporting model to support reporting products and requirements. This will result in development of net new data and reporting products, including products to support Service Planning, continuous monitoring of operational indicators and outcome data through the contract cycle. At the same time BIPD needs to address the development of products in the SA reporting backlog, and the rationalization of the current 160+ operational and analytical products in the reporting catalogue.




Purpose




To integrate, translate and oversee design of business-driven issues and priorities into enterprise-level business intelligence and data analytics solutions, using leading-edge data development approaches, with expertise/knowledge in data modelling, data architecture and infrastructure, data development (including dimensional modelling) as well as reporting (e.g. dashboard) development.




To project-manage (e.g. design, deliver and implement) complex I&IT projects and various agile, business solutions required to meet cross-ministry business intelligence and data analytics activities and priority projects, including leading and supporting enterprise-wide projects that may involve work with other ministries, jurisdictions and the broader public sector.




To work within the ministry's business analytics data warehouse environment, and support efforts to enhance and maintain infrastructure and applications, and providing technical expertise to the development and implementation of various I&IT solutions, while working with CYSSC, ITS and enterprise partners.




To lead data development and maintenance activities that support strategic initiatives and priority projects across the ministry, including the preparation of ad-hoc statistical information and developing research/analytical data for reporting and analytics, while ensuring appropriate data quality, integrity, privacy and security.

PolicyMap is a national online mapping tool and platform that enables its customers to access data about communities and markets across the US. It is used for research, market studies, business planning, site selection, grant applications and impact analysis. We offer access to the PolicyMap tool through subscriptions and enterprise access, license the underlying data in our platform and help organizations and companies bring interactive mapping to their own websites. Launched in 2008, PolicyMap now has hundreds of customers, including federal, state, and local government agencies, major universities, non-profit organizations, and commercial firms spanning real estate, banking, and health care. PolicyMap is a Benefit Corporation founded on the belief that data has the power to change communities and markets.




The Data Development Team at PolicyMap is responsible for the collection, curation, maintenance, and updates of source data for PolicyMap’s core products. We build tools, processes, and documentation to clean, organize, annotate, and integrate terabytes of data from hundreds of unique sources for PolicyMap’s customers. Data format, structure, and update cadence all vary widely, so we build our infrastructure to be flexible and to reflect this reality.




PolicyMap is also embarking on an enterprise-wide infrastructure migration initiative aimed at scalability, and the Data Development Team is playing a key role in setting requirements for new tools for collecting, processing, and transferring data.
