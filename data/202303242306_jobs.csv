At Span, we are building products to drive the rapid adoption of renewable energy by designing the infrastructure for a distributed, renewable grid. Our smart panel reinvents home electrical systems as part of the distributed grid and makes user-friendly renewable energy at the center of the smart home, presenting intelligent load-balancing and revolutionary edge-of-grid controls to homeowners through the Span mobile app.

The Team

The Research and Development Org is the driving force behind SPAN's technology. The team designs and completes a wide range of test setups and experiments, crafting a pathway that will best meet the needs at hand and moving collectively and independently across department constraints. The Eccles Lab facility is solely focused on implementing the vision and practical application of existing and new product testing and development.

The Role

We aim to establish the SPAN panel as the center of home energy and the backbone of the renewable distributed grid. As Data Analyst leader on our team, you will define the strategy for information flows and insights around the company. You will support company leaders by providing access to strategic information, and being a thought-partner in defining and tracking KPI's. You will also support our hardware and software product teams by structuring our dashboards to help them identify issues and opportunities.

The job responsibilities include:

Designing, implementing and monitoring metrics
Ensuring engagement and adoption of dashboards and fostering a culture of data-driven decisions
Leading the design and execution of the communication of information to stakeholders on all levels
Building scalable solutions to help software and hardware teams to identify and investigate issues
Automating information flows by using data pipelines, dashboards, and reports
Being a thought leader and implementation partner to the product development teams


Note: We're a startup, so while this list is broad, it's still just a start; you'll end up wearing many hats during your time at Span.

About You

The U.S. base salary range for this position is $125,600 - $148,700 plus benefits, equity and variable compensation for Sales-related roles. This range represents SPAN's good faith estimate of competitively-priced salary for the role based on national, real-time industry data from companies of a similar growth stage. This range reflects minimum and maximum new hire salaries for the role across US locations. Within the range, individual pay is determined by location and individual factors including relevant skills, experience and education or training. This range correlates to the relative level of the candidate we believe we need for the role and may require an adjustment for candidates of a different level.

Intelligence Specialist (PowerBI Dev.),Global Pharma Tek,"Toronto, Ontario, Canada","Description




As part of the modernization of Social Assistance (SA) reporting platform (Legacy Cognos system), conduct a review of existing data model(s), report model(s) and redesign reporting products to be scalable and flexible to meet current program and Ministry needs for analytical and operational reporting.




The SA program area has identified several data and reporting products to support their efforts to modernize service delivery and streamline partnerships with municipalities. As the SA program area continues to develop the operational model implementation and evaluation plans, BIPD needs to establish a modernized, flexible reporting model to support reporting products and requirements. This will result in development of net new data and reporting products, including products to support Service Planning, continuous monitoring of operational indicators and outcome data through the contract cycle. At the same time BIPD needs to address the development of products in the SA reporting backlog, and the rationalization of the current 160+ operational and analytical products in the reporting catalogue.




Purpose




To integrate, translate and oversee design of business-driven issues and priorities into enterprise-level business intelligence and data analytics solutions, using leading-edge data development approaches, with expertise/knowledge in data modelling, data architecture and infrastructure, data development (including dimensional modelling) as well as reporting (e.g. dashboard) development.




To project-manage (e.g. design, deliver and implement) complex I&IT projects and various agile, business solutions required to meet cross-ministry business intelligence and data analytics activities and priority projects, including leading and supporting enterprise-wide projects that may involve work with other ministries, jurisdictions and the broader public sector.




To work within the ministry's business analytics data warehouse environment, and support efforts to enhance and maintain infrastructure and applications, and providing technical expertise to the development and implementation of various I&IT solutions, while working with CYSSC, ITS and enterprise partners.




To lead data development and maintenance activities that support strategic initiatives and priority projects across the ministry, including the preparation of ad-hoc statistical information and developing research/analytical data for reporting and analytics, while ensuring appropriate data quality, integrity, privacy and security.

PolicyMap is a national online mapping tool and platform that enables its customers to access data about communities and markets across the US. It is used for research, market studies, business planning, site selection, grant applications and impact analysis. We offer access to the PolicyMap tool through subscriptions and enterprise access, license the underlying data in our platform and help organizations and companies bring interactive mapping to their own websites. Launched in 2008, PolicyMap now has hundreds of customers, including federal, state, and local government agencies, major universities, non-profit organizations, and commercial firms spanning real estate, banking, and health care. PolicyMap is a Benefit Corporation founded on the belief that data has the power to change communities and markets.




The Data Development Team at PolicyMap is responsible for the collection, curation, maintenance, and updates of source data for PolicyMap’s core products. We build tools, processes, and documentation to clean, organize, annotate, and integrate terabytes of data from hundreds of unique sources for PolicyMap’s customers. Data format, structure, and update cadence all vary widely, so we build our infrastructure to be flexible and to reflect this reality.




PolicyMap is also embarking on an enterprise-wide infrastructure migration initiative aimed at scalability, and the Data Development Team is playing a key role in setting requirements for new tools for collecting, processing, and transferring data.

Hey, I'm Kuvera, the COO and Co-Founder at HowNow, and I’m hiring! Before I tell you more about our role, here’s a bit more about us…




Our mission is to make meaningful learning a part of your everyday work! 🧠




The shelf life of our skills is now less than 5 years. So, if you stopped learning today, you’d soon end up irrelevant. Think that’s a big problem? You’d be right.




Enter HowNow. Founded in 2019, this is the problem our Learning Experience Platform is solving. It’s disrupting the way people learn and grow at work through technology. Whether it's finding a quick answer, building a skill, or tapping into shared knowledge, we make it easy for people to learn what they need, when they need it.




On the back of our Series-A funding, the next stage of our ambitious journey begins. Already used by fast-growing scale-ups and global enterprises, such as Checkout.com, Depop and Investec, we’re pushing the boundaries of how people learn.




""Data & Insights"" as a function at HowNow, hasn't previously existed, until now. As our first hire, your job will be to build out what Data Analysis looks like. We've already identified that there's an enormous amount of potential that this role can bring to the table. You'll provide key analysis and insights of our product that will allow our customers to have conversations they've previously never been able to have. Sound exciting? It is. You'll also partner with teams internally - Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, and Finance are just a few areas where we can see you'll be able to make a massive impact, but we're sure you'll spot other ways to add value as you go!

💡 Access to the very best learning platform out there (HowNow+) to keep you at the top of your game




📚 An annual £500 learning and development budget




🌴 25 days holiday, plus bank holidays and your birthday day off

Once you've applied, we'll get back in touch with you. This is usually within the next 3 working days. Sometimes it can take slightly longer, but we will get back to you as soon as we can, irregardless of what the outcome of your application is.




If we've decided it's a match, you'll be invited to a 30-minute video call with Dom, our Senior Talent Partner.




After the initial call, if we're both interested in moving ahead, you'll be invited to meet with Kuvera, our COO & Co-Founder for 45 minutes so you can get to know each other better.

Your second conversation will connect you directly with the hiring manager for the role you’re applying to. Here, you’ll have a chance to ask more questions about the work you’ll be doing. This conversation will also focus on your past work experiences.
The next step for most of our roles is a candidate challenge. This is an evaluation of the skills relevant to be successful in this role and generally takes about an hour to complete.
Your third conversation allows you the opportunity to meet the team members you might be working with on a daily basis. Here, you’ll be able to ask questions about team processes, workflow, and the employee experience at Feeld.
We generally make an offer within 2 weeks of our final call, and offer a flexible start date that can begin as early as the next Monday after you sign our offer documentation.

Hi, I’m Simon, our Chief Operating Officer at Mention Me and I’m hiring! Before I tell you more about the role, here's a little bit about Mention Me and what we do.

Becoming a Mentioneer means you’ll be joining our Referral Engineering® movement, which is changing the world of marketing.

Our data-driven referral marketing platform equips brands to drive growth through their fans by encouraging and rewarding personal recommendations.

There’s a good chance you’ve already come across us while online shopping from Puma, Michael Kors, ASOS, Ray Ban, or any other of the 450+ brands we work with.

We’ve delivered more than 5.5m referrals totalling $1.5bn in revenue for our clients.

Now, our mission to make all brands think advocacy-first is stepping up a gear, and you might be just who we need to help us.

The Role

We’re looking for a Data and Insight analyst to join our business, to make sure we’re on top of all the data we use to run the business. You’ll work closely with the finance team, revenue operations and leadership across the business to make sure everyone’s got the data they need at their fingertips. You’ll wrangle datasets into shape, build dashboards and answer a huge array of questions, exploring new hypotheses and generating ideas for what we can learn to improve what we do.

You’ll be joining Mention Me at an exciting time when we’re expanding the business into new geographies and new products. We’ve also put data right at the heart of our core product, so there’s an in-house data science team you can learn modern ML and data science techniques from.

What you’ll do:

Take on responsibility for our existing data warehouse and dashboarding (built in Looker and BigQuery)
Build new dashboards and reports for leaders in the business so that they have access to the data they need to make informed decisions
Make sure all our data is accurate and consistent and available
Field all manner of questions that will require you to explore the data available, visualise it in new ways and prove or disprove hypotheses
Integrate new data sources into our data warehouse


We'd really like to hear from you, if…

You have at least 3 years’ experience of looking after data and analytics in a business/finance context (ideally in a Martech and SaaS business)
Your attention to detail is exemplary, and you never let a discrepancy go unfixed
You can work well across a range of different stakeholders, capturing and prioritising their requirements and delivering against the commitments you make for them
You have experience of creating and managing reporting and dashboarding (ideally using Looker)
You love being hands-on in a scale up environment.


What you’ll get:

Here are some of our favourite perks and benefits, but we have so many more!

🏡 Remote and Hybrid working. We're opening our Boston office very soon, stay tuned.

🧠 Free mental well-being support with a qualified therapist through Spill

📚 An annual learning and development budget

🤲🏾 2 Celebration Days: additional time off for you to celebrate religious days, cultural events, birthdays, anniversaries, or any other significant day that’s important to you

👨‍👩‍👧 Enhanced parental leave

🌴 20 days holiday plus public holidays, alongside additional days for being a Mentioneer

🏆 Monthly prizes for being amazing! Values Awards and Customer Love awards, and Founders’ Award for Awesomeness. Win up to £500 cash, vouchers, meals out and trips away.

🤩 Regular social events, from chocolate-tasting and pottery-making to poker nights and picnics

💻 All the up-to-date tech you’ll need (we love Macs)

👩🏾‍⚕️ Major medical, dental, vision, and life insurance policies.

🫶🏼 Short and long-term disability support

Diversity, equity and inclusion

We celebrate every Mentioneer, exactly as they are. We don’t shy away from breaking down systemic discrimination in society, or from difficult conversations and decisions. We’re committed to being a force for change. You can read more about how we’re doing this and always learning, by looking at our blogs here.

The same goes for our recruitment. We welcome every application, regardless of race, religion or belief, ethnic origin, physical ability, family structure, socioeconomic status, age, nationality or citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation or gender identity. If you’d like to find out more about diversity and inclusion at Mention Me, get in touch.

Who We Are

Each year U.S. households spend over $4.6 trillion - about one third of all consumer spending - on recurring bill payments. While staying on top of these bills is the single largest determinant for consumer financial health, organizing and paying them can be a time-consuming and frustrating chore. Since its inception, doxo has been on a mission to simplify and reduce the anxiety of staying on top of bills, empowering consumers to improve their financial health. Our company was founded on the simple idea that there should be an easy and more secure way for consumers to pay all of their bills through a single account, with any payment method, on any device.

As consumers shift more bill payments online and to mobile, doxo continues to experience rapid growth. To date, over eight million doxo users across 97% of U.S. zip codes have paid bills through the payment network, across more than 45 different service categories. With more than 130,000 payable billers, doxo’s proprietary, crowd sourced provider directory is the largest in the nation.

In 2021, doxo was named by both BuiltIn and Comparably as a best place to work in Seattle, and was also recognized by both Inc. Magazine and Deloitte as one of the fastest-growing companies in North America. Come join us as we grow the team to further accelerate growth, forever changing the bill pay landscape to focus on the customer.

WHY WE ARE DIFFERENT

doxo is unique in that we have already found product/market fit and that our service is filling an important market need every day. But we are still small enough that every employee, no matter their position, can make a meaningful impact. Because transparency is a priority at all levels across the organization, we are all aware of how our work contributes to the success of our business as a whole. We are agile and work hard to solve difficult problems quickly. We work as a team to get things done and mentor individuals to get to the next level in their career.

100% employer-paid medical, dental, and vision coverage for full-time employees
Generous equity grants
401k match to help you save for your future
15 days PTO to start, plus paid holidays

Additional Information




Early morning. Campo 24 de Agosto. In 4 minutes, you are clocking in at the office. After grabbing a cup of coffee and fresh fruit, pick up your laptop and choose your spot for the day. It's going to be a busy one: French class before lunch and, just after, quick medical appointment at Natixis doctor's office.




Lunch break. Outside in the big terrace (look at your crops at the Urban Garden; ready to harvest!) or, if you feel like stretching your legs, walk downtown to grab lunch.




Back inside. Quick sprint review (working together anywhere means virtual happy birthday to that colleague in Paris that just turned 35). The afternoon went flying (tasks, reports, calls, some jokes with your teammates). End it on a high note: just one PlayStation game or the final match for that ping-pong tournament.




Tomorrow, you complete that certified technical training and the day after, you will work from home, taking advantage to finally do that online course on Udemy. Once you are done with your tasks for the day, you can visit the office for a board games session or show up at the rehearsal of one of Natixis bands. If that is too steady for you, meet your colleagues to surf some waves or join them in a football match.

Quick sprint review (working together anywhere means virtual happy birthday to that colleague in Paris that just turned 35). The afternoon went flying (tasks, reports, calls, some jokes with your teammates). End it on a high note: just one PlayStation game or the final match for that ping-pong tournament.<p><br></p>Tomorrow, you complete that certified technical training and the day after, you will work from home, taking advantage to finally do that online course on Udemy. Once you are done with your tasks for the day, you can visit the office for a board games session or show up at the rehearsal of one of Natixis bands. If that is too steady for you, meet your colleagues to surf some waves or join them in a football match.

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?




We do not believe in hiring consultants. Imagine taking your car to the repair shop for a fix, and they only have a consulting mechanic who recommends that you replace your carburetor. Who is going to do that? When we have problems with our business, we value people who can fix them and not just make pitch decks and general recommendations.




Trilogy has an ever-growing portfolio of 80+ software products spanning multiple industries and geographies. We have different business units that own these products, and Trilogy hosts business-critical functions such as finance, customer support, and hiring for all these business units. In this role, you will work with the senior stakeholders across the business units and functions to help solve the problems they face. For instance, you may work with the SVP of Finance to hire qualified accountants in one week and work with the CIO to evaluate M&A targets using a scalable model the following week.




We are looking for exceptional problem solvers and brilliant thinkers to join our team. Unlike other companies, we do not judge you by arbitrary stamps, such as whether you graduated from X university or worked in a 'top' consulting firm. We want problem solvers who enjoy taking on the challenge of solving complex problems, dive deep to find the root causes of these issues, and propose and implement fixes that solve them.




If you are interested in solving complex problems while gaining unparalleled experience working across business functions and units, apply today!




What You Will Be Doing




Conduct research and analysis to find creative solutions for issues with real business impact.
Execute assignments aiming to improve the efficiency of different functions, such as Operations, Hiring, M&A, and more.




What You Won’t Be Doing




Provide high-level insights and recommendations - we want implementers, not consultants.
Develop theoretical scenarios and try to sell potential insights to management - you will work on real business problems with real solutions.




Data Analyst Key Responsibilities




Solve the most complex issues facing the organization.




Basic Requirements




Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Economics, Finance, Mathematics, Engineering).
5+ years of work experience.
Interest in solving real-world problems across a broad range of functions.

Who are we?




Klue is a VC backed, capital-efficient high growth SaaS. Tiger Global and Salesforce Ventures led our US$62m Series B in the fall of 2021.

We benefit from having an experienced leadership team working alongside several hundred risk-taking builders who elevate every day.




We’re one of Canada’s Most Admired Corporate Cultures by Waterstone HC, a Deloitte Technology Fast 50 & Fast 500 winner, and recipient of both the Startup of the Year and Tech Culture of the Year awards at the Technology Impact Awards.




The Insights' team scope covers data validation for existing sources, outsourced content, and new potential data sources. This role is focused on quality checks at scale and you will be key in ensuring that our data providers and outsourced content creators are delivering high-quality content that is linked back to source data. As the data marketplace is always evolving, you will also be involved in POC's of new data sources that can support manual curation initiatives.




This is You:




Highly analytical and critical thinker
Ability to digest and communicate complex data
You like ambiguity and thrive in fast-paced environments
You are an Excel and/or Python master
Strong communicator and natural networker
You like to learn new things and are keen to become an expert

If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.




We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.




All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?




We do not believe in hiring consultants. Imagine taking your car to the repair shop for a fix, and they only have a consulting mechanic who recommends that you replace your carburetor. Who is going to do that? When we have problems with our business, we value people who can fix them and not just make pitch decks and general recommendations.




Trilogy has an ever-growing portfolio of 80+ software products spanning multiple industries and geographies. We have different business units that own these products, and Trilogy hosts business-critical functions such as finance, customer support, and hiring for all these business units. In this role, you will work with the senior stakeholders across the business units and functions to help solve the problems they face. For instance, you may work with the SVP of Finance to hire qualified accountants in one week and work with the CIO to evaluate M&A targets using a scalable model the following week.




We are looking for exceptional problem solvers and brilliant thinkers to join our team. Unlike other companies, we do not judge you by arbitrary stamps, such as whether you graduated from X university or worked in a 'top' consulting firm. We want problem solvers who enjoy taking on the challenge of solving complex problems, dive deep to find the root causes of these issues, and propose and implement fixes that solve them.




If you are interested in solving complex problems while gaining unparalleled experience working across business functions and units, apply today!




What You Will Be Doing




Conduct research and analysis to find creative solutions for issues with real business impact.
Execute assignments aiming to improve the efficiency of different functions, such as Operations, Hiring, M&A, and more.




What You Won’t Be Doing




Provide high-level insights and recommendations - we want implementers, not consultants.
Develop theoretical scenarios and try to sell potential insights to management - you will work on real business problems with real solutions.




Data Analyst Key Responsibilities




Solve the most complex issues facing the organization.




Basic Requirements




Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Economics, Finance, Mathematics, Engineering).
5+ years of work experience.
Interest in solving real-world problems across a broad range of functions.

What You Will Be Doing

Jr Data Analyst BI & Reporting – BI (Openbank) 1-year training contrac

We are the 100% digital bank of the Santander Group and we are currently undergoing a technological transformation and international expansion process. In 2017, we kicked off our relaunch plans and have been continuously expanding and growing ever since, especially when it comes to technology. We work in a start-up format, using agile methodologies to take our customers' experience to the next level. In 2019, we launched in the Netherlands, Germany and Portugal, recently followed by Argentina, with other countries currently in the pipeline.

Our culture sets us apart from the rest; social and diversity clubs are part of our essence and day-to-day culture.

We are a flexible and fast adapting team currently working remotely most of the time using all kinds of communication tools – we’ve barely noticed the change!

Mission and responsibilities:

As a Data Analyst, you will maintain and build reports for different business areas, such as Onboarding, Wealth, or Zinia.

The main tasks of this position will be the following:

Collecting and interpreting data from different sources in our AWS Datalake.
Analysing results from different commercial actions and drive insights that can lead to optimizing our business.
Reporting the results back to the relevant members of the business, using data visualization tools.
Identifying patterns and trends in data sets, as well as automate these tasks so we can spend less time reviwing normality and more time analyzing interesting anomalous patterns.
Defining new data collection and analysis processes from our different business verticals, such as wealth, insurance, or new countries.
Locate and define new process improvement opportunities.
Ability to identify and automate recurring tasks (through scripts or dashboards).
Create a repository of key queries (really useful queries could be interesting for the rest of the team and for your future work).
Generate documentation of all the processes to facilitate their understanding, transfer or backup.


To be successful in the role you must have experience on:

+2 years of experience in a similar role.
Statistical analysis: you know the basic statistical concepts, and know how to implement them in different programming languages (ideally R, Python or Spark). You know when to use different indicators and have experience summarizing data insights with them.
Dealing with large datasets, and implementing scalable solutions. You know what data cleaning means and how to interact with a data engineer.
How to solve problems using data: analyze the problem and decompose it into different analytical components, and recycle all the components you can from other projects.
Software development: you know what git means, and how to develop your own code, test it and use it to produce actionable results. Open-source lovers get a plus if you show us your github!
Data Visualization, and tools like ggplot, matplotlib, tableau, or similar. Bonus points for Microstrategy, or QuickSight.
You are an SQL-ninja, writing simple exploratory or efficient queries won't be a problem for you.


Moreover, we need that:

You can give and take criticism well. You don’t get defensive when your ideas are challenged, and you have to be polite enough to challenge others´ ideas.
You are confident but not arrogant. You ask for help when you need it. When they don’t know something they just say so. You value and celebrate the contributions of others.
You get things done. You collaboratively create thoughtful plans, communicate them to others, hustle to get resources, and then execute. You are organized. You strongly favor simple and elegant solutions over complex ones.
You don’t freak out when things go wrong. Who wants to work for someone who is constantly in a panic?
You can think at different altitudes. That is, you are equally comfortable dealing with both the big picture and the fine details.
You are superb communicator. You explain your ideas clearly and succinctly. You ask others for input. You listen carefully. You build on the ideas of others. Your presentations are not death by PowerPoint.
Transparency is one of your main cards. You enjoy sharing your knowledge.
You are a team player.


What do we offer?

Joining a dynamic and agile company undergoing international expansion.
Working in start-up mode with the support of the Santander Group.
Competitive remuneration and attractive benefits package.
Possibility of growth within the company and the Group.
Collaborating on international projects in different countries.
Excellent work environment, social clubs and frequent events (virtual at present).


Would you like to grow with us? Join our team!

We are looking for a native-level Spanish speaker with excellent knowledge of Spanish culture and language references. You must also be completely fluent in written and spoken English.

Ideally, you’re an entrepreneurial self-starter, who has a passion for identifying and delivering insights that drive business decisions. We are looking for you if you normally ask yourself “so what?” to everything. Experience in social media analysis and a basic knowledge of social media query development would be a plus, but not mandatory as we will provide ongoing training on new social media platforms, channels and social analytics techniques.

Beyond social media analysis, experience in other digital research methodologies is also a plus (i.e. online focus groups, online surveys, digital analytics, and content analysis).

Have you worked in an agency? That would also be another great point in your favour, although not mandatory.

You will work translating business questions into digital and social media solutions, developing methodologies that utilise the range of analytical techniques available across the market. Understanding client needs and finding solutions will be key to your work and you will love going deep to surface compelling qualitative and quantitative insights.

You will be part of a global team.

This role is based in Spain and you will be working mostly from home. However, we ask that you meet with your line manager (also based in Madrid) at least once a week in a co-working space to work together. For the first few weeks, so as to be fully embedded in the company and clients, we might ask you to meet with your line manager more regularly (2-3 times a week).

Requirements

You must speak and write both English and Spanish fluently. You should understand both the language and context of Spain with ease.

You must have a BA/BS or equivalent undergraduate degree or equivalent practical experience.
