Want to make an impact? Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.




We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.




Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, we work closely with our teams in Barcelona, London, San Antonio, Spokane and remote locations. We’ve got a reputation for being a great place to work, having been named among the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Seattle Business Magazine and Washington’s Best Workplaces in the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies.




At Rover, our furry coworkers are just as important as our human ones—and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Along with making the joys of pet parenthood more accessible, we’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community of pet people—and that starts with our employees.




Who we're looking for:




The Marketing & Business Analytics team supports the company’s marketing efforts, while also working with teams throughout the organization. The analytics team is responsible for a number of business-critical reports and data models that our global marketing teams rely on for daily reporting, budgeting, and analysis. Our team actively drives business value through partnering with stakeholders across the marketing and product organizations to influence the long term strategy of new customer acquisition. We lean into ambiguity to scale the business and push the boundaries of performance marketing at Rover.




We are specifically looking for a Business Analyst to support our SEO and Referral programs by designing and implementing A/B tests, working with product managers to create project and testing roadmaps, and curating key performance indicators to help narrate trends in the business. This analyst will act as a trusted business partner to the SEO and Referral teams, helping ensure the success of the programs as a whole. The ideal candidate will have an understanding of testing best-practices as well as the ability to build consensus across the organization.




Your Responsibilties:




Design and implement A/B tests to measure the impact of product investments in SEO and Referral
Invest in data infrastructure improvements to accelerate the throughput of our product experiments and make data insights more available and actionable
Contribute to forecasting exercises to set expectations for the conversion growth trends of our SEO and Referral programs
Create and refine key performance indicators to help measure the health of our business
Act as the single analyst within this domain – you will be the sole analyst dedicated to these projects. You will partner closely with the product team to develop narratives to explain recent trends and opportunities
Share insights with leadership across the organization to build awareness and consensus on upcoming project roadmaps





Your Qualifications:




At least 3 years experience working cross-functionally with complex datasets to support organizational decision making
A college degree in a quantitative or technical field (e.g., math, data science, statistics, business)
Fluency in SQL. You would feel confident reviewing code produced by analyst and data scientist peers, as well as assisting non-technical colleagues with their reports in an office hours setting
Proven capabilities with A/B testing and statistical analysis. Ability to build regressions (ordinary and weighted least squares, causal impacts) to measure the outcomes of marketing experiments. Hands-on experience owning experiments from the initial design stages to curating test readouts
Skilled at working in Mode, Tableau, Looker, or similar data visualization tools
Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Specifically, you know how to narrate models and results to business partners in a useful, concise, and meaningful way
Experience working with cross-functional business partners to define business problems, scope project deliverables/timelines, implement reporting solutions, and frame organizational strategy





Nice to Have:




Two-sided marketplace analytics experience and/or product analytics experience
Hands-on experience processing large data sets with Python. You might also have experience with R, as well as frameworks like Spark, Hive, or dbt.
Familiarity with AWS (Redshift, S3, EMR) or similar cloud products
Experience working in an analytics team within a growth stage company
Eagerness to mentor junior associates in the analytics organization





Benefits of working for Rover:




Competitive compensation
401k Match
Equity
Flexible PTO
Competitive benefits package, including medical, dental, and vision insurance
Commuter benefits
Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time)
Pet benefits, including $1,000 toward adopting your first dog or cat
Stocked fridges, coffee, soda, and lots of treats (for humans and dogs) and free catered lunches semi-monthly (currently on hold due to COVID-19)
Regular team activities, including happy hours, snow tubing, game nights, and more

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

The role

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE’s vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company. You will work closely across the Engineering, Product, Design as well as Sales, Compliance and Customer Support team(s) working with stakeholders as highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent partners. This role reports to Manager, Data Engineering.

This role is responsible for:

Building and maintaining ONE's data infrastructure.
Developing and owning ONE's streaming data transformation pipeline.
Managing and supporting reporting and analytics tools.
Collaborating closely with our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
Tracking and defining metrics around performance.
Additional duties as assigned by your manager.


You bring

Mid Career (5-10 Years)
Experience in Apache Spark, Scala, Python, SQL.
Experience designing and implementing low latency data pipelines using Spark structured streaming.
Experience optimizing SQL queries and lake / warehouse data structures.
Cost-conscience creative problem solving.
Proficient in AWS cloud services and technologies.
Experience building, shipping — and growing — non-trivial products & services.
Passion for your craft, people, and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.
A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly. We hire for slope, not just y-intercept.


Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $175,000 to $190,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

Competitive cash
Benefits effective on day one
Early access to a high potential, high growth fintech
Generous stock option packages in an early-stage startup
Remote friendly (anywhere in the US) and office friendly - you pick the schedule
Flexible time off programs - vacation, sick, paid parental leave, and paid caregiver leave
401(k) plan with match


Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us. Email talent@one.app with any questions.

We are Semrush, a global IT company developing our own product – a platform for digital marketers. New stars are born here, so don’t miss your chance.

And this is our Data Engineer role for those who want to turn ideas into reality using code, algorithms, and maybe a bit of magic.

Tasks in the role

Develop and maintain data pipelines that feed our data warehouse.
Maintain documentation about data pipelines, processes, and schemas.
Oversee data pipeline execution and be the first point of contact for incidents regarding our data warehouse.
Collaborate with EADA Design practice and business stakeholders on definitions and models of data (entities, attributes, etc.) and linking these to metrics (standard and KPI).
Advocate for data literacy and democratization of analytics to create a data-driven culture.
Scout continuous improvements via new technology and methodology enablers—particularly those which allow business users access to more advanced analytics (e.g., data science, in-database analytics, code generation).


Who we are looking for

Proven track record in Data engineering or Data warehouse.
One or more years of experience working in cloud environments. Google Cloud experience is preferred over other clouds but not indispensable.
Knowledge of ETL tools and data profiling tools.
Good knowledge of Python, SQL (Postgres and Big Query).
Our data stack is based on Airflow, Apache Beam (cloud dataflow), SQL (Postgres, Bigquery, and Oracle), DBT, and Python. We would like to hire someone with experience in those technologies. Currently, we don’t use or plan to use Spark or Scala; but knowledge and experience are easily transferable.
Exposure to Data Governance and Data Quality initiatives or processes.
Creative mind and ability to think outside the box both conceptually and pragmatically.
Skilled communicator with ability to explain complex topics in simple terms both verbally and in written form.


They say there are no perfect candidates, but that might well be you, if

You have data and consulting experience.
Related academic research background.
Enjoys working, communicating (in English), and influencing multicultural distributed teams with a solutions-oriented ""can-do"" attitude, ""self-starter"" approach, and a good sense of humor to navigate, at times, ambiguous settings.
You share our common values: Trust, as we prefer to speak up and be our true selves; Sense of Ownership, as it’s not worth wasting time on something you don’t believe in; and enthusiasm for Constant Change, as we are always looking to make things better.


A Bit About The Team

You can get to know the team better at one of the interviews, but some brief information about future colleagues will be useful now.

Enterprise Architecture and Data Analytics (EADA) is a department reporting directly to the CIO. We provide guidance regarding the interdependencies of business, applications, data, and infrastructure planes during transformations and incremental changes, and we bring an end-to-end perspective to the table. We also manage internal Data Warehouses and BI, including the governance, quality, ingestion, and integration of Data. We are organized in three practices: Design, Data Delivery & Warehouse, and Analytics, and as a team distributed across various countries, mostly in Europe.

We will try to create all the right conditions for you to work and rest comfortably

It’s up to you to decide what work format works best for you. You can #wfo, #wfh, or mix both.
Flexible working day start.
Health insurance coverage.
Working from a modern coworking space (or working from home).
Internet coverage (up to 30 eur/month).
Corporate events.
Unlimited PTO.
Hobby benefit.
Training, courses, conferences.
English and Spanish courses.
Gifts for employees.

At eDO you’ll not only learn and develop, but also help to shape the future of travel at one of the world’s biggest online travel companies using cutting edge technology.

So, what’s NEXT?

NEXT is a one-year graduate program developed by eDreams ODIGEO and designed for those who are about to or have recently graduated from a tech-related degree.

It’s focused on personal learning and development at the same time that wants you to have the real experience of what it is like to work at eDO. No serving coffees or doing copies, here you’ll have the chance to do real work that has an impact on the world. Ok, maybe a cup of coffee or two because they are free at the office and we can always have a quick break.

The main goal here is to learn. So don’t worry if you still don’t have a lot of experience or knowledge. We got your back. During NEXT you’ll be able to develop the technical and soft skills that will help you start your career in technology to later keep growing through our career path. NEXT up, these are some of the things to expect:

Work directly in one of our Agile multidisciplinary teams where you will influence products in one of our many areas, such as our booking experience, payments, searches and many more, working with cutting edge technologies, like Java 8 to Java 11, ES6 code, frameworks like Backbone, Javascript libraries like ReactJS, VueJS and Lodash, Big Data (Kafka, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j…), BigTable, Docker, Google Cloud, Style Sheet preprocessors like SASS, testing frameworks and libraries like Mocha, Chai, Underscore, Automatic Functional Testing (Selenium + Cucumber + NodeJS) or packages and task runners like WebPack, Babel, Grunt, NPM.
Moreover, you could participate in a native mobile pod with iOS (Swift, Objective-C, XCTests, Fastlane, Cocoapods, Jenkins+CicleCI, Viper and Clean Architecture) and Android technologies (Kotlin, Java, Espresso, Jenkins, Gherkin and Cucumber, JUnit, Clean Architecture, Multinode, and a distributed, scalable app).
A dedicated onboarding and career path, tailored to your needs and goals, with the possibility of choosing a Backend, Frontend or Mobile path.
Mentoring from experienced peers, with guided training and learning on the job with Senior Developers, Architects, QA Managers and many more.
A true open culture where feedback is king. We work in an open and collaborative environment where every door is open and any idea valued.


What can I do NEXT?

Apply!

If you’re a recent graduate from any tech-related field, such as Computer Science or similar, are fluent in English and you still don’t have a lot of work experience, then what are you waiting for?

Of course it helps if you have coded before, but more than experience, we’re looking for people with a fresh and proactive attitude with a sharp analytical mindset. You’re basically a go-getter that is always looking for ways to improve and iterate. But most importantly, you’re eager to learn!

What can I get NEXT?

At NEXT you’ll have the same benefits as an eDOer. It’s not like we love lists, but here are just some of the main ones:

Flexible work policy, to enable you to regularly work from home (or wherever you want) but also have available offices to meet your colleagues. Basically, we support your lifestyle and your work-life balance.

Armed with a strong desire to progress and learn;
A quick learner with excellent communication skills to efficiently leverage the knowledge of more experienced members of the team;
