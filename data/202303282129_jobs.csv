This company operates much like a startup, being able to quickly pivot on new ideas and implement them, and has been ranked as one of Canada’s fastest growing companies. They currently have multiple projects in the works to improve the company’s relationship with its customers including a customer experience back-end system revamp, python-based customer profile matching system, adoption of a campaign management system, and a new modern POS system.

This is a full-time position that includes a competitive base salary, performance-based bonuses, extended health and dental benefits, RRSP and paid vacation.

Citylitics delivers predictive intelligence on local utility & public infrastructure markets

What is Infrastructure? It is the roadways you rely on to safely get to Grandma's house, it's the potable water that comes out of your kitchen tap that you wash your family's food with and it's the energy that heats our homes and powers our digital lifestyles.

Every year, trillions of dollars are spent on all areas of infrastructure to maintain our quality life and move our economy forward. However, our infrastructure is no longer equipped to meet the needs of the future. We hear about infrastructure failures, whether bridge collapses, power blackouts, or water main breaks, every day in the news. Climate change and extreme weather events are disrupting the basic infrastructure we took for granted for years.

Citylitics is solving the hardest data problems in infrastructure while building the market & opportunity intelligence platform that enables a faster, more transparent, and more efficient infrastructure marketplace. We turn millions of unstructured documents into high value intelligence feeds and datasets that are available on an intuitive user experience. Our goal is to enable solution providers to connect with cities with relevant infrastructure needs in a faster and more digital way than historic market channels. As more companies adopt our platform, cities & utilities will be able to access solutions that deliver on the promise of moving towards a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable infrastructure future.

What are we looking for?

We are looking for a Data Engineer with an ownership mindset where they can take a challenging data problem all the way through to an elegant tech solution that is robust and scalable. Someone who prides themselves on not only writing efficient code, but also in creating intuitive dashboards and data flows with clear and easy to read documentation. You will ship major product initiatives that fundamentally change the way that people see infrastructure data. This type of ownership will provide incredible opportunities for personal and professional growth. You will have ample technical and team leadership opportunities, depending on your interests.

What will you accomplish?

Design and implement scalable data pipelines that power our products and all the market insights that our customers love
Spearhead the development of end-to-end data management and customer-facing dashboards. Observe and foster best practices in business process design, implementation, and review.
Integrate (ingest, model, load, transform) data from external, heterogeneous sources and combine them with internal data to produce insights
Automate internal data processes and tooling
Developing Python code to facilitate the integration of additional data sources
Collaborating in cross-functional software/architecture design sessions to find the best data sessions for the problems that we are facing
Develop and maintain our data warehouse ETLs and automated report scheduling system
Create reports and data pipelines for stakeholders across the organization from multiple sources
Manage and launch new data pipelines, dashboards and machine learning models to accelerate our data strategy and roadmap
Other duties as assigned
Technologies we use:

Backend: Python, Django, Cloud SQL and Airflow/Cloud Composer as the main language, web framework, database and orchestration tool respectively
Cloud Infrastructure: Google Cloud Platform and Docker
Other Tools: Javascript, React as the main language and framework for our frontend


Requirements

2+ years experience with Python and Airflow/Cloud Composer
2+ years experience with database design and development
1+ year experience with Google Cloud Platform, Docker
Experience with Django is an asset, with a particular focus on Django migration


Benefits

This is a rare opportunity to influence positive change within one of the biggest societal challenges of our generation (infrastructure - from water to transport to energy and more).
Be a part of a scale up company with no corporate bureaucracy here. You will accomplish more here in a few months than what you would in a few years at a large, entrenched technology company.
Comprehensive health and dental benefits with an emphasis on mental health
Annual Learning and Development Budget and Plans
Flexible hours and work-from-wherever you are with the option to work in our downtown office if interested!
Competitive salary and equity incentives to give you a stake in our future

🌍 International environment

💰Competitive salary and perks

The revolution starts with small things: driving EVs, taking profit from renewable energy sources to avoid fuel... At Wallbox we work to make the world greener!

Why join Wallbox?

We create smart charging systems that combine innovative technology with outstanding design and manage the communication between vehicle, grid, building, and charger. We work with electric cars, build smart chargers, use solar panels and inverters and integrate everything into solutions for users around the world. Founded in 2015 as a Barcelona based start up, we have since grown to over 1000 Wallboxers from over 45 nationalities with a presence in Europe, Asia and the Americas!

From a top Spanish start-up to the first Spanish company to be listed on the NYSE, we are growing rapidly and we want you on board!

Our Data Journey:

Wallbox is committed to become a data driven company, not only for improving our decision making processes but also for helping us drive better our product development and incorporate data into our existing products or even create new business models.

We started our data journey just one year ago and it has already been an amazing drive! We’ve built a passionate and vibrant team, organised in a hub & spoke model, with roles such as data analysts, data engineers and analytics engineers.

Also we’ve been building a modern data stack, with technologies like Snowflake, Airflow, Fivetran, DBT, Tableau and Databricks. Our long term vision is to walk towards a data mesh model, where we will split people into producers and consumers domains.

Today our data lake is ingesting more than 1M events per hour coming from more than 350 sensors in our chargers. And this is just the beginning, as our goal is to reach one million online chargers by 2025.

About IOMED

IOMED is a leading technology start-up company in the field of massive medical data extraction and processing. It is made up of a united, young, dynamic, and flexible team, which, after several years of working together, is characterized by its agility, enjoyment of work, and rapport. Accordingly, we are looking for candidates with the desire to innovate, launch a relevant project, and grow with it, always enjoying teamwork and challenges, which are many, every day.

As an employer, we offer equal opportunity. We want to grow our team with talented, dynamic people who want to make their mark in the field of AI and research, regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, physical disability, or age.

What We Do

Nowadays, about 50% of clinical trials are delayed due to slow data collection from patients, which is done manually. As a result, clinical research is highly inefficient in both time and cost, taking years and billions of dollars to develop a new drug.

This problem could be solved through Real-World Data, that is, those contained in electronic medical records (EHRs). But unfortunately, up to 85% of existing clinical data is unstructured.

IOMED has found a solution to this situation, making it possible to fully harness the value of Real-World clinical data. We developed a tool that extracts the necessary data from clinical texts, resulting in a structured, standardized, and interoperable database that contains complete clinical information from hospitals.

In this way, non-reusable information is transformed into data available for Clinical Research, which allows increasing the number of patients that meet the criteria, as well as reducing the total time and manual work dedicated to this task.
