Awesome. Something led you here, maybe a glimpse of potential and something amazing? Well that‚Äôs how we feel about Klue.




Who are we?




Klue is a VC backed, capital-efficient high growth SaaS. Tiger Global and Salesforce Ventures led our US$62m Series B in the fall of 2021. We‚Äôre creating the category of competitive enablement: helping companies understand their market and outmaneuver their competition. We benefit from having an experienced leadership team working alongside several hundred risk-taking builders who elevate every day.




We‚Äôre one of Canada‚Äôs Most Admired Corporate Cultures by Waterstone HC, a Deloitte Technology Fast 50 & Fast 500 winner, and recipient of both the Startup of the Year and Tech Culture of the Year awards at the Technology Impact Awards.




The Insights' team scope covers data validation for existing sources, outsourced content, and new potential data sources. This role is focused on quality checks at scale and you will be key in ensuring that our data providers and outsourced content creators are delivering high-quality content that is linked back to source data. As the data marketplace is always evolving, you will also be involved in POC's of new data sources that can support manual curation initiatives.




This is You:




Highly analytical and critical thinker
Ability to digest and communicate complex data
You like ambiguity and thrive in fast-paced environments
You are an Excel and/or Python master
Strong communicator and natural networker
You like to learn new things and are keen to become an expert


Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that‚Äôs different from what we‚Äôve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let‚Äôs see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.




We‚Äôve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We‚Äôre early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We‚Äôre proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.




All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We‚Äôre excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

Our commitment to employment equity helps achieve inclusion and fairness, brings rich diversity to UBC as a workplace, and creates the necessary conditions for a rewarding career.

Job Summary

The UBC Department of Family Practice (DFP) has established the primary care Innovation Support Unit (ISU) in 2018 to connect, engage, and partner with those who are actively involved in innovations in primary care. The ISU is focused on supporting innovations in community-situated, team-based care (TBC) in BC, which includes initiatives in primary care transformation such as the Patient's Medical Home (PMH) and Primary Care Networks (PCNs). These are provincial strategic elements in achieving a sustainable and high-quality community and primary care system in BC. We are working with collaborators at UBC, the Ministry of Health, BC primary care communities, and several other groups.

The ISU has a number of independent, strategic workstreams related to specific aspects of TBC transformation in Primary Care. Workstreams are a collection of applied, mixed-method action-oriented projects clustering around a particular pressing issue or need in primary care in BC. Our current workstreams are: evaluation, community focused primary care transformation, and primary care system level support. In each of these workstreams, the ISU takes an action-oriented research approach to supporting change and improvement. There is increasing interest and support from a growing community of providers, divisions of family practice, health authorities, Ministry of Health, academic collaborators, and others to work with the ISU.

The ISU has been established as a small but nimble and highly networked team, working with many stakeholders. We are currently, looking to hire 1-2 more Evaluation Analysts to support the workstreams.

The Evaluation Analysts will work with workstream leads and ISU faculty, to perform a range of activities including: review of literature to collate existing, relevant evaluation tools for primary care, collaborative development of multi-method evaluation guides for primary care clinics and networks, summarizing findings and reviewing with stakeholders, facilitation, and report drafting as required. We are specifically looking for experience in:

Action research
Multi-method evaluation (planning and execution)
Quantitative methods to measure changes in behaviour and outcomes in primary care practices
Data visualization
Developing online communities of practice
Coordination


Some of our work will require more familiarity with action research and literature reviews, as well as quantitative and qualitative analysis. Other parts of our work focus more on design thinking, engagement of stakeholders and facilitation.

As the ISU has a Teal organizational structure, the Evaluation Analysts will be responsible for engaging across workstreams as required and as fits the skills of each of the team members. In this way, the ISU works very collaboratively and seeks to match team members to projects / workstreams that build on their strengths and skills. The ISU has opportunities for people with a range of skills and experience to broaden the team‚Äôs views as we tackle the complex challenges in primary care. We are looking for diversity and a broad range of experiences to complement other members of the team.

In the ISU we value justice, equity, diversity and inclusion (JEDI) and are working to develop and apply this lens as we work to support primary care systems change. As a team we engage with learning related to the decolonization of research and healthcare systems; team members are expected to have a willingness to learn, unlearn and engage in this work.

Organizational Status

Our commitment to employment equity helps achieve inclusion and fairness, brings rich diversity to UBC as a workplace, and creates the necessary conditions for a rewarding career.

Job Summary

The UBC Department of Family Practice (DFP) has established the primary care Innovation Support Unit (ISU) in 2018 to connect, engage, and partner with those who are actively involved in innovations in primary care. The ISU is focused on supporting innovations in community-situated, team-based care (TBC) in BC, which includes initiatives in primary care transformation such as the Patient's Medical Home (PMH) and Primary Care Networks (PCNs). These are provincial strategic elements in achieving a sustainable and high-quality community and primary care system in BC. We are working with collaborators at UBC, the Ministry of Health, BC primary care communities, and several other groups.

The ISU has a number of independent, strategic workstreams related to specific aspects of TBC transformation in Primary Care. Workstreams are a collection of applied, mixed-method action-oriented projects clustering around a particular pressing issue or need in primary care in BC. Our current workstreams are: evaluation, community focused primary care transformation, and primary care system level support. In each of these workstreams, the ISU takes an action-oriented research approach to supporting change and improvement. There is increasing interest and support from a growing community of providers, divisions of family practice, health authorities, Ministry of Health, academic collaborators, and others to work with the ISU.

The ISU has been established as a small but nimble and highly networked team, working with many stakeholders. We are currently, looking to hire 1-2 more Evaluation Analysts to support the workstreams.

The Evaluation Analysts will work with workstream leads and ISU faculty, to perform a range of activities including: review of literature to collate existing, relevant evaluation tools for primary care, collaborative development of multi-method evaluation guides for primary care clinics and networks, summarizing findings and reviewing with stakeholders, facilitation, and report drafting as required. We are specifically looking for experience in:

Action research
Multi-method evaluation (planning and execution)
Quantitative methods to measure changes in behaviour and outcomes in primary care practices
Data visualization
Developing online communities of practice
Coordination


Some of our work will require more familiarity with action research and literature reviews, as well as quantitative and qualitative analysis. Other parts of our work focus more on design thinking, engagement of stakeholders and facilitation.

As the ISU has a Teal organizational structure, the Evaluation Analysts will be responsible for engaging across workstreams as required and as fits the skills of each of the team members. In this way, the ISU works very collaboratively and seeks to match team members to projects / workstreams that build on their strengths and skills. The ISU has opportunities for people with a range of skills and experience to broaden the team‚Äôs views as we tackle the complex challenges in primary care. We are looking for diversity and a broad range of experiences to complement other members of the team.

In the ISU we value justice, equity, diversity and inclusion (JEDI) and are working to develop and apply this lens as we work to support primary care systems change. As a team we engage with learning related to the decolonization of research and healthcare systems; team members are expected to have a willingness to learn, unlearn and engage in this work.

Organizational Status

The Department of Family Practice supports researchers and faculty throughout the province. The ISU is a core unit of the department whose goal is to bring an applied academic lens to the changes that are actively occurring in primary care across the province. The ISU collaborates with the Ministry of Health, Health Authorities, Divisions of Family Practice, communities, and other provincial organizations to develop and link evidence to change initiatives. The ISU seeks to inform new models of care, test assumptions and gather data to inform system changes.

Work Performed

Support ISU workstreams by completing specific work, such as:
Lead relevant ISU learning cycles (projects) and work with ISU team members on planning of workstreams.
Lead rapid reviews of published evidence, partner documents and compile reports.
Work with workstream coordinators to review evaluation tools, options, summarize recommendations for stakeholders.
Work with primary care collaborators and lead the piloting of evaluation tools to assess value of findings with collaborators and stakeholders.
Work with workstream coordinators to develop draft models for describing service needs and service capacity in primary care.
Prepare ethics review submissions.
Spread ISU developed tools and methods
Prepare draft materials for knowledge translation (KT) including template evaluation guides for primary care networks and other primary care clinics.
Engage in KT and training through in person and virtual platforms as a co-facilitator of primary care team/primary care network support staff mapping methods.
Collate feedback and engage in the revision of the tools and methods.
Develop resources and tools to support Knowledge Mobilization
Prepare drafts of academic articles.
Develop other knowledge dissemination products, including outlines / scripts for videos or webinars (this could include participating in the production as well).
Work with ISU team
Engage in ISU team activities (meetings, design fests, etc.).
Contribute to the internal work of the ISU as a team (take on internal team roles, provide feedback on new ideas, etc.).
Prepare, edit and proof grant applications, contracts and scientific communications.

Vancouver, BC

We deliver foundational systems that shape the future of how technology is used in a top performing quantitative equity fund that manages over $28 billion in financial assets. This is a fantastic opportunity in the exciting intersection of finance and technology where investment decisions are made using technology. Quantitative equity funds use programmed investment strategies and as a result, our technology team is crucial to its success.

The team is headquartered and deeply rooted in West Coast Vancouver. We place high value on maintaining an entrepreneurial spirit and creating a culture where each of us has opportunities to succeed.

What You Will Do

The technology infrastructure team plays an essential role through innovative technologies: on-premises distributed computing, high capacity storage, cloud computing, networking, non-traditional high performance databases, data visualization, open source packages and custom applications. You own the entire technology infrastructure life cycle:

Engineer and support software and systems infrastructure.

Introduce new foundational technologies that advance our software engineering capabilities to the next level.

Collaborate with our software development teams on support issues and improvements to our infrastructure tools, processes, and software.

Act as a conduit between IT, network security, application development teams and other stakeholders to align priorities and translate business requirements into technical designs.

Improve systems infrastructure reliability.

Gather and analyze metrics from operating systems and applications to assist in performance tuning, fault finding and business continuity planning.

Design, plan and implement solutions in an entrepreneurial spirit.

What You Bring

Programming Knowledge ‚Äì you have an undergraduate, graduate, or post-graduate degree in a computer-related field OR exceptional programming skills gained through your work experience. We use several programming languages (Kdb+/Q, Python, Java, C#, Angular/Typescript).

Passion for Technology ‚Äì we work on low-level foundational systems and software. Knowledge about host-based networking, operating systems (specifically Windows and Linux), scripting, systems engineering, distributed systems, databases and cloud computing is useful in this role. Upfront knowledge is not required; if you are passionate about technology, learning new concepts is natural and fun.

Collaborative Communication ‚Äì we work together with many different teams and stakeholders. You have a collaborative spirit that helps you to work well with others and communicate effectively.

Project Ownership Mindset ‚Äì we own different technology stacks and are often responsible for exploring new technology to modernize existing systems. Our team needs to take initiative and proactively drive the execution of systems projects that we own. You enjoy taking on responsibility and owning decisions made. Organizational skills are helpful to ensure projects are well managed.

Troubleshooting and Problem Resolution - you think laterally to dissect a problem into its component parts and diagnose root causes. You use different troubleshooting techniques to identify problems across different technologies.

Growth Mindset ‚Äì technology and investment requirements are constantly changing. You are a lifelong learner who continually invests in personal development.

ONE is on a mission to help people live healthier financial lives. We‚Äôre doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money ‚Äì all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can‚Äôt access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world‚Äôs largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There‚Äôs never been a better moment to build a business that helps people live healthier financial lives. Come build with us!

The role

As an Engineer, Data, your mandate is to build the data transformation pipelines & reporting infrastructure that serve our members and run our company. This role will impact ONE‚Äôs vision by writing, reviewing, and shipping code and collaborating with others across the company. You will work closely across the Engineering, Product, Design as well as Sales, Compliance and Customer Support team(s) working with stakeholders as highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent partners. This role reports to Manager, Data Engineering.

This role is responsible for:

Building and maintaining ONE's data infrastructure.
Developing and owning ONE's streaming data transformation pipeline.
Managing and supporting reporting and analytics tools.
Collaborating closely with our Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
Tracking and defining metrics around performance.
Additional duties as assigned by your manager.


You bring

Mid Career (5-10 Years)
Experience in Apache Spark, Scala, Python, SQL.
Experience designing and implementing low latency data pipelines using Spark structured streaming.
Experience optimizing SQL queries and lake / warehouse data structures.
Cost-conscience creative problem solving.
Proficient in AWS cloud services and technologies.
Experience building, shipping ‚Äî and growing ‚Äî non-trivial products & services.
Passion for your craft, people, and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.
A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly. We hire for slope, not just y-intercept.


Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $175,000 to $190,000.

We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we‚Äôve adopted a flat titling structure at ONE. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as ‚ÄúSenior‚Äù to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. ‚ÄúEngineer, Platform‚Äù, ‚ÄúSales, Business Development‚Äù or ‚ÄúManager, Talent‚Äù). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within ONE.

What it's like working @ ONE

Our teams collaborate remotely and in our work spaces in New York and Sacramento.

Generous stock option packages in an early-stage startup
Remote friendly (anywhere in the US) and office friendly - you pick the schedule
Flexible time off programs - vacation, sick, paid parental leave, and paid caregiver leave
401(k) plan with match


Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us.

The revolution starts with small things: driving EVs, taking profit from renewable energy sources to avoid fuel... At Wallbox we work to make the world greener!

Why join Wallbox?

We create smart charging systems that combine innovative technology with outstanding design and manage the communication between vehicle, grid, building, and charger. We work with electric cars, build smart chargers, use solar panels and inverters and integrate everything into solutions for users around the world. Founded in 2015 as a Barcelona based start up, we have since grown to over 1000 Wallboxers from over 45 nationalities with a presence in Europe, Asia and the Americas!

From a top Spanish start-up to the first Spanish company to be listed on the NYSE, we are growing rapidly and we want you on board!




Our Data Journey:

Wallbox is committed to become a data driven company, not only for improving our decision making processes but also for helping us drive better our product development and incorporate data into our existing products or even create new business models.

We started our data journey just one year ago and it has already been an amazing drive! We‚Äôve built a passionate and vibrant team, organised in a hub & spoke model, with roles such as data analysts, data engineers and analytics engineers.

Also we‚Äôve been building a modern data stack, with technologies like Snowflake, Airflow, Fivetran, DBT, Tableau and Databricks. Our long term vision is to walk towards a data mesh model, where we will split people into producers and consumers domains.

Today our data lake is ingesting more than 1M events per hour coming from more than 350 sensors in our chargers. And this is just the beginning, as our goal is to reach one million online chargers by 2025.
