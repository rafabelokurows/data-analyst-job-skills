We are looking for a native-level Spanish speaker with excellent knowledge of Spanish culture and language references. You must also be completely fluent in written and spoken English.

Ideally, you’re an entrepreneurial self-starter, who has a passion for identifying and delivering insights that drive business decisions. We are looking for you if you normally ask yourself “so what?” to everything. Experience in social media analysis and a basic knowledge of social media query development would be a plus, but not mandatory as we will provide ongoing training on new social media platforms, channels and social analytics techniques.

Beyond social media analysis, experience in other digital research methodologies is also a plus (i.e. online focus groups, online surveys, digital analytics, and content analysis).

Have you worked in an agency? That would also be another great point in your favour, although not mandatory.

You will work translating business questions into digital and social media solutions, developing methodologies that utilise the range of analytical techniques available across the market. Understanding client needs and finding solutions will be key to your work and you will love going deep to surface compelling qualitative and quantitative insights.

You will be part of a global team.

This role is based in Spain and you will be working mostly from home. However, we ask that you meet with your line manager (also based in Madrid) at least once a week in a co-working space to work together. For the first few weeks, so as to be fully embedded in the company and clients, we might ask you to meet with your line manager more regularly (2-3 times a week).

Requirements

You must speak and write both English and Spanish fluently. You should understand both the language and context of Spain with ease.

You must have a BA/BS or equivalent undergraduate degree or equivalent practical experience.

You will be required to be:

Digitally savvy - able to understand and engage on Digital and Social Media platforms and understand how communication varies by platform (Twitter vs Facebook etc.). You should be conversant with abbreviations, platform-specific words and acronyms, and local variations specific to your country or language.
Show analytical capabilities. Additional previous experience as a Social Media Analyst or Digital Analyst would be a plus.
Possess excellent written communication skills, both in Spanish and English.
Able to work well independently and as part of a team.
Show excellent attention to detail.


Experience: recent graduates, 1-2 years of experience.

We have a range of clients, from agencies to direct enterprises, across diverse sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, consumer electronics, fashion and beauty as well as entertainment. These clients are looking to us to share deep cultural insights to answer their business questions, for example: ""What do people think of our products or services or those of our competitors? Who are our customers and what does their buying journey look like? How can we find influencers to help market our products?""

Convosphere is an independent, growing business. Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Hammersmith London, we are a varied and fun bunch, all passionate about showcasing the insights that social media has to offer. This is a great opportunity to work in an interesting and varied role for our growing, global business - as our business grows so will your role enabling you to progress your career swiftly.

Who are we?




Klue is a VC backed, capital-efficient high growth SaaS. Tiger Global and Salesforce Ventures led our US$62m Series B in the fall of 2021.

We’re one of Canada’s Most Admired Corporate Cultures by Waterstone HC, a Deloitte Technology Fast 50 & Fast 500 winner, and recipient of both the Startup of the Year and Tech Culture of the Year awards at the Technology Impact Awards.




The Insights' team scope covers data validation for existing sources, outsourced content, and new potential data sources. This role is focused on quality checks at scale and you will be key in ensuring that our data providers and outsourced content creators are delivering high-quality content that is linked back to source data. As the data marketplace is always evolving, you will also be involved in POC's of new data sources that can support manual curation initiatives.




This is You:




Highly analytical and critical thinker
Ability to digest and communicate complex data
You like ambiguity and thrive in fast-paced environments
You are an Excel and/or Python master
Strong communicator and natural networker
You like to learn new things and are keen to become an expert

Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.




We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

PHSA is committed to employment equity, encouraging all qualified individuals to apply. We recognize that our ability to provide the best care for our diverse patient populations relies on a rich diversity of skills, knowledge, background and experience, and value a safe, inclusive and welcoming environment.




Reconciliation is an ongoing process and a shared responsibility for all of us. The BC Governments’ unanimous passage of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act was a significant step forward in this journey—one that all health authorities are expected to support as we work in cooperation with Indigenous Peoples to establish a clear and sustainable path to lasting reconciliation.

Guiding these efforts Crown agencies must remain focused on creating opportunities that implement the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Mandate.

Guiding these efforts Crown agencies must remain focused on creating opportunities that implement the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Mandate.

Job Summary

This individual is a member of the Vaccine Evaluation Center (VEC) whose primary role is to provide consultation to Investigators in the identification of data, and on data collection processes and study outcome on multiple studies as dictated by study protocols. The position coordinates the tasks performed by the data team and involves supervision of the data team. These studies have varying levels of complexities requiring an overall understanding of the data structures and programming.

Organizational Status

Exercises data management judgement (including non-routine) and is accountable for own directed actions. Makes judgements as to how the decision fits with acceptable Good Clinical Data Management Practices and what the impact of the decision will be. Reports to Senior Data Manager of the VEC.

Work Performed

Development of highly-specialized case report forms (CRFs) for each study. The project team consists of the investigator(s), field administrators, study coordinator, statistician and data coordinator who decide what information is required for a study and how it will be collected. Using this information, the data coordinator will formulate the CRF that will encompass all the needs of the study and maintain good clinical data management practise guidelines. The investigator(s) have final approval of the CRFs. Each study is faced with unique issues and the data coordinator must research and evaluate appropriate uses of data collection tools, usage of words in questions and style of questions. The data coordinator is continually evaluating the CRFs and accompanying user’s manual to ensure that the best possible tools are provided for the study.

The data coordinator is responsible for designing and implementing systems for organizing and managing the flow of data from the field through data management to analysis and to long term storage. This requires good organizational skills as there can be 15-20 different studies in progress and at different stages. In addition, data is received from many different sites across Canada in multi-centre clinical trials, which adds to the complexity of the job. This individual supervises the work of the data entry and data monitoring staff. This involves training and monitoring staff, reviewing workload assignments and adjusting schedules to reflect changes and priorities within the VEC.

The data coordinator manages the data throughout the course of each study ensuring that all work performed by study staff adheres to policies and standards. The data coordinator is responsible for maintenance of the database until study completion. Upon meeting all requirements for clean data, the database is given to the Statistician. Each study and sponsor have different needs making each study unique. The individual must be adaptable to the needs of each study to ensure good clinical data management practices are maintained.

Databases (both routine and complex) are custom designed and maintained by the data coordinator. This requires an in-depth working knowledge of software being used and keeping abreast of software changes as they occur. Maintaining and upgrading of the databases forms part of the duties.

Works in conjunction with the statistician to develop descriptive aggregate statistics for data cleanup and ensure that final statistical programme incorporates data management decisions during the study.

When necessary, provides basic statistical programming support as per pre-defined analysis plan.

The data coordinator is responsible for the long-term storage of VEC data that conforms to government set standards. The data coordinator needs to keep up with changes in the technology and acceptable practices.

Consequence of Error/Judgement

Errors in judgement can result in significant damage to the Vaccine Evaluation Center’s academic reputation as a centre of excellence, nationally and internationally. Poorly designed databases can result in higher study costs because of extra time spent dealing with data entry, data management and data analysis. Poorly designed databases can also result in making it difficult to perform effective data analysis affecting the overall science of the study. Ineffective training of data staff has budgetary and human resource implications. The systems to organize and manage the flow of data that are not appropriately designed can lead to financial problems as well as problems with conforming to good clinical data management guidelines.

Supervision Received

Receives general directions from project team leader(s) and the investigator(s) as part of the specified project team for study related issues. Study related work is reviewed by the Senior Data Manager.

Supervision Given

Supervises the data staff, a group that includes up to 8 research assistants and data monitoring staff. This includes assigning and monitoring the work, training staff and participating in job evaluation/performance measures. Works with the statistician to coordinate the flow and priority setting of the data and the analysis.
