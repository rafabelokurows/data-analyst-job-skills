📍Location: Barcelona, Spain

🌍 International environment

💰Competitive salary and perks




The revolution starts with small things: driving EVs, taking profit from renewable energy sources to avoid fuel... At Wallbox we work to make the world greener!

Why join Wallbox?

We create smart charging systems that combine innovative technology with outstanding design and manage the communication between vehicle, grid, building, and charger. We work with electric cars, build smart chargers, use solar panels and inverters and integrate everything into solutions for users around the world. Founded in 2015 as a Barcelona based start up, we have since grown to over 1000 Wallboxers from over 45 nationalities with a presence in Europe, Asia and the Americas!

From a top Spanish start-up to the first Spanish company to be listed on the NYSE, we are growing rapidly and we want you on board!




Our Data Journey:

Wallbox is committed to become a data driven company, not only for improving our decision making processes but also for helping us drive better our product development and incorporate data into our existing products or even create new business models.

We started our data journey just one year ago and it has already been an amazing drive! We’ve built a passionate and vibrant team, organised in a hub & spoke model, with roles such as data analysts, data engineers and analytics engineers.

Also we’ve been building a modern data stack, with technologies like Snowflake, Airflow, Fivetran, DBT, Tableau and Databricks. Our long term vision is to walk towards a data mesh model, where we will split people into producers and consumers domains.

Today our data lake is ingesting more than 1M events per hour coming from more than 350 sensors in our chargers. And this is just the beginning, as our goal is to reach one million online chargers by 2025.

The Insights' team scope covers data validation for existing sources, outsourced content, and new potential data sources. This role is focused on quality checks at scale and you will be key in ensuring that our data providers and outsourced content creators are delivering high-quality content that is linked back to source data. As the data marketplace is always evolving, you will also be involved in POC's of new data sources that can support manual curation initiatives.




This is You:




Highly analytical and critical thinker

You like ambiguity and thrive in fast-paced environments
You are an Excel and/or Python master
Strong communicator and natural networker

We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

The mission of the Allen Institute is to unlock the complexities of bioscience and advance our knowledge to improve human health. Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the Allen Institute focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.




The mission of the Allen Institute for Brain Science is to accelerate the understanding of how the human brain works in health and disease. Using a big science approach, we generate useful public resources, drive technological and analytical advances, and discover fundamental brain properties through integration of experiments, modeling and theory.




As part of the NIH BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network, the Allen Institute is helping to lead a major new international consortium effort to create a comprehensive cell atlas of the human and closely related non-human primate brain. This project aims to make the most detailed map of the human brain ever produced, linking cellular and molecular phenotypes to brain imaging and functional architecture. To tackle this ambitious goal, we are seeking talented and highly motivated individuals to help create these atlases and help to make them transformative for neuroscience and biomedical research through open data sharing. The atlas will be based on a range of cutting edge high-throughput single cell molecular, spatial and cell phenotyping assays to map the structural and functional organization of the primate brain. We strive to build a catalytic brain cell reference and resource that will dramatically accelerate our understanding of brain structure, function and disease, and to create tools to help the community take advantage of these resources.




We are seeking a motivated data analyst who will aid collaborative efforts to explore the cellular organization of human, non-human primate and mouse brains. They will work under the close mentorship of scientists to analyze large-scale molecular genetics datasets. The successful candidate will quantify molecular features defining neurons – including transcriptional and gene regulatory multi-omics datasets – and compare these features across brain regions and species. They will actively engage with a team of scientists who are leading biologically driven research addressing how changes in brain organization are associated with evolution. They will also work closely with internal and external scientific teams to share and interpret computational analysis of large-scale, cross-species molecular profiling of cells.




The Allen Institute believes that team science significantly benefits from the participation of diverse voices, experiences and backgrounds. High-quality science can only be produced when it includes different perspectives. We are committed to increasing diversity across every team and encourage people from all backgrounds to apply for this role.
