Job Summary

This individual is a member of the Vaccine Evaluation Center (VEC) whose primary role is to provide consultation to Investigators in the identification of data, and on data collection processes and study outcome on multiple studies as dictated by study protocols. The position coordinates the tasks performed by the data team and involves supervision of the data team. These studies have varying levels of complexities requiring an overall understanding of the data structures and programming.

Organizational Status

Exercises data management judgement (including non-routine) and is accountable for own directed actions. Makes judgements as to how the decision fits with acceptable Good Clinical Data Management Practices and what the impact of the decision will be. Reports to Senior Data Manager of the VEC.

Work Performed

Development of highly-specialized case report forms (CRFs) for each study. The project team consists of the investigator(s), field administrators, study coordinator, statistician and data coordinator who decide what information is required for a study and how it will be collected. Using this information, the data coordinator will formulate the CRF that will encompass all the needs of the study and maintain good clinical data management practise guidelines. The investigator(s) have final approval of the CRFs. Each study is faced with unique issues and the data coordinator must research and evaluate appropriate uses of data collection tools, usage of words in questions and style of questions. The data coordinator is continually evaluating the CRFs and accompanying user’s manual to ensure that the best possible tools are provided for the study.

The data coordinator is responsible for designing and implementing systems for organizing and managing the flow of data from the field through data management to analysis and to long term storage. This requires good organizational skills as there can be 15-20 different studies in progress and at different stages. In addition, data is received from many different sites across Canada in multi-centre clinical trials, which adds to the complexity of the job. This individual supervises the work of the data entry and data monitoring staff. This involves training and monitoring staff, reviewing workload assignments and adjusting schedules to reflect changes and priorities within the VEC.

The data coordinator manages the data throughout the course of each study ensuring that all work performed by study staff adheres to policies and standards. The data coordinator is responsible for maintenance of the database until study completion. Upon meeting all requirements for clean data, the database is given to the Statistician. Each study and sponsor have different needs making each study unique. The individual must be adaptable to the needs of each study to ensure good clinical data management practices are maintained.

Databases (both routine and complex) are custom designed and maintained by the data coordinator. This requires an in-depth working knowledge of software being used and keeping abreast of software changes as they occur. Maintaining and upgrading of the databases forms part of the duties.

Works in conjunction with the statistician to develop descriptive aggregate statistics for data cleanup and ensure that final statistical programme incorporates data management decisions during the study.

When necessary, provides basic statistical programming support as per pre-defined analysis plan.

The data coordinator is responsible for the long-term storage of VEC data that conforms to government set standards. The data coordinator needs to keep up with changes in the technology and acceptable practices.

Consequence of Error/Judgement

Errors in judgement can result in significant damage to the Vaccine Evaluation Center’s academic reputation as a centre of excellence, nationally and internationally. Poorly designed databases can result in higher study costs because of extra time spent dealing with data entry, data management and data analysis. Poorly designed databases can also result in making it difficult to perform effective data analysis affecting the overall science of the study. Ineffective training of data staff has budgetary and human resource implications. The systems to organize and manage the flow of data that are not appropriately designed can lead to financial problems as well as problems with conforming to good clinical data management guidelines.

Supervision Received

Receives general directions from project team leader(s) and the investigator(s) as part of the specified project team for study related issues. Study related work is reviewed by the Senior Data Manager.

Supervision Given

Supervises the data staff, a group that includes up to 8 research assistants and data monitoring staff. This includes assigning and monitoring the work, training staff and participating in job evaluation/performance measures. Works with the statistician to coordinate the flow and priority setting of the data and the analysis. Works with the field administrator(s) to ensure the efficient flow of data from the field to the data team and to coordinate workload of research assistant staff.

Minimum Qualifications

The Equity & Inclusion Office is committed to ensuring that UBC is a community in which human rights are respected and equity, diversity, and inclusion are integral to university life. Through its leadership, vision, and collaborative action, the Equity & Inclusion Office (EIO) will further UBC's commitment to excellence, equity, and mutual respect.

The successful candidate will have significant experience working with teams in complex and diverse environments, a deep understanding of Indigeneity and critical race theory, and is experienced in navigating difficult conversations relating to power, privilege, discrimination, conflict engagement, and equity and inclusion.

This role will support the work of the EIO, as the key individual responsible for analyzing, reporting, and supporting the collection of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) evidence and related data. The analyst will provide senior-level analytical support to executive officers, Deans, Directors, and the community. The analyst will provide equity, diversity, and inclusion analysis in support of planning, policy formulation, and decision-making activities. The analyst will plan, design, conduct, and implement major research projects and studies, interpret results, and make formal presentations. The core work of this position is the development of institutional data infrastructure (dashboards, data dictionaries, working groups, access protocols, etc.) needed to inform research, analysis, and evaluation across several strategic initiatives focused on EDI at UBC.

Organizational Status

The EDI Data Analyst position will work with two offices, the Equity & Inclusion Office (EIO) and the Planning and Institutional Research Office (PAIR). This position will report to the Manager, Data, Analysis, Reporting & Evaluation (DARE) at the EIO working in close coordination with the Associate Director(s), Student Experience, Evaluation and Research (SEER), and in PAIR. The day-to-day human resources will be supervised by the Manager, DARE, in the EIO. This position will work closely with data analysts in PAIR and Strategists in the EIO and will maintain connections with a broad spectrum of data stakeholders at UBC.

The incumbent is expected to interact with other office staff in the EIO and PAIR, with staff from other departments, senior academic officers including Vice-Presidents, Deans, Directors, Department Heads, Senate Committees, representatives of other universities, government bodies and representatives, and other higher education and university-related organizations.

Work Performed


Provide timely, accurate, and meaningful EDI information for use by senior administrative and academic officers and committees in the formulation of programs and the resolution of issues related to equity, diversity, and inclusion throughout the University.
Plan, design, develop, and implement analytic reports, and statistical information in areas such as employment equity, student experience and demographics, and equitable survey design.

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have an absolute love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem, and living inside a spreadsheet/data set to find the answer to any question.
Because you love data, you have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, Google Data Studio/Data Visualization and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis. Experience with Marketing APIs, Big Query or other Cloud Data Warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.), ETL Tools (Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics) and/or Python are all pluses.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and have spent a minimum of 1 year working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.




What You’ll Do:

Reporting: With your expertise in Advanced Excel, SQL, Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools, you’ll be maintaining customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence, generating pivot tables and other visualizations that summarize thousands of lines of data. You should have experience in translating performance media metrics into coherent, digestible reports for client ad campaigns and be comfortable communicating via Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.
Strategy: You’ll be responsible for learning our clients’ businesses and aligning their media strategy with business goals as well as understanding advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to help guide media buying strategy. With a background in paid media and/or digital advertising, you understand concepts like LTV, ROAS and Incremental Revenue and are able to be engaged in discussions with clients to gain trust and shareholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.




Gupta Media is an office-first (with flexibility) organization and we are excited to have our team working together again

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. As our inaugural web analyst, you will play a pivotal role in boosting Notion's growth. You will identify opportunities on our website to enhance user sign-up conversion and improve the effectiveness of our SEO efforts. Collaborating closely with our marketing, data science, and engineering teams, you will help establish and define Notion's website metrics and targets. Your role will also include analyzing the performance of optimization experiments, creating monitoring dashboards for key pages, and shaping the process for measuring and analyzing Notion's website traffic data.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in data mining and data presentation, as well as your deep knowledge of website performance and SEO, to identify opportunities for improving Notion's website conversion and organic traffic beyond the numbers.
You will collaborate closely with our Web Optimization, SEO and Growth Product teams. Your role will involve making key recommendations about our website development priorities, understanding user behavior and navigation patterns, and establishing visitor segmentations and metrics.
You will influence your team's roadmap by sharing your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our investment in website optimization and SEO. (Insights are useful, but impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent 5+ years as a marketing analyst focused on instrumenting, understanding and analyzing website performance using a variety of tools.
You are fluent in event and cookie tracking methodologies, and can work directly with engineers to validate and debug tracking issues.
You bring a teacher’s mindset to working with stakeholders: you seek to develop a deep understanding yourself, and then use data and storytelling to teach your stakeholders about the drivers of business performance, as well as identify unique, actionable insights through independent study.
You have worked closely with CRO and SEO teams to optimize website performance at scale. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are an expert in SQL and have experience with Excel.
You relish turning ambiguous questions and problems into clear deliverables and insights.
You have built clean data visualizations and dashboards before using modern business intelligence tools (Tableau, Looker etc).
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.
