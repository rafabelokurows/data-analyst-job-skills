That’s why we love them!

Orbisk employees do talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!



As our Data Analyst, you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard

Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

The role in 6 bullets


Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.


Your track record mentions


You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.


Why join Orbisk?

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:


€4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

Collect, manage, and maintain data sources, including internal databases and external datasets, to ensure data accuracy and currency.

Awesome Office: Based in a beautiful office in the center, working here means delicious lunches cooked by our very own chefs, plus access to our own CF library to keep the learning going.
And a great team: We work hard and have fun together. On Fridays, we kick off the weekend together at the local bar, but there's more; we regularly organize events and company trips, creating opportunities to bond and build meaningful connections.

Data inzichtelijk maken is helemaal jouw ding. Jij vindt logica in een wirwar van cijfers, je brengt structuur aan en brengt data tot leven in heldere rapportages. En dat allemaal bij een van de toonaangevende webwinkels van Nederland!




Wat ga je doen?

123inkt.nl groeit hard en hiermee groeit ook de vraag naar inzichtelijke data. Je duikt niet alleen in de data van 123inkt.nl, maar ook van onze andere shops wereldwijd. Je haalt de juiste dataset uit de SQL-database, verwerkt deze en vertaalt dit naar een duidelijke rapportage in onze BI-tool (Power BI). Met je scherpe analytische blik creëer je overzicht uit chaos en adviseer je verschillende teams binnen het bedrijf. Je speelt een cruciale rol in het automatiseren van processen, waardoor we slimmer en efficiënter kunnen werken. Jouw inzichten stellen 123inkt.nl nog beter in staat om risico’s in te schatten en beslissingen te nemen.




We zijn een zelfstandige afdeling, maar werken nauw samen met allerlei andere afdelingen en hebben onderling dan ook veel contact. Samen met de andere Data Analisten zoeken we naar oplossingen, helpen we elkaar bij query’s en dashboards en bedenken we gave dingen. Heb je zelf goede ideeën of initiatieven waardoor we nog slimmer naar de data kunnen kijken? Dan is er altijd ruimte om dat te onderzoeken. Dankzij de open, informele sfeer voel je je snel thuis bij ons.

Wat vragen wij?

Je hebt een afgeronde hbo- of wo-opleiding, het liefst in de richting van Business of IT.
Je hebt minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring.
Je hebt ervaring met SQL en BI-tools (zoals Power BI).
Je bent analytisch ijzersterk, herkent snel patronen en je bent commercieel ingesteld.
Je spreekt en schrijft uitstekend Nederlands en Engels.




Wat bieden wij?

Een uitdagende functie in een sterk groeiend bedrijf.
De kans om je verder te ontwikkelen.
Uitstekend salaris en een aantrekkelijke pensioenregeling (wij betalen 75% van de premie).
Mogelijkheid tot reiskostenvergoeding.
25 vakantiedagen o.b.v. fulltime dienstverband.
Flexibele werktijden.
Extra's zoals personeelskorting, massage en gezonde lunches.




Sluit je aan bij ons datateam en help ons de toekomst te vormen!

Wat een leuke functie he? We verwachten deze dan ook zelf te kunnen invullen. Acquisitie vinden we zonde van jouw én onze tijd.

Vind jij het leuk om data te analyseren en dit om te zetten naar bruikbare rapportages, informatie en adviezen? Als junior data-analist bij Lyceo werk je in een klein team, maar maak je grote impact!




In 't kort

Werken in een leuk team, waar je veel kunt leren van je collega's.
Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals direct een contract voor onbepaalde tijd.
Een functie met impact bij de grootste onderwijsondersteuner van Nederland.
Ongekend goede werksfeer met gezellige lunches, borrels en een informele sfeer.




Lyceo – Leren leer je zo!

Ieder kind is anders. En met miljoenen verschillende talenten én struikelblokken, gaat leren niet voor iedereen vanzelf. Daarom hebben sommige leerlingen wat extra aandacht nodig. Aandacht voor leren zelf. Want leren kun je leren. Dat vinden we niet alleen, dat hebben we ook wetenschappelijk bewezen.




Bij Lyceo leren we leerlingen leren. Daar hebben ze bij elke toets, elk school- of studiejaar en bij alles wat ze daarna ondernemen, profijt van. Mede dankzij jou gaan leerlingen straks met meer zelfvertrouwen naar school.




Wat ga je doen?

Een greep uit de werkzaamheden:

Het zelfstandig maken van en onderhouden van waardevolle rapportages en dashboards voor de organisatie. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan een dashboard voor vestigingsmanagers waar zij inzicht krijgen in hun wekelijkse omzet, hun operationele cijfers en hun doelstellingen. Deze maak je primair in Power BI.
Je ondersteunt collega’s met data gerelateerde vragen. Dit kan van alles zijn, denk bijvoorbeeld aan HR die een selectie opvraagt van alle studenten die het afgelopen jaar hebben gewerkt als huiswerkbegeleider.
Het maken van analyses en prognoses om kansen en valkuilen te identificeren. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan het maken van een wervingsprognose om aan de hand van de verwachte vraag te voorspellen waar mogelijke tekorten kunnen ontstaan.




Data-Analist Nick aan het woord:

“Het zijn van een data-analist bij Lyceo betekent dat je te maken krijgt met alle afdelingen, mensen en processen van een dynamisch bedrijf, wat de baan ook ontzettend dynamisch en gevarieerde maakt. Stel je voor: de ene dag creëer je een emaillijst om klanten te benaderen voor de marketing afdeling, terwijl je de volgende dag een gloednieuw dashboard publiceert voor 150 vestigingsmanagers, zodat zij de prestaties van hun locaties kunnen volgen. Misschien help je finance om een foutieve omzetboeking te corrigeren, of presenteer je een analyse die de verkoop van examentrainingen volgend jaar zal laten groeien. Tussendoor beantwoord je ad-hoc vragen van collega’s over waar ze bepaalde data kunnen vinden en geef je hen toegang tot deze informatie. Niet alleen de werkzaamheden maken dit zo’n leuke functie ook de sfeer en regelmatige borrels maken het een ontzettend leuke, uitdagende en gezellige werkplek!”




Lyceo - en je collega’s

Met 175 vestigingen door heel Nederland en een hoofdkantoor in Leiden is Lyceo de grootste onderwijsondersteuner in Nederland. Een innovatieve onderneming die altijd in beweging is. Zo ontwikkelen wij continu nieuwe eigen lesmethodes en apps. Je vindt ons door het hele land met examentraining, huiswerkbegeleiding, studie- en beroepskeuze tot leren programmeren. We willen elke dag weer leerlingen motiveren het beste uit zichzelf te halen. Dit doen we door het geven van inhoudelijke begeleiding en het verbeteren van studievaardigheden. Onze kernwaarden zijn vertrouwen, deskundigheid en een flinke dosis positiviteit. Met ons Lyceo Extra programma zetten wij ons in voor gelijke kansen in het onderwijs.




Het Datateam bestaat uit twee andere data-analisten, Nick een Mariska en met plezier voegen we daar binnenkort een 3e data analist aan toe! Kom jij ons team versterken?




Je neemt met je mee...

Een afgeronde hbo/wo opleiding, bij voorkeur in een statistische richting.
Je kent in ieder geval de basisprincipes van SQL, visualisaties en statistiek.
Ervaring met Power BI is een pré.
Je bent nauwkeurig, proactief en oplossingsgericht.




Dit krijg je van ons

Natuurlijk mag je iets terugverwachten voor jouw tijd en inzet. Wij bieden jou op basis van een 40-urige werkweek onder meer:

Een salaris tussen de € 2.850,- en € 3.000,- bruto per maand op basis van 40 uur en afhankelijk van kennis en ervaring.
Direct een contract voor onbepaalde tijd.
23 vakantiedagen en 8% vakantiegeld.
Een pensioenregeling en volledige reiskostenvergoeding als je met het OV reist.
Een leuke werkplek in Leiden, met parkeerplekken en op 5 minuten loopafstand van Leiden Centraal.
Mogelijkheid tot deelname aan onze Lyceo Academie. Dit is ons trainingsprogramma waarin je fysieke en online trainingen kunt volgen die je helpen groeien als professional.
Onze geweldige kok Esther die vier dagen per week een heerlijke lunch bereidt, en als werknemer kun je voor een klein bedrag aan schuiven.
En niet te vergeten, onze enthousiaste medewerkersvereniging zorgt ervoor dat er elke maand wel iets leuks te beleven valt tegen een kleine vergoeding, of het nu gaat om borrels of activiteiten.




Aan het werk!

Samen ontdekken of deze baan past bij jouw kennis, vaardigheden en ambities? Je mag ons altijd bellen, appen of mailen. Recruiters Ellen, Melissa en Tess bereik je per telefoon of app via 071 790 00 56. Mailen kan naar recruitment@lyceo.nl.




Al helemaal overtuigd? Dan stuur je meteen je cv en motivatiebrief toe via het sollicitatieformulier. Die bekijken we binnen 1-3 werkdagen, waarna we hopelijk een gesprek kunnen plannen. Klikt het tijdens het sollicitatiegesprek? Dan voeren we een tweede gesprek waarin we je nog beter leren kennen. Iedereen enthousiast? Dan worden we collega’s!




Werk je voor een werving- en selectiebureau en wil je ons helpen met het vervullen van deze vacature? Niet nodig! Het Lyceo-gevoel ervaar je alleen als je direct bij ons solliciteert.

Would you like to be a part of the discussion about the best way to run the dairy business of the future? Would you find it interesting to figure out which performance indicators are key to ensuring that dairy farmers too can run their businesses optimally? Does clearly identifying the mutual correlations within all our data on animal health, automated feeding, reproduction and rations sound like a stimulating challenge to you? Do you also have ample experience of data analysis (agricultural industry, robotics, machines or IoT devices) and are you looking for a meaningful job in which you can make an essential contribution to an innovative and sustainable mission?

If so, please read on!

Thanks to the more than 30,000 (real-time) users of our management system, we already have plenty of big data on hand. As a data specialist, you will know better than anyone how to identify the correlations that will form the starting point for new plans and ideas. Quite cool, isn't it? As well as deploying your in-depth expertise on data analysis, you will be helping your team to monitor the progress of their project and the quality of their solutions.

Good communication skills are essential, as is an ability to tell a story in an inspiring fashion.

Since you will be collaborating closely with the Data Engineering and Data Science departments, some knowledge of these areas is also desirable. If you would really like to make a difference and feel this challenge is right up your street, we would love to hear from you!

What is your experience?


Education to higher vocational or university level.
Capability to think conceptually and advise stakeholders accordingly.
Experience as a Data Analyst (knowledge of dairy farming data would be an asset).
Experience in visualisation (acquired by working with e.g. Tableau, QlickView or PowerBI).
Experience with processing data (SQL, Python).
Experience with PySpark would be a great asset!
Knowledge of statistics and research methods.
Familiarity with operating on large data sets (terabytes).
(Azure) Cloud experience would be an asset.
Knowledge of machine learning/modelling would be an asset.
Some understanding of modern software engineering practices would be an asset.
Scrum experience would be an asset.


What do we offer you?

To address the food demand and challenge for 2050, it is crucial to handle people, animals, and the environment responsibly. For us, this means being a reliable long-term partner for our customers and passing on the world to the next generation through sustainable product development. You can contribute to realizing this dream.

What can you expect in your role as a Data Analyst?


Working in an international work environment within one of the most innovative organizations in the Netherlands and also the largest robot producer in Europe.
Excellent employment conditions, including up to 8 weeks of vacation and a salary of up to €5600,- with room for growth within the scale.
Opportunities for growth where you are in charge of your own development.
Space and freedom to innovate, bring in new ideas, and undertake initiatives. We not only offer this, but we also genuinely expect it. It's up to you to come up with ideas and implement them.
A team with enthusiastic, helpful colleagues, collaborating with product development, procurement, and other stakeholders.
Our Lely Academy offers various training programs, such as personality training or more job-relevant training. If you want to develop yourself but it's not in the curriculum, you discuss it with your manager.
The #FitatLely program with our own Lely Gym. A volleyball court, basketball court, football table, and ping pong table where you can challenge your colleagues or take a break from work.
Lease-a-Bike scheme to lease a new bike affordably.
Additionally, enjoy the services and wide range of coffee and tea from our personal barista at the Lely Campus, who makes the tastiest cappuccinos from fresh milk, directly from our own farmer from the Lely Orbiter, for example.
A healthy work-life balance with a hybrid policy where you are 60% on Campus. This is flexible and can be arranged in consultation with your manager. Prefer more time on our modern Campus? You are always welcome (between 06:00 a.m. and 08:00 p.m.).
Moreover, we love to celebrate. Whether it's an anniversary or our Christmas party, at Lely, we know how to celebrate! For a feel of the atmosphere, check out this video:

Recruitment & selection agency, consultancy, and/or staffing agency?

We appreciate the interest, but we recruit all our candidates directly. We understand that as intermediaries, you want to present candidates for our great positions and contribute to our ambitions, but this is not how we have set up our recruitment process. This means that all unsolicited profiles offered on Lely vacancies will be treated as direct applications.

Deine Fachexpertise: Du bringst praktische studienbegleitende Erfahrung im Design und der Umsetzung von Performance Management-Lösungen mit mindestens einer Softwarelösung (SAP Analytics Cloud, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau Desktop, Qlik Sense, CCH Tagetik oder weitere) mit. Grundlagenkenntnisse im Bereich Data Warehousing und BI & Analytics sind von Vorteil. Beste Voraussetzungen, um direkt bei uns durchzustarten.
Deine Kompetenzen: Du denkst sowohl analytisch als auch kreativ und fokussierst dich darauf, Lösungen für alle Herausforderungen zu finden. Sichere Englisch- und Deutschkenntnisse sind für dich ebenso selbstverständlich, wie der Umgang mit gängigen Office-Programmen (Excel, Word, PowerPoint).
Dein akademischer Hintergrund: Durch dein abgeschlossenes Studium in Wirtschaftswissenschaften, -ingenieurwesen, -informatik oder vergleichbaren Fachrichtungen bringst du ein breites theoretisches Wissen mit.

The Opportunity:

Critical decisions are made every single day to support our National Security. What if you could use your analytical skills to help your client make informed decisions? With all the information available today, it takes a skilled analyst to know how to find and interpret the best data to give their clients the right answers. As an Imagery Analyst, you use your specialized technical, regional, and functional experience and your attention to detail to develop imagery-based intelligence that gives your clients the actionable intelligence and context they need. If you have strong analytical skills and a problem-solving mindset, we have an opportunity to use those skills to support our warfighters, protect our national security, and inform our clients and national leadership.

Using your understanding of various collection platform capabilities and applications, you will help your client develop effective information fusion strategies combining GEOINT with other sources, including SIGINT, ELINT, MASINT, and open-source, to develop comprehensive reporting that informs your client and provides them with actionable intelligence. You’ll validate the information and apply imagery analysis tradecraft as you work to further refine collection strategies and analytic approaches to existing and emerging problem sets for warfighters, senior policymakers, internal clients, and U.S. IC-wide stakeholders. As the authority in your tradecraft, your client will look to you for time-critical recommendations, often under pressure. This is a chance to grow your expertise, develop new skills in Automated Tipping and Queueing software modeling tools, and share your methodologies with other analysts. We focus on growing as a team to deliver the best support to our customers, so you’ll have resources for mentoring and learning new skills and tools.

Du liebst Daten und hast erkannt, dass sie das Gold der Zukunft sind? Du möchtest lernen, Zusammenhänge und Muster darin zu erkennen? Sehr gut, dann suchen wir Dich ab Oktober 2024 am Standort Stuttgart für unser berufsbegleitendes Masterprogramm!

Das Masterstudium zeichnet sich durch eine hohe Anwendungsorientierung aus und ermöglicht ein gewinnbringendes Studieren in Verbindung mit dem Beruf. Dabei wird dir im theoretischen Teil des Studiums modernes Wissen, Vorgehensweisen und Tools in den Bereichen Datenanalyse, maschinelles Lernen, künstliche Intelligenz und Big Data vermittelt. Du lernst, wie Du Daten effektiv erfasst, verarbeitest, analysierst und modellierst, um große Datenmengen gewinnbringend zu nutzen, komplexe Probleme zu lösen und eine datenbasierte Entscheidungsfindung zu unterstützen.

Studiendauer: voraussichtlich 5 Semester

Deine Aufgaben

Das Masterstudium Data Science & Business Analytics bei DYMATRIX beinhaltet 3 Schwerpunkte: Data Management, Marketing Automation & Costumer Analytics/ Data Science. Nach dem Studium bist Du also in der Lage, die Kundenansprache von Unternehmen in Form von Marketingkampagnen mit Hilfe von Daten zu optimieren.

Data Management

Du wirst bei uns im Bereich Solutions & Consulting eingesetzt – und lernst so die technische und fachliche Grundlage für unser Business kennen:


Du erlebst, wie theoretische Vorlesungsinhalte zu „Business Intelligence“ und „Data Warehousing“ in der Praxis angewendet werden und arbeitest Dich mit unserer Unterstützung in die Themen ein. So bleiben ETL-Prozesse, OLAP-Cubes und Reportings für Dich nicht nur graue Theorie, sondern werden Bestandteil spannender Projektarbeit.
Du hebst das Datengold, indem Du lernst, komplexe Datenarchitekturen zur Massendaten- (BIG DATA) oder Echtzeitdatenverarbeitung zu konzipieren und zu realisieren.
Du sorgst für die Umsetzung auf Basis neuester Technologien unserer führenden Technikpartner, lässt das Gold in Social-Media-Plattformen fließen und optimierst den Fluss durch z.B. InMemory-Datenbanken.
… und dabei bleibst Du nicht stehen, sondern erschließt neue Goldminen und arbeitest Dich mit unserer Unterstützung in neue Technologien ein.


Marketing Automation:


Du erhältst Einblick in herausfordernde Prozesse im Bereich Marketing Automation und Customer Monitoring und unterstützt uns bei der Umsetzung.
Du sorgst für die Umsetzung Deines erworbenen Wissens rund um Data Management/ Business Analytics und Data Science, um die Marketingkampagnen unserer Kundenunternehmen zu automatisieren und zu optimieren.


Im letzten Semester arbeitest Du in Analytics-Projekten mit und hilfst gemeinsam mit uns dabei, das Datengold unserer Kunden weiter zu veredeln.

Customer Analytics/ Data Science


Anhand von Algorithmen und Modellen sagst Du vorher, was ein Kunde / eine Kundin wollen wird – vielleicht ohne, dass er / sie es selbst schon weiß!
Du optimierst den Gutscheinversand, prognostizierst Kündigungswahrscheinlichkeiten oder hilfst, die Zweitkaufrate zu steigern.
Dazu arbeitest du mit Daten in verschiedenen Speichersystemen (z.B. Hadoop, relationale Datenbanken, NoSQL) und bereitest die Inhalte für die konkrete Analysefragestellung auf.
Außerdem nutzt du statistische Software (KNIME, Apache Spark, R, Python …) um Analysen durchzuführen und verschiedene Data Mining-Modelle zu entwickeln.


Die dazugehörigen Vorlesungen und theoretischen Lehrinhalte werden Dir an einer unserer Kooperationshochschulen (z.B. HdM), ggf. in Form eines mehrstufigen Kontaktstudiums vermittelt.

Das Bringst Du Idealerweise Mit


abgeschlossenes Bachelor- oder Diplomstudium (mindestens 210 ECTS) in Wirtschaftsinformatik, -mathematik, -wissenschaften, Ökonometrie, Statistik, Psychologie, Physik, Informatik oder vergleichbare Studiengänge
mindestens eine einjährige einschlägige Berufserfahrung nach dem ersten Hochschulstudium
ausgeprägte analytische und konzeptionelle Denkweise
Programmieraffinität
Interesse an CRM/Marketing
sehr gute Präsentations- und Kommunikationsfähigkeiten
gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse

The Opportunity:

Critical decisions are made every single day. What if you could use your analytical skills to help them make informed decisions? With all the information available today, it takes a skilled analyst to know how to find and interpret the best data to give their clients the right answers. As an intelligence analyst, you use your specialized functional experience and your attention to detail to develop intelligence products and analytic assessments to give your clients the actionable intelligence and context they need.

You’ll analyze and maintain relationships at higher, lateral, and interagency elements to support staffing development plans. As the authority on your topic, your client will look to you for time-critical recommendations, often under pressure. This is a chance to grow your expertise and broaden your skillset into areas like operational due diligence in support of the identity management program, the practical application of OPSEC measures when conducting online activities, and the application of mitigation measures for existing and emerging technologies. You’ll share your expertise with other technicians through leadership and mentoring. We focus on growing as a team to deliver the best support to our customers, so you’ll have the resources to learn new skills and tools. Join us as we provide the right information at the right time to support the critical needs of our warfighters.

We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 3.6 million accommodations globally. Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 6,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership, enhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.

Our Purpose – Bridging the World Through Travel

We believe travel allows people to enjoy, learn and experience more of the amazing world we live in. It brings individuals and cultures closer together, fostering empathy, understanding and happiness.

We are a skillful, driven and diverse team from across the globe, united by a passion to make an impact. Harnessing our innovative technologies and strong partnerships, we aim to make travel easy and rewarding for everyone.

THIS ROLE IS BASED IN BANGKOK, THAILAND (WITH RELOCATION PROVIDED)

Location: Bangkok, Thailand (*Not open for remote work.)

Get to Know our Team:

Agoda first started selling air tickets in late 2019; we are currently looking to grow the commercial team in North Asia to help grow our young Flights business into a market leader in APAC.

As part of the Flights Team, you will be responsible for identifying new partners and opportunities, cultivating a relationship with them, and working together with them to deliver the best outcome for our end customers. You would also be responsible with managing the day to day interaction with the partner and working closely with other teams within Agoda to ensure the partners needs are met.

We design tailored business and product solutions with our partners and help them generate measurable value. Members of our team are empowered and supported to grow their market(s) or accounts. We develop win-win relationships and leverage Agoda’s unique accommodations portfolio and tech solutions to bring our partners the advantages they seek. Utilizing our strong brand and resources, we build new channels to increase the visibility of Agoda, introduce more travelers to our great products and service and deliver significant revenues to the overall business.

The Opportunity:

As an Analyst/Senior Analyst, you will report directly to either the Senior Manager or Associate Director within the Supply Department and this will be an individual contributor role. You will be responsible and fully empowered to work with the partners on the ground. You will be supported by a team within the Supply department and work closely with other Flight Commercial Team members within Agoda.

You will have the opportunity to be part of an exciting and brand new team and new business vertical for Agoda and have the rare opportunity of joining a ‘start-up’ within an established company.

In this Role, you’ll get to:


Translate internal briefs into analytical projects (to include refining the initial brief and asking the ‘right questions’, working through potential hypotheses and storyboarding the output)
Use and analyze data from multiple large-scale data warehouses and present statistically strong analysis to a wide range of business stakeholders
Proactively identify opportunities for growth within supply and the wider business
Drive new analytical initiatives and projects aimed at improving organizational efficiency and shaping Agoda supply
Identify, support, and lead projects aimed at scaling up the way the Supply organization leverages on data, insights, and intelligence
Automate manual operational processes and present back on time savings gained through modernization of business operations


What you’ll Need to Succeed:


At least 3-5+ years of experience working as an Analyst with experience in analytics/data science/insights/strategy/BI
Advanced working knowledge and hands-on experience in SQL
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in data visualization tools such as Tableau (preferably)
Expert domain of data analysis and data visualization tools and software such as Excel, Python (or R)
Bachelor’s degree ideally in a business or quantitative subject (e.g. computer science, mathematics, engineering, science, economics or finance)
A good understanding of statistical modelling knowledge or any machine learning technique knowledge (such as hypothesis testing, regression, logistic regression, random forest, etc.)
Good stakeholder management experience. Comfortable presenting to senior leadership and C-suite
Experience in conducting A/B testing experimentation
Strong experience in finding data insights and provide business recommendation to the business
A hacker’s mindset – the ability to build simple but clever and elegant solutions to new problems within significant resource, operational and time constraints through deep understanding of the business, creative problem solving, and a wide range of expertise in data, analytics, automation, programming, and prototyping
Excellent communicator with superior written, verbal, presentation and interpersonal communication skills
Data driven in both decision making and performance measurement
Extreme comfort in ambiguous, fast-paced environment
Ability to multi-task, prioritize and coordinate resources


It’s Great if you Have:


MBA or Masters in a quantitative subject (e.g. computer science, mathematics, engineering, science, economics or finance)
Program management certifications (e.g. PMI, PRINCE2) to compliment your program management experience
Asian market experience
Travel industry / e-commerce / tech / consulting experience

DEINE ROLLE - DAS WARTET AUF DICH

Wir haben Bock auf Daten! Du auch? Dann gestalte gemeinsam mit uns die Line of Business Data & Analytics. Wir fokussieren uns auf die Daten unserer Kunden und konzipieren Lösungen durch technologieunabhängige Beratung. Das Competence Center Data Engineering ist verantwortlich für die Umsetzung komplexer Big Data und Cloud Analytics Projekte für unsere namhaften Kunden. Als Data Engineer bist du Teil eines innovativen und stetig wachsenden Software Engineering Teams. Du profitierst von erfahrenen Kolleginnen und Kollegen und absolvierst ein spezielles Ausbildungsprogramm, um dein Wissen auszubauen und zu vertiefen.

Projektbasierte Umsetzung von Business Anforderungen mit Analytics Services von AWS, Azure und GCP oder etablierten On Premises Big Data Technologien
Stetige Weiterbildung in Technologien aus dem Cloud- und Software Engineering-Umfeld, um unsere Kunden als professioneller Consultant zu beraten


DEINE SKILLS - DAS BRINGST DU MIT


„Bock auf Daten“: Mit viel Begeisterung eignest du dir gerne neues Wissen zu Applikationen, Technologien und Tools im Data Analytics Kontext an
Basierend auf einem abgeschlossenen Studium (oder Vergleichbarem) hast du bereits Erfahrungen mit dem Cloud Analytics Ökosystem (AWS, Azure, GCP) oder dem Big Data Ökosystem (Hadoop, Kafka, …) gesammelt.
Du verfügst über Know-How in der Softwareentwicklung mit Java, Scala oder Python und hast in diesem Zusammenhang auch erste Erfahrung mit Buildtools und CI/CD Pipelines, wie z. B. Maven, Sbt, Git oder Gradle sammeln können.
Du kannst Cloud Strategien wie IaaS, PaaS, und SaaS einordnen und verstehst die unterschiedlichen Konzepte sowie IaC Technologien (Terraform, Ansible, Puppet)
Interesse an abwechslungsreichem Projektgeschäft durch regionale und überregionale Projekte


Unser Versprechen: Du wirst dich bei uns wohlfühlen! Kollegial, familiär und auf Augenhöhe – wir leben Austausch, Teamgeist und einen respektvollen Umgang miteinander. Diversität und verschiedene Blickwinkel werden bei uns genauso geschätzt wie du als Mensch. Das und viel mehr steht für unser ganz besonderes Wir-Gefühl. Für das es sogar ein Wort gibt: adessi.

Unsere Kultur und das Zusammenarbeiten sind geprägt von gegenseitiger Wertschätzung, Anerkennung und Unterstützung. Das verbindet uns hierarchieübergreifend – auch im Home-Office. So belegen wir zum wiederholten Mal den 1. Platz beim Wettbewerb „Deutschlands Beste Arbeitgeber in der ITK“!. Unser umfangreiches Trainingsangebot und ein transparentes Laufbahnstufenmodell für alle sorgen dafür, dass deine Entwicklung bei uns nicht stillsteht. Denn gemeinsam zu wachsen und Chancengeber zu sein, das ist programmiert in unserer DNA.

The Opportunity:

Critical decisions are made every single day to support our National Security. What if you could use your analytical skills to help your client make informed decisions? With all the information available today, it takes a skilled analyst to know how to find and interpret the best data to give their clients the right answers. As an Imagery Analyst, you use your specialized technical, regional, and functional experience and your attention to detail to develop imagery-based intelligence that gives your clients the actionable intelligence and context they need. If you have strong analytical skills and a problem-solving mindset, we have an opportunity to use those skills to support our warfighters, protect our national security, and inform our clients and national leadership.

You’ll validate the information and apply imagery analysis tradecraft as you work to further refine collection strategies and analytic approaches to existing and emerging problem sets for warfighters, senior policymakers, internal clients, and U.S. IC-wide stakeholders. As the authority in your tradecraft, your client will look to you for time-critical recommendations, often under pressure. This is a chance to grow your expertise, develop new skills in Automated Tipping and Queueing software modeling tools, and share your methodologies with other analysts. We focus on growing as a team to deliver the best support to our customers, so you’ll have resources for mentoring and learning new skills and tools.

Get to Know our Team:

As part of the Supply Analytics, you will be responsible for identifying new partners and opportunities, cultivating a relationship with them, and working together with them to deliver the best outcome for our end customers. You would also be responsible with managing the day-to-day interaction with the partner and working closely with other teams within Agoda to ensure the partners needs are met.

We design tailored business and product solutions with our partners and help them generate measurable value. Members of our team are empowered and supported to grow their market(s) or accounts. We develop win-win relationships and leverage Agoda’s unique accommodations portfolio and tech solutions to bring our partners the advantages they seek.

The Opportunity:

As an Analyst/Senior Analyst, you will report directly to either the Senior Manager or Associate Director within the Supply Department and this will be an individual contributor role.

You will be supported by a team within the Supply department and work closely with other Team members within Agoda.

In this Role, you’ll get to:

Use and analyze data from multiple large-scale data warehouses and present statistically strong analysis to a wide range of business stakeholders
Proactively identify opportunities for growth within supply and the wider business
Drive new analytical initiatives and projects aimed at improving organizational efficiency and shaping Agoda supply
Identify, support, and lead projects aimed at scaling up the way the Supply organization leverages on data, insights, and intelligence
Automate manual operational processes and present back on time savings gained through modernization of business operations


What you’ll Need to Succeed:


At least 3-5+ years of experience working as an Analyst with experience in analytics/data science/insights/strategy/BI
Advanced working knowledge and hands-on experience in SQL
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in data visualization tools such as Tableau (preferably)
Expert domain of data analysis and data visualization tools and software such as Excel, Python (or R)
Bachelor’s degree ideally in a business or quantitative subject (e.g. computer science, mathematics, engineering, science, economics or finance)
A good understanding of statistical modelling knowledge or any machine learning technique knowledge (such as hypothesis testing, regression, logistic regression, random forest, etc.)
Good stakeholder management experience. Comfortable presenting to senior leadership and C-suite
Experience in conducting A/B testing experimentation
Strong experience in finding data insights and provide business recommendation to the business
A hacker’s mindset – the ability to build simple but clever and elegant solutions to new problems within significant resource, operational and time constraints through deep understanding of the business, creative problem solving, and a wide range of expertise in data, analytics, automation, programming, and prototyping
Excellent communicator with superior written, verbal, presentation and interpersonal communication skills
Data driven in both decision making and performance measurement
Extreme comfort in ambiguous, fast-paced environment
Ability to multi-task, prioritize and coordinate resources


It’s Great if you Have:


MBA or Masters in a quantitative subject (e.g. computer science, mathematics, engineering, science, economics or finance)
Program management certifications (e.g. PMI, PRINCE2) to compliment your program management experience
Asian market experience
Travel industry / e-commerce / tech / consulting experience

Diversity is at our core. We're part Swedish. Part Canadian. Part French. Part Indian. Part Italian. Part British. Part Portuguese. You get the idea.
Great players can stay great players. Progress your career whether you choose to manage people or not.

Nu finns en unik möjlighet att bli del av datateamet i Schibsted Brand Studio, där du kommer att spela en viktig roll, både i det dagliga arbetet och i utvecklingen av vår dataanalys framåt.

Here are descriptions of working for Accenture form some of our super stars:

Simon: “I joined Accenture as a Data Engineer in Data & AI. Prior to joining Accenture most of my experience was built within startups, so joining Accenture was a bit different to what I was used to. Since joining I have spent most of my time in a large transformation project where I have held several roles and responsibilities. This has varied from business and data analysis to data engineering and report development.

Working at Accenture is a lot of fun! The pace is fast, and you are surrounded by skilled and driven people, meaning if you have questions it's super easy to reach out to someone for help or expertise. Furthermore, as an employer Accenture prioritizes development and encourages further education. This produces an environment where you can have a significant impact on your own career journey, with lots of opportunities to try new things and grow.

Besides project work there is a vibrant Accenture community which you can get involved with in many forms. Our own Data & AI hosts events and teambuilding activities, and we often combine events with other teams. These, along with the many Accenture wide communities and events make it easy to network and meet more people to collaborate with and learn from.”

Yasmin:

“I started my Accenture adventure in Paris, in 2018, as a data science intern. I was hands-on with deep learning and computer vision projects, developing prototypes and proofs of concept that contributed to our clients' innovation. With the industry's shift towards data-driven approaches, I moved into data engineering, focusing on cloud modernization and migrations. This shift provided me the opportunity to master various cloud technologies and scripting languages. In 2023, I relocated to Accenture Sweden, a country that had always intrigued me due to my previous Erasmus experience in Lund. My responsibilities expanded beyond client work to include co-leading our Data & AI community in Copenhagen and Malmö, hosting workshops/conferences/hackathons and engaging with our global Innovation and Ventures department.

What I appreciate most about Accenture is the opportunity to engage with various teams globally, which sets the opportunity to expand my horizons beyond my primary domain. Whether you are interested in sustainability, UX/UI, Gen AI, social initiatives, customers life trends, etc. there is something for each one of us.

If you are someone that is driven by curiosity and innovation, it is for sure one of the best places to be. In essence, my life at Accenture is an exciting journey, allowing me to explore new frontiers, much like an explorer charting new territories (just like my dream of setting foot on Mars). It's a role that demands technical skill, sustains continuous learning, and values community engagement.”

Most companies ramble on about purpose and making the world a better place. And pretty often it feels a bit… well, forced. But we’d like to think that our story is special for real.




Our founders, Shadi Bitar and Ninos Malki, came to Sweden from Syria when they were kids. Books became their compass, guiding them through the maze of life, and helping them shape their destinies in a new world.




Their dream was bold: What if they could unlock the world of books for everyone, making knowledge and inspiration accessible to all? Fast forward a few years, and the tale of Nextory was born.




At Nextory, we've crafted a revolutionary monthly subscription that empowers our users to devour books like never before, be it through reading or listening. It's not just a product; it's a passport to endless adventure and enlightenment.




And now, we're on a quest to find a Data Engineer, someone as passionate as we are about making the world a happier place and enriching lives through the world of reading. Join our extraordinary team, and let's script a future where every day is a chapter of discovery, and every book is a key to a richer life.

As a Data Engineer at Nextory you will work with keeping and developing the data drivenness of Nextotry throughout the organization. With a curious, innovative and analytical mindset and tech-savvy approach you will fuel our data-driven teams.

You will be a part of an amazing team and be at the core of understanding a consumer subscription service - always with the continuous aspiration to increase reading! The position is based in Stockholm and you report to our COO.




WHO YOU ARE

We believe that you are currently working in a similar role at a fast-moving company. We believe that you would like to develop a thorough understanding of how consumers use our service and be part of delivering key insights. By using various development techniques, you will keep us in the forefront of creating the best customer experience as well as providing a great self-service data platform. We believe that you take pride in structuring, integrating and transforming data on a daily basis - you believe that data quality is key!

If you have ambitions (or experience!) of working with areas like ML and AI we would love to give you a platform to show your practice! You thrive working in a dynamic and unpretentious environment where you take great responsibility for our product and your team!

Are you curious about the highs and lows of the cultural landscape surrounding us? Can you analyze contemporary life like no one else you know? Do you think that customers deserve better experiences with the brands they buy from? Do you want to improve the everyday lives of people coping with today’s products and services? Do you want to help brands reach their full potential? Yes to all of the above? Keep reading because it’s people like you we’d love to have on board!




We’re looking for quantitative researchers who love working with quant but also have experience combining quant and qual in mixed-methodology projects and who are open to learning more about qualitative research methods as a complement. At Augur we don’t organize our team according to methodology expertise, instead we believe that research methods should complement one another and are best used in combination. We think that the best researchers are those who can work and think in a hybrid fashion.




As a researcher at Augur you will manage and execute research projects for our clients, both stand-alone projects and research as part of bigger strategic assignments. You are analytical and understand that data and insights aren’t the same thing. You can turn insights into business value, can communicate your thinking in intuitive and engaging ways and enjoy both collaborating with and challenging clients throughout the research processes.




We want you to have documented experience within quantitative research and that you have, at some point in your career, worked with primary research in an agency environment. You may be a seasoned veteran or a rising star as long as you have your curiosity for people, culture and society intact. 




For us to consider your application we want to see that you:

-          Have a university degree within a relevant field

-          Are a good communicator, both verbally and in written text, in both Swedish and English

-          Have solid analytical skills

-          Are a great team-player

-          Are self-motivated with a high work ethic

-          Have an open mind and a can-do mentality




We believe that the right personality and a personal match with our team are more important than having the perfect CV. If you think you would thrive in our environment and share our values, we would love to hear from you. You may apply on LinkedIn or get in touch directly with Jan Unkuri through jan@augur.se.




Augur is one of the leading agencies in the Nordics developing human-centric brand and customer experiences. We analyze people and culture to create the brilliant businesses of tomorrow. We offer expert skills and knowledge within three areas of business services: Customer Insights, Customer Strategy and Customer-centric Innovation. We’re currently a team of over 30 extraordinary “augurs” and work continuously with brands like IKEA, Arla, SVT, Carlsberg, Spotify, ICA and Telenor. Our offices are in Stockholm, but we consider the Nordics our backyard and the world our playground.

Utveckla vår framtida plattform inom Data and Analytic
Påverka arkitektur, teknikval och processer
Bygga kvalitativa högpresterande datapipelines


Är du nyfiken på hur den här texten ska sluta? Kul! Vi gillar dig redan. Att vara nyfiken är viktigt för oss.

På SBAB spelar nämligen rollen mindre roll. Att du är kunnig förväntar vi oss. Det viktiga är att du vill vara med och bidra till vår kultur, attityd och vårt sätt att vara. Och eftersom vi är lika många experter som medarbetare, behöver alla vara just nyfikna och intresserade av varandras olikheter. Vi lyssnar in och omvärderar kontinuerligt. Vi tror på mångfald, att olika perspektiv berikar och att du är en viktig framgångsfaktor. Fortfarande nyfiken? Välkommen!

Att jobba som Data engineer

SBAB söker en Data Engineer som tycker om att koda i Python och har ett stort intresse för dataflöden och automatisering. Du trivs med att utveckla högkvalitativ och högpresterande kod med återanvändbara komponenter. Du tycker om det agila arbetssättet och gillar att arbeta tillsammans genom MOB- eller parprogrammering.

Du kommer att jobba på Data Science-avdelningen på SBAB och höra hemma i ett av avdelningens flera agila och prestigelösa team. Vi har en hybridlösning för vårt analysdata där vi jobbar både med cloud- och on-prem-miljöer med en hög grad av automatisering och DevOps-funktionalitet. Vi har en teknisk roadmap och en vision som vi vill ha din hjälp att utveckla och nå.

Blir du glad av att jobba med följande kommer du att trivas:


Python och SQL
Data-lagring (t.ex.i en Delta-lake)
Pipelines från t.ex. Kafka, API, externa- och tabulära källor
Hackdays


Har du även erfarenhet eller intresse av data virtualisering eller har du redan varit i kontakt med mikrotjänster, så är det en bonus. Du är en orädd person som gillar att experimentera och ta initiativ utanför din hemmaarena. Du bör vara flexibel när det kommer till verktyg, och vara öppen för att använda de komponenter som passar det specifika uppdraget. Vi ser gärna att du kan kommunicera väl på svenska i tal och skrift.

Nu är det semestertider! Vänligen notera att återkoppling kan dröja längre än vanligt.

Har du check på allt?


Nyfiken
Lagspelare
Högt engagemang
Självdrivande
Målmedveten


Annars då?

Gillar du oss, och tror att du kan bidra, är vårt tips att inte vänta för länge med att skicka in CV eller LinkedIn-profil. Har du andra idéer på hur du kan visa vem du är? Spännande! Hur du än ansöker så ser vi fram emot att lära känna dig mer.

I rollen som Data Engineer med fokus på Java, Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery och dbt blir du en viktig del i att utveckla tekniken för att möjliggöra vår vision att skapa en bättre framtid för miljoner människor!




*Under sommaren kan återkoppling dröja längre än vanligt, urvalsarbetet kommer påbörjas senast V.33.*




Om teamet och rollen:

Hos oss har teamen stark autonomi i att välja teknik för plattformen och dess utveckling. Vi jobbar tillsammans för att ständigt förbättra arkitekturen, funktionaliteten och teamets effektivitet och välmående, allt för att på bästa möjliga sätt kunna skapa värde från stora mängder data.




En data engineer i vårt team förstår värdet i att ta in utvecklartänket i dataområdet. Det innebär versionshantering, testning och att se data som en produkt. Det gäller även att, med DevOps-tänk i ryggraden, kunna utveckla modern infrastruktur i molnet och hur den kan knytas till befintliga strukturer på ett säkert sätt.




I dataplattformsteamet är det väsentligt att ha djup förståelse för både den centrala tekniken och användarupplevelsen på plattformen. Vi arbetar ständigt för att förstå hur vi kan minska utvecklare och andra kollegors kognitiva last och effektivisera plattformen. Det ska vara enkelt att bygga kundvärde på Avanza!




Vi utvecklar kontinuerligt plattformen så att den blir mer strömlinjeformad, säker och automatiserad. Det är hög innovationstakt inom datavärlden och detta ger oss möjligheten att bygga bättre och häftigare lösningar kontinuerligt. Vi hoppas du vill följa med oss på denna roliga resa framåt!




Hos oss kommer du:

Sätta ramarna för dataprodukter i dbt, BigQuery, Docker, Python och andra verktyg
Javautveckling för integrering med Avanzas backend-appar via Kafka
Jobba med verktyg så som Terraform på GCP
Ta fram verktyg för effektiva förädlingsflöden och datapipelines
Arbeta med säkerhet och behörigheter för data
Utbilda kollegor i tekniker och arkitektur




Din profil:

En data engineer i vårt team förstår vikten av samarbete och värdet i att vara service minded då våra kunder är Avanzas egna utvecklingsteam, det betyder coachning och support runt dataförädling inom kundteamens egna domäner. Teamet driver även autonomt många av sina projekt och för att trivas i rollen behöver du våga att testa och trivas i att driva dina initiativ framåt.




Vi tror du:

Är erfaren och kunnig inom systemutveckling i Java
Erfarenhet av AWS, GCP eller liknande molnmiljö
Har kunskap inom modern infrastruktur och DevOps (CI/CD, Testautomatisering) och relaterated verktyg så som Terraform och Docker
Är väl förtrogen med en data engineers verktygslåda (t ex Python, SQL, dbt, Airflow, Prefect eller Great Expectations)
Har goda kunskaper i svenska, både i tal och skrift




Det är meriterande om du:

Deltagit i ML- eller ML-Ops-projekt
Har erfarenhet inom IT-säkerhet




Ansökan

Skicka gärna din ansökan snarast då urvalet sker löpande, dock senast den 11 Augusti. Vi tar inte emot ansökningar via mejl p.g.a. GDPR.

Most companies ramble on about purpose and making the world a better place. And pretty often it feels a bit… well, forced. But we’d like to think that our story is special for real.




Our founders, Shadi Bitar and Ninos Malki, came to Sweden from Syria when they were kids. Books became their compass, guiding them through the maze of life, and helping them shape their destinies in a new world.




Their dream was bold: What if they could unlock the world of books for everyone, making knowledge and inspiration accessible to all? Fast forward a few years, and the tale of Nextory was born.




At Nextory, we've crafted a revolutionary monthly subscription that empowers our users to devour books like never before, be it through reading or listening. It's not just a product; it's a passport to endless adventure and enlightenment.




And now, we're on a quest to find a Data Engineer, someone as passionate as we are about making the world a happier place and enriching lives through the world of reading. Join our extraordinary team, and let's script a future where every day is a chapter of discovery, and every book is a key to a richer life.




WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING

As a Data Engineer at Nextory you will work with keeping and developing the data drivenness of Nextotry throughout the organization. With a curious, innovative and analytical mindset and tech-savvy approach you will fuel our data-driven teams.




Together with the team you will be responsible for data services which means, data warehousing, ML/AI, data quality and enabling data insights. You will build and run data pipelines, data warehouses, data frameworks and leverage ML/AI. We believe that you enjoy working autonomously in close collaboration with the cross-functional teams and other stakeholders.




You will be a part of an amazing team and be at the core of understanding a consumer subscription service - always with the continuous aspiration to increase reading! The position is based in Stockholm and you report to our COO.




WHO YOU ARE

We believe that you are currently working in a similar role at a fast-moving company. We believe that you would like to develop a thorough understanding of how consumers use our service and be part of delivering key insights. By using various development techniques, you will keep us in the forefront of creating the best customer experience as well as providing a great self-service data platform. We believe that you take pride in structuring, integrating and transforming data on a daily basis - you believe that data quality is key!

If you have ambitions (or experience!) of working with areas like ML and AI we would love to give you a platform to show your practice! You thrive working in a dynamic and unpretentious environment where you take great responsibility for our product and your team!




SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS

• We believe you have, for the field, relevant educational background

• We believe you have around 4 years of experience from working within the field

• We believe that you are an expert in SQL and have worked with Java, Python and/or similar languages

• We believe that you have experience with cloud infrastructure (Azure, AWS, GCP) and cloud data warehousing, preferably BigQuery or equivalent

• We believe that you have experience working with pipelines and data integration solutions with an ELT approach

• We believe that you have experience in operating, maintaining and ensuring quality of production grade software




We are looking forward to your application which should include a CV or LinkedIn profile.

Utveckla vår framtida plattform inom Data and Analytic
Påverka arkitektur, teknikval och processer
Bygga kvalitativa högpresterande datapipelines


Är du nyfiken på hur den här texten ska sluta? Kul! Vi gillar dig redan. Att vara nyfiken är viktigt för oss.

På SBAB spelar nämligen rollen mindre roll. Att du är kunnig förväntar vi oss. Det viktiga är att du vill vara med och bidra till vår kultur, attityd och vårt sätt att vara. Och eftersom vi är lika många experter som medarbetare, behöver alla vara just nyfikna och intresserade av varandras olikheter. Vi lyssnar in och omvärderar kontinuerligt. Vi tror på mångfald, att olika perspektiv berikar och att du är en viktig framgångsfaktor. Fortfarande nyfiken? Välkommen!

Att jobba som Data engineer

SBAB söker en Data Engineer som tycker om att koda i Python och har ett stort intresse för dataflöden och automatisering. Du trivs med att utveckla högkvalitativ och högpresterande kod med återanvändbara komponenter. Du tycker om det agila arbetssättet och gillar att arbeta tillsammans genom MOB- eller parprogrammering.

Du kommer att jobba på Data Science-avdelningen på SBAB och höra hemma i ett av avdelningens flera agila och prestigelösa team. Vi har en hybridlösning för vårt analysdata där vi jobbar både med cloud- och on-prem-miljöer med en hög grad av automatisering och DevOps-funktionalitet. Vi har en teknisk roadmap och en vision som vi vill ha din hjälp att utveckla och nå.

Blir du glad av att jobba med följande kommer du att trivas:


Python och SQL
Data-lagring (t.ex.i en Delta-lake)
Pipelines från t.ex. Kafka, API, externa- och tabulära källor
Hackdays


Har du även erfarenhet eller intresse av data virtualisering eller har du redan varit i kontakt med mikrotjänster, så är det en bonus. Du är en orädd person som gillar att experimentera och ta initiativ utanför din hemmaarena. Du bör vara flexibel när det kommer till verktyg, och vara öppen för att använda de komponenter som passar det specifika uppdraget. Vi ser gärna att du kan kommunicera väl på svenska i tal och skrift.

Nu är det semestertider! Vänligen notera att återkoppling kan dröja längre än vanligt.

Har du check på allt?


Nyfiken
Lagspelare
Högt engagemang
Självdrivande
Målmedveten


Annars då?

Gillar du oss, och tror att du kan bidra, är vårt tips att inte vänta för länge med att skicka in CV eller LinkedIn-profil. Har du andra idéer på hur du kan visa vem du är? Spännande! Hur du än ansöker så ser vi fram emot att lära känna dig mer.

I rollen som Data Engineer med fokus på Java, Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery och dbt blir du en viktig del i att utveckla tekniken för att möjliggöra vår vision att skapa en bättre framtid för miljoner människor!




*Under sommaren kan återkoppling dröja längre än vanligt, urvalsarbetet kommer påbörjas senast V.33.*




Om teamet och rollen:

Hos oss har teamen stark autonomi i att välja teknik för plattformen och dess utveckling. Vi jobbar tillsammans för att ständigt förbättra arkitekturen, funktionaliteten och teamets effektivitet och välmående, allt för att på bästa möjliga sätt kunna skapa värde från stora mängder data.




En data engineer i vårt team förstår värdet i att ta in utvecklartänket i dataområdet. Det innebär versionshantering, testning och att se data som en produkt. Det gäller även att, med DevOps-tänk i ryggraden, kunna utveckla modern infrastruktur i molnet och hur den kan knytas till befintliga strukturer på ett säkert sätt.




I dataplattformsteamet är det väsentligt att ha djup förståelse för både den centrala tekniken och användarupplevelsen på plattformen. Vi arbetar ständigt för att förstå hur vi kan minska utvecklare och andra kollegors kognitiva last och effektivisera plattformen. Det ska vara enkelt att bygga kundvärde på Avanza!




Vi utvecklar kontinuerligt plattformen så att den blir mer strömlinjeformad, säker och automatiserad. Det är hög innovationstakt inom datavärlden och detta ger oss möjligheten att bygga bättre och häftigare lösningar kontinuerligt. Vi hoppas du vill följa med oss på denna roliga resa framåt!




Hos oss kommer du:

Sätta ramarna för dataprodukter i dbt, BigQuery, Docker, Python och andra verktyg
Javautveckling för integrering med Avanzas backend-appar via Kafka
Jobba med verktyg så som Terraform på GCP
Ta fram verktyg för effektiva förädlingsflöden och datapipelines
Arbeta med säkerhet och behörigheter för data
Utbilda kollegor i tekniker och arkitektur




Din profil:

En data engineer i vårt team förstår vikten av samarbete och värdet i att vara service minded då våra kunder är Avanzas egna utvecklingsteam, det betyder coachning och support runt dataförädling inom kundteamens egna domäner. Teamet driver även autonomt många av sina projekt och för att trivas i rollen behöver du våga att testa och trivas i att driva dina initiativ framåt.




Vi tror du:

Är erfaren och kunnig inom systemutveckling i Java
Erfarenhet av AWS, GCP eller liknande molnmiljö
Har kunskap inom modern infrastruktur och DevOps (CI/CD, Testautomatisering) och relaterated verktyg så som Terraform och Docker
Är väl förtrogen med en data engineers verktygslåda (t ex Python, SQL, dbt, Airflow, Prefect eller Great Expectations)
Har goda kunskaper i svenska, både i tal och skrift




Det är meriterande om du:

Deltagit i ML- eller ML-Ops-projekt
Har erfarenhet inom IT-säkerhet




Ansökan

Skicka gärna din ansökan snarast då urvalet sker löpande, dock senast den 11 Augusti. Vi tar inte emot ansökningar via mejl p.g.a. GDPR.




Välkommen med din ansökan!

We're the leading social media agency in the business of spinning heads and stopping thumbs. We unleash the value of social for brands by combining expertise in data-driven strategy, innovative social campaigns, industry-leading creative, authentic content, and performance marketing to deliver measurable results. Founded by Max Whicher and Alex Bodini in 2016, Spin now boasts a team of over 50 proud social natives who deliver 360 social campaigns for global brands, including Google, Bupa, Ann Summers, Universal Music, Fujifilm, and Napolina.

Our blend of passion and fun has garnered us multiple awards for creating a fantastic workplace.

(This is where we brag about being recognised as one of the 'Top 100 Best Places to Work')




You can see more of what we're about at spinbrands.com and take a peek at our smiling faces on our 'About Us' page.




The Role

Less about us, more about you.

Ready to join our dynamic and rapidly expanding Performance team?

Join us as a Data Analyst and be at the forefront of the data-driven revolution in marketing! Reporting directly to the Performance Director, you’ll be contributing to our rapid growth and success. You'll dive deep into data from platforms like Google, Meta, and TikTok to unearth insights that shape campaigns. If you're keen to kickstart your career in a vibrant, fast-paced environment, we want to hear from you!




Here’s what you’ll be doing...

Data Integrations through Funnel: Our analytics platform has hundreds of millions of data points that we use to guide our understanding of campaign performance. You'll work on integrating data from multiple sources through Funnel, ensuring that the data is accurate and accessible for analysis. - We need you to help us understand!
Report Creation and Maintenance: You'll create and maintain Looker Studio reports that provide valuable insights that are crucial for decision-making within the organisation on a daily basis. Your role will include making continual improvements to ensure the reports are as accurate and useful as possible. - Get as creative as you’d like!
Experimentation: (Not in a science lab we promise) Running structured experiments is a key part of how the Spin team works across paid and organic social. You’ll be responsible for identifying testing opportunities, working with account managers to implement them, managing rewards from advertising partners, and communicating test results.
Data analysis: Our team helps answer the most fundamental questions in marketing: is it working, and why. We use incrementality studies to understand the impact our marketing efforts are having on our clients’ businesses, and deep-dive into trends using spreadsheets and Python notebooks - You love the details, the nitty gritty, you probably wanted to be a detective when you were younger!
Tracking: Our analysis relies on good quality data. You'll be responsible for helping our clients track events across various platforms. This will often involve auditing tracking setup, building tracking maps and helping our clients troubleshoot.




Here’s what we need from you...

You'll be highly proficient in using spreadsheets, as they will be a fundamental tool in your day-to-day responsibilities - Spreadsheets are what dreams are made of!
The ability analyse data to answer questions and surface insights to a high standard, and present them visually and clearly
You'll be part of a team and may need to present your findings, so the ability to communicate clearly and effectively is crucial - We don’t bite!
Given that you'll be handling data and generating reports, a keen eye for detail is essential to ensure the accuracy and reliability of your work
Knowledge of how marketing data works is critical to the success of this role - It’s a complex game and we love it!
Experience with SQL, JavaScript, or Python would be highly desirable and give you a significant advantage in performing more complex data analyses.
Previous experience working with Google Tag Manager, Meta Pixel, and Google Analytics would make you stand out as a candidate. Familiarity with any paid media management tools would also be a plus.
Knowledge and experience running A/B test and reporting your findings to the team
A keen interest in the emerging trends and technologies of AI and using it to measure metrics for organic and paid social
An excellent understanding of how paid social and organic social analysis can be applied to campaigns - The best of both worlds!




The Perks

A chance to play a part and make a difference in a young, rapidly developing agency whilst building your career.
Celebrate the company’s wins with our bonus scheme - earn up to an impressive 20% additional salary. Cha-ching!
Embrace the freedom of our flexi-working policy. No need to ask permission; grab your laptop, kick back in your favourite spot, and let the productivity flow from the comforts of home.

Enjoy a well-deserved 25 days of holiday
Look after your mental health with access to Spill Chat, a support app that connects you with real-life therapists.

Bond with the team with team outings, monthly social events, and an epic annual trip. We know how to have fun; trust us.

Develop, maintain, and execute data transformations to support the organization's metrics and analytics needs.
Create and maintain dashboards to visualize data, providing insights that enable data-driven decision-making.
Effectively communicate findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, and propose solutions to optimize processes or strategies based on those findings.




Requirements:

4-5+ years of experience working as a Data Analyst / BI Engineer at top tech startups or large companies.
Bachelor’s or higher in Mathematics, Engineering, Natural Sciences or a similar numerate degree.

Analytical Skills: Excellent analytical abilities with the capacity to collect, organize, and dissect large amounts of data with attention to detail and accuracy.
Problem-Solving Skills: Exceptional problem-solving capabilities to tackle complex business problems, and the ability to propose data-driven solutions.
Communication Skills: Strong communication skills to present findings and translate complex data insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
