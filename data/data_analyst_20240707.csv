MORE THAN A JOB:

Blacklane is a scale-up started in 2011, founded by Jens Wohltorf and Frank Steuer who wanted to create the first global chauffeur service. We started by filling chauffeurs' 'empty leg' journeys and have grown with our partners to over €100 million in annual revenue (pre-pandemic). Backed by Daimler and other investors in Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the UAE, we're now a trusted brand within corporate travel.

We believe in ethical business practices and have a strong company culture. Responding to the pandemic, we've successfully managed the crises and retained our talented crew! We are now poised for massive growth in 2021.


Continuous Learning: We believe that open and actionable feedback is the essential component of continuous development. Set your personal development plan and take an active role in our internal learning communities to progress your career.
Flexible Working: Even the most ambitious Blacklaner needs some time to unwind. Find out what works for you and your team with flexible working hours and home office days (working from home is the new normal).
Become Part of the Crew: Get to know your fellow Blacklaners through our regular team socials. Our success comes from a collaboration of more than 350 people from 70 nations and we are looking for more exceptional people to join us!
Employee Stock Options Plan: We want all Blacklaners to benefit from the company's success, so every employee gets virtual stock options.
Fair Remuneration: We've banded salary levels and matched them to the local costs of living, meaning you're always paid fairly and you know that the rest of the crew is too.
Sustainability: We care for both people and the planet, having launched the mobility's industry first global carbon offset scheme in 2017. Blacklane has pledged to deliver 75% of its journeys in electric vehicles by 2025.
Equal Opportunity: We are committed to inclusion and diversity. A company is only as strong as its crew, so we developed a work environment that is inclusive, inspiring and open.

We're making Africa the first cashless continent.

In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.

We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.

Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in.....

How you'll help us achieve it

We’re looking for an expert in statistical analysis focused on Experimentation and Causal Inference to join the Growth team at Wave. In this role, you will design, run, and analyze experiments in collaboration with product and operations teams to improve the product and customer experience.

In this role you will

Be embedded closely with our operations and product teams.
Generate insights using customer, merchant and agent data, which will include running power analyses, statistical modeling, and data visualization.
Design, implement and analyze experiments to evaluate the causal impact of new product features, promos, and operational process changes.
Design causal inference analysis plans using longitudinal data.
Explore large data sets to identify growth drivers and generate testable hypotheses.
Build and apply machine learning models to improve product features and to analyze heterogeneous treatment effects (e.g. using random forests and related methods).
Take ownership of the analytics process - from project scoping and design through communicating findings to stakeholders.

Key Details

You can work remotely from anywhere (between UTC -5 and +2) with reliable internet access.
You’re willing to travel to one of our key markets once per year for ~6 days (Wave covers all costs). We also provide a yearly stipend of $800 to meet with coworkers.
Our salaries are competitive and are calculated using a transparent formula. For this role, depending on your level, we offer a salary of up to $134,400 USD (paid in your local currency equivalent), plus a generous equity package.
We run performance reviews twice a year and award bonuses or promotions to strong performers who have been with the company for more than six months.
Major benefits:
Subsidized health insurance for you and your dependents and retirement contributions (both vary from country to country).
6 months of fully paid parental leave and subsidized fertility assistance.
Flexible vacation, with most folks taking between 30-40 days per year.
$10,000 annual charitable donation matching.

Experimentation and Causal Inference:
Deep knowledge of statistics and econometrics.
Expertise in experimental design including sampling, randomisation, stratification, and clustered designs.

MORE THAN A JOB:

Blacklane is a scale-up started in 2011, founded by Jens Wohltorf and Frank Steuer who wanted to create the first global chauffeur service. We started by filling chauffeurs' 'empty leg' journeys and have grown with our partners to over €100 million in annual revenue (pre-pandemic). Backed by Daimler and other investors in Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the UAE, we're now a trusted brand within corporate travel.

We believe in ethical business practices and have a strong company culture. Responding to the pandemic, we've successfully managed the crises and retained our talented crew! We are now poised for massive growth in 2021.


Continuous Learning: We believe that open and actionable feedback is the essential component of continuous development. Set your personal development plan and take an active role in our internal learning communities to progress your career.
Flexible Working: Even the most ambitious Blacklaner needs some time to unwind. Find out what works for you and your team with flexible working hours and home office days (working from home is the new normal).
Become Part of the Crew: Get to know your fellow Blacklaners through our regular team socials. Our success comes from a collaboration of more than 350 people from 70 nations and we are looking for more exceptional people to join us!
Employee Stock Options Plan: We want all Blacklaners to benefit from the company's success, so every employee gets virtual stock options.
Fair Remuneration: We've banded salary levels and matched them to the local costs of living, meaning you're always paid fairly and you know that the rest of the crew is too.
Sustainability: We care for both people and the planet, having launched the mobility's industry first global carbon offset scheme in 2017. Blacklane has pledged to deliver 75% of its journeys in electric vehicles by 2025.
Equal Opportunity: We are committed to inclusion and diversity. A company is only as strong as its crew, so we developed a work environment that is inclusive, inspiring and open. All qualified applicants receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

We're committed to building an inclusive and authentic workplace for everyone.

You could be the ideal candidate for this role, or perhaps another opportunity within our expanding business.

Octopus Electroverse (eMobility) ⚡ – Data /

Full-time /

Hybrid



About Octopus Electroverse

We’re making electric vehicle ownership as smart and as simple as possible, by building the giant, virtual charging platform of the future.

In just over 3 years, Octopus Electroverse has grown to become one of the largest eMobility players in Europe, with over 750,000 connected electric vehicle chargers and a customer ecosystem spanning web, iOS, Android, CarPlay, Android Auto & Automotive OS, and more.

But it’s just the start: we’re busy expanding internationally, working with more automotive and tech partners, building exciting new features at scale, and creating the integrated charging experiences of the future - all in the name of making public EV charging super simple for customers.

Electroverse is a multifunctional team made up of product, development, commercial, operations, marketing, partnerships and more - all focused together on making Octopus the go-to name in EV charging. And we’re looking for smart individuals with an interest in the space who can help us make it happen.

We're looking for a Data Analyst to join the Data Team within Electroverse.

This role offers a chance to contribute to the data solutions that will drive the electrification of transport. The role involves working with diverse datasets, from charge point locations and usage to marketing campaigns, sales, and operations data.

The ideal person will be passionate about leveraging data to provide insights and improve efficiency across various teams. You’ll need to be great at listening, understanding challenges and formulating pragmatic solutions.

This is a fantastic opportunity to help build out a small but growing team within the business; create processes and automation pipelines and help shape the framework for how the business will handle data going forward.

What You'll Do...


Develop Data and Automation Tools: Create tools to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the Electroverse product and processes.
Maintain Data Tools: Build, maintain, and support data tools, including managing the dbt codebase, building BI dashboards, and developing data.
Data Product Development: Develop new data products to offer key insights to external customers.
Conduct Analyses and Reconciliations: Perform one-off analyses and reconciliations using SQL, Python, and Jupyter notebooks.
Support Non-Technical Teams: Assist internal teams in accessing and utilising data more effectively, building tools for a non-technical audience and potentially providing technical coaching and training.
Collaborate Across Teams: Work closely with colleagues from Partnerships, Marketing, Operations, Engineering, and Finance within Electroverse and the broader Octopus Energy Group.



What You'll Have...


Data Modelling Experience: Proficiency in using dbt (ideally) for data modelling
Dashboard and Data Product Development: Experience in creating data dashboards and developing data products.
Collaborative Projects: Experience working on collaborative projects with business teams and familiarity with agile or similar methodologies.
Autonomous Problem-Solving: Ability to work independently, scope problems, and deliver pragmatic solutions.
Data Lifecycle Expertise: Versatility in handling the entire data lifecycle, from ingestion to visualisation and presentation.
Tool Building: Passion for creating robust and usable tools to enhance team efficiency.
Data Analysis Skills: Proficiency in SQL, python, pandas/numpy, Databricks/Jupyter Notebooks, and experience with large datasets in production environments.
Curiosity and Drive: Self-motivated with a strong desire to learn and improve.
Time Management: Ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously in a fast-paced environment.
Passion for Net Zero: You don’t need to be deeply familiar with the EV market and products (we can teach that), but a passion for the transition to net zero is an excellent start



What We Work With...


dbt for data modelling
Databricks Delta Lake for data lake and warehouse storage and querying
Python as our main programming language
Jupyter and Jupyter Hub for notebook analytics and collaboration
Circle CI for continuous deployment
AWS cloud infrastructure
Kubernetes for data services and task orchestration
Google Analytics, Amplitude and Firebase for client applications event processing
Airflow for job scheduling and tracking
Parquet and Delta file formats on S3 for data lake storage
Streamlit for data applications



We would prefer someone who can work in our London office 1/2 times a week and you will also need to have full working rights for the UK as we are unable to sponsor.

If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!

Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.

We stand up for individuality. We actively foster an inclusive workplace where diversity and individual difference are valued and leveraged to achieve the agency’s vision. And most importantly we value every individual’s wellbeing.

As a diversity champion, equal opportunities and disability confident employer and an ardent advocate of flexible working we understand that everyone has unique requirements and needs.

We are a global creative agency, but the individual really is at the heart of everything we do. We use data to find out what makes them tick. We use technology to talk to them one-to-one – but to one million at a time. And we use creativity to encourage them to engage, click, buy and bond, again and again.

Each brand is unique and has its own individual challenges. We pride ourselves in rising to each and every one of them, for brands such as KFC, Mercedes Benz, IKEA, Paypal and Virgin Media 02.

Us

In order to foster collaboration and relationships, our hybrid model requires three office days per week. As equal opportunities proponents, we are open to discuss any hybrid working related needs during the initial screening.

Learning and Development is important. We all know that. Its why we have a dedicated Learning and Development team and offer regular career conversations and bespoke L&D programmes so that you can leave us with more than when you started.

We recognise that the work of diversity, equity and inclusion calls on all of us. That’s why we set up The Neighbourhood. A collective of people, at different stages of the DE&I journey, whether impacted or allies, dedicated to helping our colleagues take ownership and effect change across 4 key pillars; Anti-racism, Disability, Gender & LGBTQ+ and Parents & Carers.

The Health and Wellbeing of our people matters immensely. We offer Coaching opportunities for all through our partnerships with Sanctus (mental health partner who provides online coaching; you can talk about anything, personal or professional) and Sayge (1:1 professional development coaching program). We have 40 trained Mental Health First Aiders across the agency and have Babylon Health (Private GP service) for all.

You’re better at work when you feel better in yourself. So, in addition to your annual holiday, you can take a “Me” day and an “Us” day, every year. Your “Me” day is for you to invest in yourself – go after a life goal, meditate, learn to paint, bake cakes or just have a duvet day watching Netflix!

Your “Us” day is all about giving back and helping others – volunteer, pick litter at a local park, hang out with the elderly or raise money for a local charity.

We’re progressive and always open to new initiatives, for example we’ve recently partnered with Fertifa (Leading Fertility and Reproductive Health benefit providers). Because we know the journey to becoming a family isn’t always easy (that includes men too), and we support our people through that journey whether you are new parent, experiencing the menopause, or anything else in between.

Whatever stage of life you are at, we make sure you have the tools you need to have a healthy work life balance.

US MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

Your Role

In the Data Analytics team you will ensure both the voice of the customer and CFO are represented in the room with hard evidence. As well as supporting exceptional customer experiences using data, you will help ensure every action we take is directly improving performance against your clients objectives.

Your experience with web and social analytics tools (GA / Adobe / Brandwatch / Sprinklr) and data visualisation tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker / etc) will enable you to uncover key insights across channels and create self-service dashboards.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

Develop reporting, analysis, and data visualisation solutions as part of a companywide MI portfolio.
Where requirements need wider data engineering and architecture support, document requirements and design information to be communicated into the wider team.
Challenge where requests for reporting and analysis go against our company data strategy or deviate from our data standards and processes.
Use your skills and data knowledge to coach, train, and support colleagues in the adoption of data analysis self-service.
Set expectations for and monitor data quality within reports and analysis, feeding back to the wider data function when anomalies are found.
Work within our data governance processes to implement common data definitions and best practices.
Understand how business processes can affect data quality via key source systems and help raise awareness to colleagues with data ownership responsibilities.
Keep our colleagues aware of the latest developments and capabilities in the Data Solutions, Data Insights, and wider data community.


What we are looking for:


Power BI report development including DAX.
Transact SQL and Python/Scala Scripting
Stakeholder management skills including requirements capture.
General analytical and modelling techniques
General data visualization and dashboard design techniques


What you will get in return:

As well as your salary, this role offers a discretionary bonus plus a broad range of benefits, including Non-Contributory Pension, Private Medical & Travel Insurance.

We started Marshmallow when we found out how unfair insurance prices are for people who move to the UK. All because the industry hasn’t given this huge cohort of people a second’s thought, and isn’t set up to price them properly.

We saw an opportunity to do things differently, so we made it our mission to back the ones who step outside the norm. Since we started, we’ve helped 100,000s of people get a fairer deal on their car insurance. Using technology, we serve people that are often overlooked by financial services companies, solving important problems for people who need it most.

We know there are millions of marginalised customers out there. And we know that they face unique problems that most companies aren’t even aware of. We believe that our future is helping these people by learning about their experiences, and building our company around their needs. And there are strong signs that there’s a need for a company like us. Earlier this year we hit profitability, which is a huge milestone, but the most exciting thing is that we’re only just getting started.

How We Work

We’re really proud of the culture we’ve created. We push for progress every day, because we know that we’ll only hit big milestones by taking lots of smaller steps. We’re always open to helping our team mates, sharing our ideas, experience and knowledge to solve problems together. We take risks, think creatively and experiment relentlessly to meet our customer’s needs, and never pass blame when things go wrong. We encourage people at all levels to take ownership of their work, and to be bold in challenging how we do things. Everyone has a voice and the opportunity to make an impact.

And autonomy and ownership are only possible with clear direction. That’s why we collaborate to do in-depth planning twice a year, and make sure we leave with clear goals and objectives that flow from top to bottom. To make sure we’re as aligned as possible across functions, most of our work rolls up into four tribes; Acquisition, Retention, Claims and Pricing, Underwriting & Fraud. Each tribe has multiple teams embedded in it, working cross-functionally to do great work.

We’re so excited for all of the challenges up ahead, and we need more people to help us tackle them! If life at Marshmallow sounds like it could be for you, explore our culture handbook or read our blog to find out more.

Full-time /

Hybrid



About Octopus Electroverse

We’re making electric vehicle ownership as smart and as simple as possible, by building the giant, virtual charging platform of the future.

In just over 3 years, Octopus Electroverse has grown to become one of the largest eMobility players in Europe, with over 750,000 connected electric vehicle chargers and a customer ecosystem spanning web, iOS, Android, CarPlay, Android Auto & Automotive OS, and more.

But it’s just the start: we’re busy expanding internationally, working with more automotive and tech partners, building exciting new features at scale, and creating the integrated charging experiences of the future - all in the name of making public EV charging super simple for customers.

Electroverse is a multifunctional team made up of product, development, commercial, operations, marketing, partnerships and more - all focused together on making Octopus the go-to name in EV charging. And we’re looking for smart individuals with an interest in the space who can help us make it happen.

We're looking for a Data Analyst to join the Data Team within Electroverse.

This role offers a chance to contribute to the data solutions that will drive the electrification of transport. The role involves working with diverse datasets, from charge point locations and usage to marketing campaigns, sales, and operations data.

The ideal person will be passionate about leveraging data to provide insights and improve efficiency across various teams. You’ll need to be great at listening, understanding challenges and formulating pragmatic solutions.

This is a fantastic opportunity to help build out a small but growing team within the business; create processes and automation pipelines and help shape the framework for how the business will handle data going forward.

What You'll Do...


Develop Data and Automation Tools: Create tools to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the Electroverse product and processes.
Maintain Data Tools: Build, maintain, and support data tools, including managing the dbt codebase, building BI dashboards, and developing data.
Data Product Development: Develop new data products to offer key insights to external customers.
Conduct Analyses and Reconciliations: Perform one-off analyses and reconciliations using SQL, Python, and Jupyter notebooks.
Support Non-Technical Teams: Assist internal teams in accessing and utilising data more effectively, building tools for a non-technical audience and potentially providing technical coaching and training.
Collaborate Across Teams: Work closely with colleagues from Partnerships, Marketing, Operations, Engineering, and Finance within Electroverse and the broader Octopus Energy Group.



What You'll Have...


Data Modelling Experience: Proficiency in using dbt (ideally) for data modelling
Dashboard and Data Product Development: Experience in creating data dashboards and developing data products.
Collaborative Projects: Experience working on collaborative projects with business teams and familiarity with agile or similar methodologies.
Autonomous Problem-Solving: Ability to work independently, scope problems, and deliver pragmatic solutions.
Data Lifecycle Expertise: Versatility in handling the entire data lifecycle, from ingestion to visualisation and presentation.
Tool Building: Passion for creating robust and usable tools to enhance team efficiency.
Data Analysis Skills: Proficiency in SQL, python, pandas/numpy, Databricks/Jupyter Notebooks, and experience with large datasets in production environments.
Curiosity and Drive: Self-motivated with a strong desire to learn and improve.
Time Management: Ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously in a fast-paced environment.
Passion for Net Zero: You don’t need to be deeply familiar with the EV market and products (we can teach that), but a passion for the transition to net zero is an excellent start



What We Work With...


dbt for data modelling
Databricks Delta Lake for data lake and warehouse storage and querying
Python as our main programming language
Jupyter and Jupyter Hub for notebook analytics and collaboration
Circle CI for continuous deployment
AWS cloud infrastructure
Kubernetes for data services and task orchestration
Google Analytics, Amplitude and Firebase for client applications event processing
Airflow for job scheduling and tracking
Parquet and Delta file formats on S3 for data lake storage
Streamlit for data applications



We would prefer someone who can work in our London office 1/2 times a week and you will also need to have full working rights for the UK as we are unable to sponsor.

If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!

Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity and encourages creative solutions to problems. All new engineers deploy working code their first week, and we strive to broaden individual impact with support from managers, mentors, and teams.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$147,900 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We go beyond software. Carbon6 is building a community to support ecommerce sellers by removing the barriers to selling online and simplifying their path to success. Developed by the brightest minds in the marketplace ecosystem, our suite of software tools and resources help entrepreneurs succeed at every stage of their journey. We are a global company across North America, Europe and Asia, made up of passionate entrepreneurs, expert sellers, and innovative thought leaders.

Founded in 2021, we have raised close to $100 million and quickly grown into a market leader. We work with the largest and most successful sellers, brands, agencies, and aggregators around the world to drive growth, maximize profitability and manage with intelligence to scale their businesses. In addition to collaborating with global giants such as Amazon, Walmart, Alibaba, and others, we foster partnerships with key industry players like BigCommerce, Teikametrics, Jungle Scout, and more. Through our innovative solutions and strategic alliances, we empower businesses of all sizes to excel in today's competitive landscape, driving success and fostering long-term growth for both our clients and partners.

The Opportunity (Hybrid)

Do you look at spreadsheets and think… why is this clearer? More actionable? Enhanced with meaningful visualizations? Do you stare at rows of data and love looking for and finding patterns? Is there a joy you find when you take an unordered collection of raw information and turn it into something meaningful, and better yet, see others use what you’ve created to make great decisions? If these all ring true to you, then you just might be the Data Analyst that we’re looking for.

Carbon6 is searching for a Data Analyst for our best-of-breed, multi-million dollar Amazon reimbursements and recovery tool. In this role, you’ll have a massive influence on the decisions that our internal team and our customers make–many who are themselves million-dollar Amazon sellers. This role is hands-on, and far more than just creating charts and graphs through a BI tool. You’ll be deeply involved in our data collection, migration, aggregation, analysis, and automation.

Your Responsibilities


Metrics Development: Define and establish key metrics that matter to our organization, and drive toward calculating those metrics across massive and often disparate datasets, both internal and external.
Data Integration: Identify and integrate new data sources into our data ecosystem to enhance our analytical capabilities from key Amazon, Walmart, and key third parties across the ecommerce ecosystem
Cross-functional Collaboration: Work closely with sales, operations, and of course product and engineering to understand their data needs and prioritize them in line with business goals
Data Processing: Leverage SQL to transform raw data into actionable insights, continuously optimizing our data platform for improved performance and scalability
Automation and Quality Assurance: Build trust in our data through robust automation and data quality processes that ensure that we never expose invalid or inaccurate data to your internal and external consumers
Data Visualization: Use your skills in BI tools (PowerBI, Tableau, Sisense, or similar) to create compelling reports and dashboards that support data-driven decisions, going beyond basic informatics to reveal key insights and drive decision making
Ad-hoc Solutions: Develop quick, temporary data solutions for immediate needs while contributing to long-term data infrastructure
Documentation: Ensure that all data processes and solutions are well-documented and sustainable for future use





Your Qualifications


Practical Experience: Solid track record as an Intermediate/Senior Data Analyst for a minimum of 4 years, actively involved in crafting and sustaining data analytics in complex settings
SQL Expertise: Proficient in SQL, including data modeling and crafting advanced queries
Business Intelligence Tools: Experienced in using BI tools like PowerBI, Tableau, or Sisense to visualize data and build dashboards
Detail-oriented: Strong attention to detail, with a passion for solving complex data challenges and ensuring data accuracy
Best Practices: Comprehensive grasp of data analysis principles, methodologies, and tools, encompassing data retrieval, staging, and visualization
Analytical Skills: Exceptional analytical prowess, coupled with the capability to dissect intricate data compilations and extract significant interpretations
Teamwork and Communication: Adept at seamlessly collaborating with diverse teams and stakeholders
Agile: Proven experience working on an Agile team with 1- or 2-week sprints, Scrum, and daily standups.
BONUS: Amazon Vendor/Seller Central experience either directly or through APIs





Perks & Benefits
🚀 As an early member of our team, you'll receive competitive compensation and a generous stock option plan.

🦷 Extended health benefits including Medical, Dental, and Vision starting on Day 1.

We believe that unchecked biases disproportionately impact the most marginalized people in society—including but not limited to BIPOC, LGBTQ2S+ people, immigrants, and people with disabilities. We strongly encourage applications from people with these identities or other marginalized communities because we believe that without you, we are all less. If you are selected for an interview and require support during the process, including disability accommodation, we'll give you the opportunity to tell us when we contact you.

Job Summary

This individual is a member of the Vaccine Evaluation Center (VEC) whose primary role is to provide consultation to Investigators in the identification of data, and on data collection processes and study outcome on multiple studies as dictated by study protocols. The position coordinates the tasks performed by the data team and involves supervision of the data team. These studies have varying levels of complexities requiring an overall understanding of the data structures and programming.

Organizational Status

Exercises data management judgement (including non-routine) and is accountable for own directed actions. Makes judgements as to how the decision fits with acceptable Good Clinical Data Management Practices and what the impact of the decision will be. Reports to Senior Data Manager of the VEC.

Work Performed

Development of highly-specialized case report forms (CRFs) for each study. The project team consists of the investigator(s), field administrators, study coordinator, statistician and data coordinator who decide what information is required for a study and how it will be collected. Using this information, the data coordinator will formulate the CRF that will encompass all the needs of the study and maintain good clinical data management practise guidelines. The investigator(s) have final approval of the CRFs. Each study is faced with unique issues and the data coordinator must research and evaluate appropriate uses of data collection tools, usage of words in questions and style of questions. The data coordinator is continually evaluating the CRFs and accompanying user’s manual to ensure that the best possible tools are provided for the study.

The data coordinator is responsible for designing and implementing systems for organizing and managing the flow of data from the field through data management to analysis and to long term storage. This requires good organizational skills as there can be 15-20 different studies in progress and at different stages. In addition, data is received from many different sites across Canada in multi-centre clinical trials, which adds to the complexity of the job. This individual supervises the work of the data entry and data monitoring staff. This involves training and monitoring staff, reviewing workload assignments and adjusting schedules to reflect changes and priorities within the VEC.

The data coordinator manages the data throughout the course of each study ensuring that all work performed by study staff adheres to policies and standards. The data coordinator is responsible for maintenance of the database until study completion. Upon meeting all requirements for clean data, the database is given to the Statistician. Each study and sponsor have different needs making each study unique. The individual must be adaptable to the needs of each study to ensure good clinical data management practices are maintained.

Databases (both routine and complex) are custom designed and maintained by the data coordinator. This requires an in-depth working knowledge of software being used and keeping abreast of software changes as they occur. Maintaining and upgrading of the databases forms part of the duties.

Works in conjunction with the statistician to develop descriptive aggregate statistics for data cleanup and ensure that final statistical programme incorporates data management decisions during the study.

When necessary, provides basic statistical programming support as per pre-defined analysis plan.

The data coordinator is responsible for the long-term storage of VEC data that conforms to government set standards. The data coordinator needs to keep up with changes in the technology and acceptable practices.

Consequence of Error/Judgement

Errors in judgement can result in significant damage to the Vaccine Evaluation Center’s academic reputation as a centre of excellence, nationally and internationally. Poorly designed databases can result in higher study costs because of extra time spent dealing with data entry, data management and data analysis. Poorly designed databases can also result in making it difficult to perform effective data analysis affecting the overall science of the study. Ineffective training of data staff has budgetary and human resource implications. The systems to organize and manage the flow of data that are not appropriately designed can lead to financial problems as well as problems with conforming to good clinical data management guidelines.

In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge and made a commitment to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. We invited others to join us and there are now more than 300 businesses and organizations across 51 industries and 29 countries that have signed the Pledge, which means we are collectively coming at the climate crisis from nearly every sector and nearly every angle.

As part of our efforts to decarbonize our business, we became the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in 2020. We are on a path to power our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025.

We recently announced that AWS will be water positive by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations. The company also announced its 2021 global water use efficiency (WUE) metric of 0.25 liters of water per kilowatt-hour, demonstrating AWS’s leadership in water efficiency among cloud providers. To learn more about AWS’s water+ commitment visit: Water Stewardship.

Come join the team that is building the tools and innovative technology to track and share sustainability metrics for our customers.

As a Data Engineering Leader with Amazon, you will mentor and lead engineers. You will guide your team towards the best data development practices. You will serve as a leader in the team to define the priorities and vision of the group. You will collaborate with users around the globe.

About Us

Inclusive Team Culture

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally.

Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life.

We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship & Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.
