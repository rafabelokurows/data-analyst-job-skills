You will also collaborate with a variety of internal partner teams across Azure and Microsoft. You will build reliable, secured, highly scalable, performant data pipelines to enhance the Azure Compute allocation, deliver capacity management and efficiency improvements. The value of your work will be reflected in improvements to the Azure platform, Azure service capacity fulfillment rate, customer satisfaction, and various efficiency metrics, including COGS reduction.

The Azure Compute Capacity and Efficiency (AC2E) team is the team in Azure Core tasked with managing all aspects of Compute capacity and efficiency management across the fleet. Capacity Management needs to ensure that on the one hand, there is sufficient capacity across all regions, allocation domains, and hardware infrastructure to meet all customer demand, while on the other hand ensuring that capacity is provisioned efficiently thereby avoiding overspending and COGS/CAPEX impact. At the scale of Azure’s business, managing this trade-off across the entire Azure Compute fleet is an enormously complex and challenging task, where improvements can make the difference between customer allocation failures on the one hand, and gargantuan savings on the other.

As a Data Engineer II in the team, you will work closely with our software engineers, program managers, and data scientists across different teams within Azure Core. You will also collaborate with a variety of internal partner teams across Azure and Microsoft. You will build reliable, secured, highly scalable, performant data pipelines to enhance the Azure Compute allocation, deliver capacity management and efficiency improvements. The value of your work will be reflected in improvements to the Azure platform, Azure service capacity fulfillment rate, customer satisfaction, and various efficiency metrics, including COGS reduction. You will have opportunities for mentorship, accelerate your career growth, and work on truly high-business impact areas.

This platform is one of the lowest levels of the services software/hardware stack and includes an efficient, virtualized computational substrate, a fully automated service management system, and a comprehensive set of highly scalable storage services.

The Azure Compute Capacity and Efficiency (AC2E) team is the team in Azure Core tasked with managing all aspects of Compute capacity and efficiency management across the fleet. Capacity Management needs to ensure that on the one hand, there is sufficient capacity across all regions, allocation domains, and hardware infrastructure to meet all customer demand, while on the other hand ensuring that capacity is provisioned efficiently thereby avoiding overspending and COGS/CAPEX impact. At the scale of Azure’s business, managing this trade-off across the entire Azure Compute fleet is an enormously complex task, where improvements can make the difference between customer allocation failures on the one hand, and gargantuan savings on the other.

As a Data Engineer in the team, you will work closely with our software engineers, program managers, and data scientists across different teams within Azure Core. You will also collaborate with a variety of internal partner teams across Azure and Microsoft. You will build reliable, secured, highly scalable, performant data pipelines to enhance the Azure Compute allocation, deliver capacity management and efficiency improvements. The value of your work will be reflected in improvements to the Azure platform, Azure service capacity fulfillment rate, customer satisfaction, and various efficiency metrics, including COGS reduction. You will have opportunities for mentorship, accelerate your career growth, and work on truly high-business impact areas.

Microsoft’s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As employees we come together with a growth mindset, innovate to empower others, and collaborate to realize our shared goals. Each day we build on our values of respect, integrity, and accountability to create a culture of inclusion where everyone can thrive at work and beyond.

In alignment with our Microsoft values, we are committed to cultivating an inclusive work environment for all employees to positively impact our culture every day.

          The Azure Core Organization is responsible for creating the foundation of Microsoft’s Cloud Platform for utility computing. This platform is one of the lowest levels of the services software/hardware stack and includes an efficient, virtualized computational substrate, a fully automated service management system, and a comprehensive set of highly scalable storage services.<br><br>The Azure Compute Capacity and Efficiency (AC2E) team is the team in Azure Core tasked with managing all aspects of Compute capacity and efficiency management across the fleet. Capacity Management needs to ensure that on the one hand, there is sufficient capacity across all regions, allocation domains, and hardware infrastructure to meet all customer demand, while on the other hand ensuring that capacity is provisioned efficiently thereby avoiding overspending and COGS/CAPEX impact. At the scale of Azure’s business, managing this trade-off across the entire Azure Compute fleet is an enormously complex task, where improvements can make the difference between customer allocation failures on the one hand, and gargantuan savings on the other.<br><br>As a Data Engineer in the team, you will work closely with our software engineers, program managers, and data scientists across different teams within Azure Core. You will also collaborate with a variety of internal partner teams across Azure and Microsoft. You will build reliable, secured, highly scalable, performant data pipelines to enhance the Azure Compute allocation, deliver capacity management and efficiency improvements. The value of your work will be reflected in improvements to the Azure platform, Azure service capacity fulfillment rate, customer satisfaction, and various efficiency metrics, including COGS reduction. You will have opportunities for mentorship, accelerate your career growth, and work on truly high-business impact areas.<br><br>Microsoft’s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As employees we come together with a growth mindset, innovate to empower others, and collaborate to realize our shared goals. Each day we build on our values of respect, integrity, and accountability to create a culture of inclusion where everyone can thrive at work and beyond.<br><br>In alignment with our Microsoft values, we are committed to cultivating an inclusive work environment for all employees to positively impact our culture every day.<br><br><strong>Responsibilities<br><br></strong><ul><li>Data Engineering, insights generation and analytics with deep domain knowledge understanding.</li><li>With detailed instructions, you’ll implement code to extract raw data, validate its quality, and ensure the correct data is ingested within your area of work after cooking, data transformation.</li><li>You will follow data modeling and handling procedures to maintain compliance with all applicable laws and policies across your assigned workstreams.</li><li>Integrating analytics intelligence into the Azure platform</li><li>Advocate for best practices in data engineering.</li><li>Other</li><ul><li>Embody our Culture and Values<br></li></ul></ul><strong>Qualifications<br><br></strong><strong>Required Qualifications: <br><br></strong><ul><li>Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, or related field OR equivalent experience.<br><br></li></ul><strong>Other Requirements<br><br></strong><ul><li>Ability to meet Microsoft, customer and/or government security screening requirements are required for this role.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. As our inaugural web analyst, you will play a pivotal role in boosting Notion's growth. You will identify opportunities on our website to enhance user sign-up conversion and improve the effectiveness of our SEO efforts. Collaborating closely with our marketing, data science, and engineering teams, you will help establish and define Notion's website metrics and targets. Your role will also include analyzing the performance of optimization experiments, creating monitoring dashboards for key pages, and shaping the process for measuring and analyzing Notion's website traffic data.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in data mining and data presentation, as well as your deep knowledge of website performance and SEO, to identify opportunities for improving Notion's website conversion and organic traffic beyond the numbers.
You will collaborate closely with our Web Optimization, SEO and Growth Product teams. Your role will involve making key recommendations about our website development priorities, understanding user behavior and navigation patterns, and establishing visitor segmentations and metrics.
You will influence your team's roadmap by sharing your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our investment in website optimization and SEO. (Insights are useful, but impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent 5+ years as a marketing analyst focused on instrumenting, understanding and analyzing website performance using a variety of tools.
You are fluent in event and cookie tracking methodologies, and can work directly with engineers to validate and debug tracking issues.
You bring a teacher’s mindset to working with stakeholders: you seek to develop a deep understanding yourself, and then use data and storytelling to teach your stakeholders about the drivers of business performance, as well as identify unique, actionable insights through independent study.
You have worked closely with CRO and SEO teams to optimize website performance at scale. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are an expert in SQL and have experience with Excel.
You relish turning ambiguous questions and problems into clear deliverables and insights.
You have built clean data visualizations and dashboards before using modern business intelligence tools (Tableau, Looker etc).
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
Mobile app tracking & analytics experience is a big plus.
You are a power user of either Google Analytics or Amplitude.
You are familiar with a scripting language for analytics, ideally Python or R.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have solid experience working with marketing teams to drive decision-making.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work.

You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.

Collaborate with stakeholders to manage a long-term analytic roadmap that balances the tactical and strategic needs of the business

Job Summary

We are seeking a research data analyst that is interested in applying quantitative analytical methods to improve public health. Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide, and innovative tools and approaches are needed to improve the diagnosis and care of individuals with TB infection and disease. This includes children, for whom there is a critical need to improve TB disease and infection detection. The Data Analyst will work with research scientists, clinicians, public health practitioners and collaborators both domestically and internationally to support the collection and analysis of a wide range of data types, including clinical, biological, digital, and real world data, in order to advance TB care locally and globally.

Current Major Projects Include


Electronic health record (EHR)-based tools to support the latent TB infection (LTBI) care cascade for children in California. We have developed an EHR-based workflow to improve the screening, diagnosis and treatment of LTBI. The Data Analyst will evaluate any changes in outcomes after implementation of these tools by analyzing EHR data across multiple clinics, and will utilize these findings to guide the development of new interventions to improve and/or expand these tools. Skills of interest includes analysis of large datasets, and experience with analysis of EHR or real world data, or a strong interest to work with these data types.
The epidemiology and care cascade for Hepatitis B-TB co-infection. In partnership with collaborators from local public health departments and other regional health systems, we are examining the LTBI care cascade for individuals who are living with Hepatitis B and TB infection. Utilizing EHR, surveillance, and claims data, the Data Analyst will conduct the evaluation of the Hepatitis B-TB care cascade to guide interventions to improve the care of this vulnerable population. Skills of interest are similar to the child LTBI care cascade analyses.
Rapid Research in Diagnostics Development for TB Network (R2D2 TB Network) – This National Institutes of Health (NIH) U01-funded project established a multi-country platform for identifying promising early stage diagnostics from a broad range of product developers and conducting field evaluations in TB endemic countries to advance their development and evaluate their accuracy. This includes the evaluation of novel diagnostics in children (R2D2 Kids) and the role of digital diagnostics (i.e., cough sounds, lung sounds, chest x-ray images). The Data Analyst will work with other data analysts, data scientists and clinical research coordinators to support data collection, data management and accuracy analyses. Skills of interest include experience with REDCap, data management, and statistical computing (i.e., R, Stata, or Python).
Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings – This NIH R01-funded study seeks to identify novel biomarkers that can diagnose TB in children, utilizing retrospective and prospective cohorts in Uganda, South Africa, the Gambia, Peru and India. We will develop and validate combined host- and pathogen-based biosignatures using large ‘Omics-based datasets including proteomics and metabolomics, combined with clinical data. As needed, the Data Analyst will work with other data analysts, data scientists, and lab-based researchers to maintain the biorepository database and support analyses.
Progression of Tuberculosis infection in young children with and without HIV (PROTECT). This is an NIH-funded study that seeks to identify biomarkers that will predict if a child with evidence of TB exposure or infection will progression to symptomatic TB disease. Cross-sectional and serial biological samples from children from Uganda, South Africa, the Gambia, and Vietnam will be analyzed using high-throughput ‘Omics approaches including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. As needed, the Data Analyst will work with other data analysts, data scientists, and lab-based researchers to maintain the biorepository database and support analyses.

Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article. Please exercise caution and cease communications if something feels suspicious about your interactions.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The mission of the People Analytics team is to improve Stripe’s performance by collecting data, measuring critical constructs, and generating insights that help Stripe attract, develop, and retain our most important asset - our Stripes.

As a team, we’re a group of individuals with diverse backgrounds across consulting, HR, and other data-focused domains who are curious, passionate, and obsessed with using science and data to deliver high-value precise outputs to our users.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and present comprehensive analysis to influence and enable decision-making
Collaborate seamlessly with cross functional partner teams, internal stakeholders, and business leaders
Contribute valuable insights to our People Organization to improve our evolving processes and programs
Design, build and enable the delivery of analytics products through our BI, visualization, and analytics platforms including Tableau, Visier and Saratoga
Identify, build, validate, enable and upkeep people metrics
Conduct ad hoc analyses received through intake requests from partner teams
Partner with data engineering to identify and execute improvements against our existing workforce data ecosystem



Who you are

We’re looking for an analytics leader who will help us in our ongoing journey to build a world class People Analytics team and improve the overall employee experience and productivity of our Stripes. You are someone who is curious, has an eye towards craftsmanship and enjoys working in a fast-paced environment. Through your work, you will likely need to partner closely with our People Research & Insights team, People Partners, People Org teams, and Business teams to identify opportunities for greatest impact - then deliver value through creative problem-solving, actionable insights, and effective people practices. Examples of projects this individual may lead include evaluating interview effectiveness, collaborating with Finance to forecast hiring costs and volumes in new geographies, and developing dashboards focused on opportunities to improve return to office.

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience working in management consulting or analytics (people analytics experience is a plus)
Strong data visualization skills - must be able to create clean visuals that highlight key findings and tell a compelling story
Experience communicating technical concepts clearly, with all audiences
Experience with multiple data analysis and visualization tools (Tableau and Visier preferred); experience with a scripting language (Python or R) is a plus
Experience with human capital benchmarking and target setting
Flexible and comfortable with ambiguity (our environment changes rapidly, and your work might too!).
Knowledge of data architecture, design, development, and QA/QC processes
Ability to manage competing priorities and timelines to deliver high-quality solutions, as-promised and on-time



Preferred Qualifications


A bias toward automation and efficiency, with the know-how to cleanly structure data to enable continuous delivery of insights
A desire to promote self-service capabilities for stakeholders
You have operated across the full lifecycle of analytics projects - requirements gathering, data collection, data cleansing, analysis, visualization, QA/QC, and deployment
You have a bias towards action and an ability to iterate towards an end state
Stay up to date on best practices, scientific findings, and case studies in the world of people analytics and measurement
You can bring structure to ambiguity



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $130,900 - $196,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

To achieve this goal, we believe the traditional data warehouse architecture will be replaced by the new Data Intelligence Platform built on the Lakehouse, an open platform that unifies data warehousing and advanced analytics. The GTM Sr. Data Analyst will leverage the Data Intelligence Platform to deliver analytics utilizing our GTM data.

Reporting to the Director, GTM Data Governance & Analytics, the Senior Data Analyst will provide support in the form of data and analytics to both support the greater Strategy and Operations team as well as teams in the field. Support can mean building dashboards, developing curated reporting tables or reports, building forecasts, ad-hoc analysis or other simple models, all with the intention of providing visibility and insight to the field and their businesses.

The role will require technical and project management skills including the ability to work independently and the ability to partner with stakeholders including GTM leaders and others within the broader analytics community. Understanding the technology stack and how the data flows between systems (Salesforce, Xactly, ZoomInfo, etc.) is crucial. The analyst will become an expert on using the Databricks platform and complimentary technologies for analyzing data and presenting insight.

The Impact You Will Have


Build: You will develop analytic tools including dashboards, tables, analyses, and models that will be used by hundreds of employees in the field (technical and non-technical sales) as well as leaders across the globe
Project Manage: You will both manage the requirements gathering and lead execution of strategic analytic projects
Relationships: You will build and manage relationships with stakeholders across the company but primarily with the strategy and operations team
Use Databricks: You will work everyday with a variety of data using Databricks’ Data Intelligence Platform


What We Look For


You have 5+ years of experience working as an Analyst with B2B sales, marketing, or finance data.
You are technical and fluent in data. You have intermediate to advanced knowledge of different visualization tools (Tableau, Databricks AI/BI) and SQL. You have experience with Salesforce or equivalent CRM systems. Experience with CRM Analytics or Databricks (or equivalent technologies) as well as python is a plus.
You have a passion and eye for data, visualization, and UX. You enjoy building dashboards and analyses in order to derive actionable insights from data. Although we focus first on accuracy and integrity of the data, you enjoy going further because you care about the user experience and eventual impact of the tools you build.
You thrive in partnership with the business. You understand how the business works and how your work impacts the wider GTM team. You seek to understand the “why” behind the requests that you receive and create innovative solutions for business problems.
You excel in a collaborative environment. You translate team member needs into clear tasks and deliverables for contributors. You work through dependencies, bottlenecks, and tradeoffs with ease. You have a service-oriented mindset. You are curious, creative, and kind.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

As Notion continues to grow rapidly, we're seeking talented data engineers to join our team and help us build foundational datasets and pipelines, as well as the infrastructure that supports them. Your work will accelerate the decision-making process of key product and business functions. If you're passionate about analytics use cases, data models, and solving complex data problems, then this is the team for you!

What You'll Achieve


You'll define the processes and ETL infrastructure to transform and make data readily available across the company
You'll build core datasets to serve as unique sources of truth for product and business functions (product, marketing, sales, finance, customer experience, data science, business operations, IT, engineering)
You'll partner with data scientists and other internal stakeholders to understand their needs and then design, build and monitor pipelines that meet today's requirements but can gracefully scale with our growing data size
You'll implement automated workflows that lower manual/operational cost for stakeholders, define and uphold SLAs for timely delivery of data, move the company closer to democratizing data and a self-serve model (query exploration, dashboards, data catalog, data discovery)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You are a self-starter and continuously gather and synthesize high-impact needs from business partners, designing and implementing the appropriate technical solutions, and effectively communicating about deliverables, timelines and tradeoffs
You've spent 4+ years as a data engineer building core datasets and supporting business verticals as needed. You are passionate about analytics use cases, data models and solving complex data problems
You have hands-on experience shipping scalable data solutions in the cloud (e.g AWS, GCP, Azure), across multiple data stores (e.g Snowflake, Redshift, Hive, SQL/NoSQL, columnar storage formats) and methodologies (e.g dimensional modeling, data marts, star/snowflake schemas)
You are a SQL expert. You intimately understand aggregation functions, window functions, UDFs, self-joins, partitioning and clustering approaches to run correct and highly-performant queries
You are highly comfortable with object-oriented programming paradigms (e.g Python, Java, Scala)



Nice To Haves


You’ve worked at a fast-growing company, a SaaS company or are eager to contribute in such an environment (being a current Notion user would also be great!)
You have hands-on experience in designing and building highly scalable and reliable data pipelines using BigData stack (e.g Airflow, DBT, Spark, Hive, Parquet/ORC, Protobuf/Thrift, etc)



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $170,000 - $235,000 per year.

Inspired by our belief that anyone can learn anything and powered by our own curiosity, we build the smartest tools we can imagine to help students learn.

We’re on track to become the undisputed leader in user-generated learning content and engagement, at the scale of YouTube.

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is €85,400 - €128,200. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Pay and benefits

This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.
