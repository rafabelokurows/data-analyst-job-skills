We're making Africa the first cashless continent.

In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.

We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.

Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in.....

How you'll help us achieve it

We’re looking for an expert in statistical analysis focused on Experimentation and Causal Inference to join the Growth team at Wave. In this role, you will design, run, and analyze experiments in collaboration with product and operations teams to improve the product and customer experience.

In this role you will

Be embedded closely with our operations and product teams.
Generate insights using customer, merchant and agent data, which will include running power analyses, statistical modeling, and data visualization.
Design, implement and analyze experiments to evaluate the causal impact of new product features, promos, and operational process changes.
Design causal inference analysis plans using longitudinal data.
Explore large data sets to identify growth drivers and generate testable hypotheses.
Build and apply machine learning models to improve product features and to analyze heterogeneous treatment effects (e.g. using random forests and related methods).
Take ownership of the analytics process - from project scoping and design through communicating findings to stakeholders.

Key Details

You can work remotely from anywhere (between UTC -5 and +2) with reliable internet access.
You’re willing to travel to one of our key markets once per year for ~6 days (Wave covers all costs). We also provide a yearly stipend of $800 to meet with coworkers.
Our salaries are competitive and are calculated using a transparent formula. For this role, depending on your level, we offer a salary of up to $134,400 USD (paid in your local currency equivalent), plus a generous equity package.
We run performance reviews twice a year and award bonuses or promotions to strong performers who have been with the company for more than six months.
Major benefits:
Subsidized health insurance for you and your dependents and retirement contributions (both vary from country to country).
6 months of fully paid parental leave and subsidized fertility assistance.
Flexible vacation, with most folks taking between 30-40 days per year.
$10,000 annual charitable donation matching.

Requirements

Education and Experience
Minimum Bachelor's degree in a quantitative field such as Statistics, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Social Science, Applied Psychology, or a related discipline. A Master's or PhD is a plus.
5+ years experience in applied data analytics or similar experience.

(This is where we brag about being recognised as one of the 'Top 100 Best Places to Work')




You can see more of what we're about at spinbrands.com and take a peek at our smiling faces on our 'About Us' page.




The Role

Less about us, more about you.

Ready to join our dynamic and rapidly expanding Performance team?

Join us as a Data Analyst and be at the forefront of the data-driven revolution in marketing! Reporting directly to the Performance Director, you’ll be contributing to our rapid growth and success. You'll dive deep into data from platforms like Google, Meta, and TikTok to unearth insights that shape campaigns. If you're keen to kickstart your career in a vibrant, fast-paced environment, we want to hear from you!




Here’s what you’ll be doing...

Data Integrations through Funnel: Our analytics platform has hundreds of millions of data points that we use to guide our understanding of campaign performance. You'll work on integrating data from multiple sources through Funnel, ensuring that the data is accurate and accessible for analysis. - We need you to help us understand!
Report Creation and Maintenance: You'll create and maintain Looker Studio reports that provide valuable insights that are crucial for decision-making within the organisation on a daily basis. Your role will include making continual improvements to ensure the reports are as accurate and useful as possible. - Get as creative as you’d like!
Experimentation: (Not in a science lab we promise) Running structured experiments is a key part of how the Spin team works across paid and organic social. You’ll be responsible for identifying testing opportunities, working with account managers to implement them, managing rewards from advertising partners, and communicating test results.
Data analysis: Our team helps answer the most fundamental questions in marketing: is it working, and why. We use incrementality studies to understand the impact our marketing efforts are having on our clients’ businesses, and deep-dive into trends using spreadsheets and Python notebooks - You love the details, the nitty gritty, you probably wanted to be a detective when you were younger!
Tracking: Our analysis relies on good quality data. You'll be responsible for helping our clients track events across various platforms. This will often involve auditing tracking setup, building tracking maps and helping our clients troubleshoot.




Here’s what we need from you...

You'll be highly proficient in using spreadsheets, as they will be a fundamental tool in your day-to-day responsibilities - Spreadsheets are what dreams are made of!
The ability analyse data to answer questions and surface insights to a high standard, and present them visually and clearly
You'll be part of a team and may need to present your findings, so the ability to communicate clearly and effectively is crucial - We don’t bite!
Given that you'll be handling data and generating reports, a keen eye for detail is essential to ensure the accuracy and reliability of your work
Knowledge of how marketing data works is critical to the success of this role - It’s a complex game and we love it!
Experience with SQL, JavaScript, or Python would be highly desirable and give you a significant advantage in performing more complex data analyses.
Previous experience working with Google Tag Manager, Meta Pixel, and Google Analytics would make you stand out as a candidate. Familiarity with any paid media management tools would also be a plus.
Knowledge and experience running A/B test and reporting your findings to the team
A keen interest in the emerging trends and technologies of AI and using it to measure metrics for organic and paid social
An excellent understanding of how paid social and organic social analysis can be applied to campaigns - The best of both worlds!




The Perks

A chance to play a part and make a difference in a young, rapidly developing agency whilst building your career.
Celebrate the company’s wins with our bonus scheme - earn up to an impressive 20% additional salary. Cha-ching!
Embrace the freedom of our flexi-working policy. No need to ask permission; grab your laptop, kick back in your favourite spot, and let the productivity flow from the comforts of home.
Explore the world with our remote working policy, allowing you to work from anywhere (yes, even abroad!) for a whole month each year.
Enjoy a well-deserved 25 days of holiday
Look after your mental health with access to Spill Chat, a support app that connects you with real-life therapists.
Look forward to Fridays with 4 PM finishes. Start your weekend early and recharge those batteries.
Put your health as a #1 priority with our excellent healthcare package.
Bond with the team with team outings, monthly social events, and an epic annual trip. We know how to have fun; trust us.

Along with Jim Hays, Neil saw the opportunity to build a differentiated service provider at Lloyd’s.

Here you will work with the rest of the Data Insights team as well as data engineers and other data specialists to drive the next versions of our data services.

Use the team’s tools for work tracking and version control to make sure all finished work is supportable.
Develop reporting, analysis, and data visualisation solutions as part of a companywide MI portfolio.
Where requirements need wider data engineering and architecture support, document requirements and design information to be communicated into the wider team.
Challenge where requests for reporting and analysis go against our company data strategy or deviate from our data standards and processes.
Use your skills and data knowledge to coach, train, and support colleagues in the adoption of data analysis self-service.
Set expectations for and monitor data quality within reports and analysis, feeding back to the wider data function when anomalies are found.
Work within our data governance processes to implement common data definitions and best practices.
Understand how business processes can affect data quality via key source systems and help raise awareness to colleagues with data ownership responsibilities.
Keep our colleagues aware of the latest developments and capabilities in the Data Solutions, Data Insights, and wider data community.


What we are looking for:


Power BI report development including DAX.
Transact SQL and Python/Scala Scripting
Stakeholder management skills including requirements capture.
General analytical and modelling techniques
General data visualization and dashboard design techniques


What you will get in return:

As well as your salary, this role offers a discretionary bonus plus a broad range of benefits, including Non-Contributory Pension, Private Medical & Travel Insurance.

Our Commitment to Inclusion:

Apollo is a growing and diverse team of empowered and passionate experts who focus on bringing innovation, data driven decision making and collaboration to every relationship and every risk. To meet the needs of a demanding global insurance market, we need a diverse workforce that truly understands the international communities we serve.

That is why we're focused on developing diverse talent at every level; inclusion and diversity means more to us than just chasing a target and we are committed to supporting and celebrating difference. Our people are at the heart of our business which is why we value the diversity of thought and talent of every member of our team.

We offer a range of support and run a programme of events and training that recognise the challenges and opportunities relating to diversity.

Apollo is an independent specialist (re)insurer launched in 2009 to provide high quality products and services to clients, brokers, and capital partners at Lloyd’s. The Apollo name recognised the success of one of its founding investors Neil Armstrong, who in 1969 was the first person to land on the moon. Along with Jim Hays, Neil saw the opportunity to build a differentiated service provider at Lloyd’s.




Today, Apollo is a team of more than 250 colleagues, servicing clients, partners, and brokers from across the globe through its unique augmented underwriting approach.




“We attract and retain the highest quality talent by developing a team atmosphere where opportunity exists for our employees and partners.” David Ibeson, Group CEO




Your Role:




Apollo is establishing a set of truly innovative data services to propel our business to the next level. We are capturing, transforming, and analysing a vast variety of data through a modern cloud-based data platform to produce fabulously rich insight for our business. However, we need an enthusiastic, skilful, and creative Data Insights Analyst to join the team to make this happen!




This role will be a key part of the Data Insights team by getting hands-on with our data and collaborating directly with teams across the business to deliver the information they need. You will need to bring the best of your data analysis skills to deliver this, either through designing repeatable reports or creating ad-hoc pieces of analysis and analytics projects.




By working directly with the business, you will be in the perfect place to listen to their thoughts and ideas and be able to bring them back into our wider data team. Here you will work with the rest of the Data Insights team as well as data engineers and other data specialists to drive the next versions of our data services.




The data space is ever evolving so there will also be lots of opportunity to gain experience, new skills and try innovative ways to analyse and visualise our information.




What you’ll do:




Work with colleges across Apollo under understand their requirements for data analysis and management information.
Contribute to the prioritisation of work within the team.
Work as part of an Agile delivery process to complete both BAU and project work within the Data Insights team
Use the team’s tools for work tracking and version control to make sure all finished work is supportable.
Develop reporting, analysis, and data visualisation solutions as part of a companywide MI portfolio.
Where requirements need wider data engineering and architecture support, document requirements and design information to be communicated into the wider team.
Challenge where requests for reporting and analysis go against our company data strategy or deviate from our data standards and processes.
Use your skills and data knowledge to coach, train, and support colleagues in the adoption of data analysis self-service.
Set expectations for and monitor data quality within reports and analysis, feeding back to the wider data function when anomalies are found.
Work within our data governance processes to implement common data definitions and best practices.
Understand how business processes can affect data quality via key source systems and help raise awareness to colleagues with data ownership responsibilities.
Keep our colleagues aware of the latest developments and capabilities in the Data Solutions, Data Insights, and wider data community.




What we are looking for:




Power BI report development including DAX.
Transact SQL and Python/Scala Scripting
Stakeholder management skills including requirements capture.
General analytical and modelling techniques
General data visualization and dashboard design techniques




What you will get in return:




As well as your salary, this role offers a discretionary bonus plus a broad range of benefits, including Non-Contributory Pension, Private Medical & Travel Insurance.




Our Commitment to Inclusion:




Apollo is a growing and diverse team of empowered and enthusiastic experts who focus on bringing innovation, data driven decision making and collaboration to every relationship and every risk. To meet the needs of a demanding global insurance market, we need a diverse workforce that understands the international communities we serve.




That is why we are focused on developing diverse talent at every level; inclusion and diversity means more to us than just chasing a target and we are committed to supporting and celebrating difference. Our people are at the heart of our business which is why we value the diversity of thought and talent of every member of our team.




We offer a range of support and run a programme of events and training that recognise the challenges and opportunities relating to diversity.




Hybrid & flexible working:




At Apollo, hybrid and flexible working is fully embraced and we do not see the benefit of presenteeism. We understand that no two colleagues are alike, and as such we support the ability to remain agile and achieve a home and work balance to best suit business and personal commitments.




Reasonable Adjustments:




We want everyone to have equal access to our recruitment and selection processes so please take a few moments to complete our Candidate profile to identify any support or adjustments you may require during the recruitment process https://cleartalents.com/apply/Apollo-tv1680005409/

We started Marshmallow when we found out how unfair insurance prices are for people who move to the UK. All because the industry hasn’t given this huge cohort of people a second’s thought, and isn’t set up to price them properly.

We saw an opportunity to do things differently, so we made it our mission to back the ones who step outside the norm. Since we started, we’ve helped 100,000s of people get a fairer deal on their car insurance. Using technology, we serve people that are often overlooked by financial services companies, solving important problems for people who need it most.

We know there are millions of marginalised customers out there. And we know that they face unique problems that most companies aren’t even aware of. We believe that our future is helping these people by learning about their experiences, and building our company around their needs. And there are strong signs that there’s a need for a company like us. Earlier this year we hit profitability, which is a huge milestone, but the most exciting thing is that we’re only just getting started.

How We Work

We’re really proud of the culture we’ve created. We push for progress every day, because we know that we’ll only hit big milestones by taking lots of smaller steps. We’re always open to helping our team mates, sharing our ideas, experience and knowledge to solve problems together. We take risks, think creatively and experiment relentlessly to meet our customer’s needs, and never pass blame when things go wrong. We encourage people at all levels to take ownership of their work, and to be bold in challenging how we do things. Everyone has a voice and the opportunity to make an impact.

And autonomy and ownership are only possible with clear direction. That’s why we collaborate to do in-depth planning twice a year, and make sure we leave with clear goals and objectives that flow from top to bottom. To make sure we’re as aligned as possible across functions, most of our work rolls up into four tribes; Acquisition, Retention, Claims and Pricing, Underwriting & Fraud. Each tribe has multiple teams embedded in it, working cross-functionally to do great work.

We’re so excited for all of the challenges up ahead, and we need more people to help us tackle them! If life at Marshmallow sounds like it could be for you, explore our culture handbook or read our blog to find out more.

We stand up for individuality. We actively foster an inclusive workplace where diversity and individual difference are valued and leveraged to achieve the agency’s vision. And most importantly we value every individual’s wellbeing.

As a diversity champion, equal opportunities and disability confident employer and an ardent advocate of flexible working we understand that everyone has unique requirements and needs.

We are a global creative agency, but the individual really is at the heart of everything we do. We use data to find out what makes them tick. We use technology to talk to them one-to-one – but to one million at a time. And we use creativity to encourage them to engage, click, buy and bond, again and again.

Each brand is unique and has its own individual challenges. We pride ourselves in rising to each and every one of them, for brands such as KFC, Mercedes Benz, IKEA, Paypal and Virgin Media 02.

Us

In order to foster collaboration and relationships, our hybrid model requires three office days per week. As equal opportunities proponents, we are open to discuss any hybrid working related needs during the initial screening.

Learning and Development is important. We all know that. Its why we have a dedicated Learning and Development team and offer regular career conversations and bespoke L&D programmes so that you can leave us with more than when you started.

We recognise that the work of diversity, equity and inclusion calls on all of us. That’s why we set up The Neighbourhood. A collective of people, at different stages of the DE&I journey, whether impacted or allies, dedicated to helping our colleagues take ownership and effect change across 4 key pillars; Anti-racism, Disability, Gender & LGBTQ+ and Parents & Carers.

The Health and Wellbeing of our people matters immensely. We offer Coaching opportunities for all through our partnerships with Sanctus (mental health partner who provides online coaching; you can talk about anything, personal or professional) and Sayge (1:1 professional development coaching program). We have 40 trained Mental Health First Aiders across the agency and have Babylon Health (Private GP service) for all.

You’re better at work when you feel better in yourself. So, in addition to your annual holiday, you can take a “Me” day and an “Us” day, every year. Your “Me” day is for you to invest in yourself – go after a life goal, meditate, learn to paint, bake cakes or just have a duvet day watching Netflix!

Your “Us” day is all about giving back and helping others – volunteer, pick litter at a local park, hang out with the elderly or raise money for a local charity.

We’re progressive and always open to new initiatives, for example we’ve recently partnered with Fertifa (Leading Fertility and Reproductive Health benefit providers). Because we know the journey to becoming a family isn’t always easy (that includes men too), and we support our people through that journey whether you are new parent, experiencing the menopause, or anything else in between.

Whatever stage of life you are at, we make sure you have the tools you need to have a healthy work life balance.

US MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

Your Role

Your experience with web and social analytics tools (GA / Adobe / Brandwatch / Sprinklr) and data visualisation tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker / etc) will enable you to uncover key insights across channels and create self-service dashboards.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$147,900 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We go beyond software. Carbon6 is building a community to support ecommerce sellers by removing the barriers to selling online and simplifying their path to success. Developed by the brightest minds in the marketplace ecosystem, our suite of software tools and resources help entrepreneurs succeed at every stage of their journey. We are a global company across North America, Europe and Asia, made up of passionate entrepreneurs, expert sellers, and innovative thought leaders.

Founded in 2021, we have raised close to $100 million and quickly grown into a market leader. We work with the largest and most successful sellers, brands, agencies, and aggregators around the world to drive growth, maximize profitability and manage with intelligence to scale their businesses. In addition to collaborating with global giants such as Amazon, Walmart, Alibaba, and others, we foster partnerships with key industry players like BigCommerce, Teikametrics, Jungle Scout, and more. Through our innovative solutions and strategic alliances, we empower businesses of all sizes to excel in today's competitive landscape, driving success and fostering long-term growth for both our clients and partners.

The Opportunity (Hybrid)

Do you look at spreadsheets and think… why is this clearer? More actionable? Enhanced with meaningful visualizations? Do you stare at rows of data and love looking for and finding patterns? Is there a joy you find when you take an unordered collection of raw information and turn it into something meaningful, and better yet, see others use what you’ve created to make great decisions? If these all ring true to you, then you just might be the Data Analyst that we’re looking for.

Carbon6 is searching for a Data Analyst for our best-of-breed, multi-million dollar Amazon reimbursements and recovery tool. In this role, you’ll have a massive influence on the decisions that our internal team and our customers make–many who are themselves million-dollar Amazon sellers. This role is hands-on, and far more than just creating charts and graphs through a BI tool. You’ll be deeply involved in our data collection, migration, aggregation, analysis, and automation.

Your Responsibilities


Metrics Development: Define and establish key metrics that matter to our organization, and drive toward calculating those metrics across massive and often disparate datasets, both internal and external.
Data Integration: Identify and integrate new data sources into our data ecosystem to enhance our analytical capabilities from key Amazon, Walmart, and key third parties across the ecommerce ecosystem
Cross-functional Collaboration: Work closely with sales, operations, and of course product and engineering to understand their data needs and prioritize them in line with business goals
Data Processing: Leverage SQL to transform raw data into actionable insights, continuously optimizing our data platform for improved performance and scalability
Automation and Quality Assurance: Build trust in our data through robust automation and data quality processes that ensure that we never expose invalid or inaccurate data to your internal and external consumers
Data Visualization: Use your skills in BI tools (PowerBI, Tableau, Sisense, or similar) to create compelling reports and dashboards that support data-driven decisions, going beyond basic informatics to reveal key insights and drive decision making
Ad-hoc Solutions: Develop quick, temporary data solutions for immediate needs while contributing to long-term data infrastructure
Documentation: Ensure that all data processes and solutions are well-documented and sustainable for future use





Your Qualifications


Practical Experience: Solid track record as an Intermediate/Senior Data Analyst for a minimum of 4 years, actively involved in crafting and sustaining data analytics in complex settings
SQL Expertise: Proficient in SQL, including data modeling and crafting advanced queries
Business Intelligence Tools: Experienced in using BI tools like PowerBI, Tableau, or Sisense to visualize data and build dashboards
Detail-oriented: Strong attention to detail, with a passion for solving complex data challenges and ensuring data accuracy
Best Practices: Comprehensive grasp of data analysis principles, methodologies, and tools, encompassing data retrieval, staging, and visualization
Analytical Skills: Exceptional analytical prowess, coupled with the capability to dissect intricate data compilations and extract significant interpretations
Teamwork and Communication: Adept at seamlessly collaborating with diverse teams and stakeholders
Agile: Proven experience working on an Agile team with 1- or 2-week sprints, Scrum, and daily standups.
BONUS: Amazon Vendor/Seller Central experience either directly or through APIs





Perks & Benefits
🚀 As an early member of our team, you'll receive competitive compensation and a generous stock option plan.

🦷 Extended health benefits including Medical, Dental, and Vision starting on Day 1.

🌴 Flexible paid time off that includes paid vacation days and paid personal days.

💻 You'll receive a laptop conveniently delivered to your door to get you started and set up for success Day 1.

The Opportunity (Hybrid)

Do you look at spreadsheets and think… why is this clearer? More actionable? Enhanced with meaningful visualizations? Do you stare at rows of data and love looking for and finding patterns? Is there a joy you find when you take an unordered collection of raw information and turn it into something meaningful, and better yet, see others use what you’ve created to make great decisions? If these all ring true to you, then you just might be the Data Analyst that we’re looking for.

Carbon6 is searching for a Data Analyst for our best-of-breed, multi-million dollar Amazon reimbursements and recovery tool. In this role, you’ll have a massive influence on the decisions that our internal team and our customers make–many who are themselves million-dollar Amazon sellers. This role is hands-on, and far more than just creating charts and graphs through a BI tool. You’ll be deeply involved in our data collection, migration, aggregation, analysis, and automation.

Your Responsibilities


Metrics Development: Define and establish key metrics that matter to our organization, and drive toward calculating those metrics across massive and often disparate datasets, both internal and external.
Data Integration: Identify and integrate new data sources into our data ecosystem to enhance our analytical capabilities from key Amazon, Walmart, and key third parties across the ecommerce ecosystem
Cross-functional Collaboration: Work closely with sales, operations, and of course product and engineering to understand their data needs and prioritize them in line with business goals
Data Processing: Leverage SQL to transform raw data into actionable insights, continuously optimizing our data platform for improved performance and scalability
Automation and Quality Assurance: Build trust in our data through robust automation and data quality processes that ensure that we never expose invalid or inaccurate data to your internal and external consumers
Data Visualization: Use your skills in BI tools (PowerBI, Tableau, Sisense, or similar) to create compelling reports and dashboards that support data-driven decisions, going beyond basic informatics to reveal key insights and drive decision making
Ad-hoc Solutions: Develop quick, temporary data solutions for immediate needs while contributing to long-term data infrastructure
Documentation: Ensure that all data processes and solutions are well-documented and sustainable for future use





Your Qualifications


Practical Experience: Solid track record as an Intermediate/Senior Data Analyst for a minimum of 4 years, actively involved in crafting and sustaining data analytics in complex settings
SQL Expertise: Proficient in SQL, including data modeling and crafting advanced queries
Business Intelligence Tools: Experienced in using BI tools like PowerBI, Tableau, or Sisense to visualize data and build dashboards
Detail-oriented: Strong attention to detail, with a passion for solving complex data challenges and ensuring data accuracy
Best Practices: Comprehensive grasp of data analysis principles, methodologies, and tools, encompassing data retrieval, staging, and visualization
Analytical Skills: Exceptional analytical prowess, coupled with the capability to dissect intricate data compilations and extract significant interpretations
Teamwork and Communication: Adept at seamlessly collaborating with diverse teams and stakeholders
Agile: Proven experience working on an Agile team with 1- or 2-week sprints, Scrum, and daily standups.
BONUS: Amazon Vendor/Seller Central experience either directly or through APIs

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$147,900 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

The Opportunity (Hybrid)

Do you look at spreadsheets and think… why is this clearer? More actionable? Enhanced with meaningful visualizations? Do you stare at rows of data and love looking for and finding patterns? Is there a joy you find when you take an unordered collection of raw information and turn it into something meaningful, and better yet, see others use what you’ve created to make great decisions? If these all ring true to you, then you just might be the Data Analyst that we’re looking for.

Carbon6 is searching for a Data Analyst for our best-of-breed, multi-million dollar Amazon reimbursements and recovery tool. In this role, you’ll have a massive influence on the decisions that our internal team and our customers make–many who are themselves million-dollar Amazon sellers. This role is hands-on, and far more than just creating charts and graphs through a BI tool. You’ll be deeply involved in our data collection, migration, aggregation, analysis, and automation.

Your Responsibilities


Metrics Development: Define and establish key metrics that matter to our organization, and drive toward calculating those metrics across massive and often disparate datasets, both internal and external.
Data Integration: Identify and integrate new data sources into our data ecosystem to enhance our analytical capabilities from key Amazon, Walmart, and key third parties across the ecommerce ecosystem
Cross-functional Collaboration: Work closely with sales, operations, and of course product and engineering to understand their data needs and prioritize them in line with business goals
Data Processing: Leverage SQL to transform raw data into actionable insights, continuously optimizing our data platform for improved performance and scalability
Automation and Quality Assurance: Build trust in our data through robust automation and data quality processes that ensure that we never expose invalid or inaccurate data to your internal and external consumers
Data Visualization: Use your skills in BI tools (PowerBI, Tableau, Sisense, or similar) to create compelling reports and dashboards that support data-driven decisions, going beyond basic informatics to reveal key insights and drive decision making
Ad-hoc Solutions: Develop quick, temporary data solutions for immediate needs while contributing to long-term data infrastructure
Documentation: Ensure that all data processes and solutions are well-documented and sustainable for future use





Your Qualifications


Practical Experience: Solid track record as an Intermediate/Senior Data Analyst for a minimum of 4 years, actively involved in crafting and sustaining data analytics in complex settings
SQL Expertise: Proficient in SQL, including data modeling and crafting advanced queries
Business Intelligence Tools: Experienced in using BI tools like PowerBI, Tableau, or Sisense to visualize data and build dashboards
Detail-oriented: Strong attention to detail, with a passion for solving complex data challenges and ensuring data accuracy
Best Practices: Comprehensive grasp of data analysis principles, methodologies, and tools, encompassing data retrieval, staging, and visualization
Analytical Skills: Exceptional analytical prowess, coupled with the capability to dissect intricate data compilations and extract significant interpretations
Teamwork and Communication: Adept at seamlessly collaborating with diverse teams and stakeholders
Agile: Proven experience working on an Agile team with 1- or 2-week sprints, Scrum, and daily standups.
BONUS: Amazon Vendor/Seller Central experience either directly or through APIs

You're a great fit if you have:

Appreciation for systems: You can connect the dots and figure out the best solution for Bench, not just the stakeholders you're working with

Startup hustle: You are highly motivated, proactive, comfortable with change and ambiguity. You have a humble, team-player attitude and are ready to pitch in wherever you are needed most

You'll get access to Inkblot Therapy's Employee and Family Assistance Program (EAP) that offers counseling and support, for you and family members, as well as professional development coaching, financial advice, legal advice and much more.
Bench has a number of Affinity Groups - groups of people who have shared identities and experiences! The purpose of these groups is to support underrepresented Benchmates and amplify their voices.
If you live in BC's Lower Mainland, you have the opportunity to work at home and in our downtown office location, depending on your preference! For some roles, we do require folks to be in the office regularly. We'll be sure to outline expectations during the interview process.
For folks working fully remote, we will provide additional solutions to bring teams together for collaboration and connection.
Whether you get to use the office or if you work remotely, you'll have access to our Home Office Setup Fund to ensure that you have everything you need to work comfortably from home, from day one.
You'll have the opportunity to work from somewhere other than your home province for up to 3 months, within a 12 month period.


Everyone has their own unique talents. Even if you don't meet 100% of the qualifications outlined above, tell us why you'd be a great fit for this role in your application.

We believe that unchecked biases disproportionately impact the most marginalized people in society—including but not limited to BIPOC, LGBTQ2S+ people, immigrants, and people with disabilities. We strongly encourage applications from people with these identities or other marginalized communities because we believe that without you, we are all less. If you are selected for an interview and require support during the process, including disability accommodation, we'll give you the opportunity to tell us when we contact you.

The Equity & Inclusion Office is committed to ensuring that UBC is a community in which human rights are respected and equity, diversity, and inclusion are integral to university life. Through its leadership, vision, and collaborative action, the Equity & Inclusion Office (EIO) will further UBC's commitment to excellence, equity, and mutual respect.

The successful candidate will have significant experience working with teams in complex and diverse environments, a deep understanding of Indigeneity and critical race theory, and is experienced in navigating difficult conversations relating to power, privilege, discrimination, conflict engagement, and equity and inclusion.

This role will support the work of the EIO, as the key individual responsible for analyzing, reporting, and supporting the collection of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) evidence and related data. The analyst will provide senior-level analytical support to executive officers, Deans, Directors, and the community. The analyst will provide equity, diversity, and inclusion analysis in support of planning, policy formulation, and decision-making activities. The analyst will plan, design, conduct, and implement major research projects and studies, interpret results, and make formal presentations. The core work of this position is the development of institutional data infrastructure (dashboards, data dictionaries, working groups, access protocols, etc.) needed to inform research, analysis, and evaluation across several strategic initiatives focused on EDI at UBC.

Organizational Status

The EDI Data Analyst position will work with two offices, the Equity & Inclusion Office (EIO) and the Planning and Institutional Research Office (PAIR). This position will report to the Manager, Data, Analysis, Reporting & Evaluation (DARE) at the EIO working in close coordination with the Associate Director(s), Student Experience, Evaluation and Research (SEER), and in PAIR. The day-to-day human resources will be supervised by the Manager, DARE, in the EIO. This position will work closely with data analysts in PAIR and Strategists in the EIO and will maintain connections with a broad spectrum of data stakeholders at UBC.

The incumbent is expected to interact with other office staff in the EIO and PAIR, with staff from other departments, senior academic officers including Vice-Presidents, Deans, Directors, Department Heads, Senate Committees, representatives of other universities, government bodies and representatives, and other higher education and university-related organizations.

Work Performed


Provide timely, accurate, and meaningful EDI information for use by senior administrative and academic officers and committees in the formulation of programs and the resolution of issues related to equity, diversity, and inclusion throughout the University.
Plan, design, develop, and implement analytic reports, and statistical information in areas such as employment equity, student experience and demographics, and equitable survey design.

Extract and synthesize data from a variety of university databases to produce statistical reports, and participate in the revision of databases or the design of new databases.
Provide advice and assistance to project team members and colleagues.
Consult with university units, including departments, faculties, and administrative units, with respect to their information requirements.
Take ownership of projects, plan timely resolutions, delegate and supervise project tasks, validate results, and communicate the results to stakeholders; to identify appropriate quality standards and ensure that processes are in place such that these are met.
Translate policy issues and/or problem areas into meaningful research studies or reports which appropriately illuminate these issues and provide guidance for decision-making.
Manage survey research projects, identify areas of concern, design questionnaires, determine samples, monitor returns, and report results to ensure acceptable scientific standards are used in the design of the survey and in sample selection and use descriptive and inferential statistics as appropriate to analyze results.
Communicate the results of complex EDI data analysis, whether by statistical summary, the visual display of quantitative information, tabular output, or written description.
Provide data, reports, and analyses in order to provide support on fiscal and budgetary matters.

Consequence of Error/Judgement

The position requires accurate knowledge of a wide range of university policies and procedures.

The Equity & Inclusion Office is committed to ensuring that UBC is a community in which human rights are respected and equity, diversity, and inclusion are integral to university life. Through its leadership, vision, and collaborative action, the Equity & Inclusion Office (EIO) will further UBC's commitment to excellence, equity, and mutual respect.

The successful candidate will have significant experience working with teams in complex and diverse environments, a deep understanding of Indigeneity and critical race theory, and is experienced in navigating difficult conversations relating to power, privilege, discrimination, conflict engagement, and equity and inclusion.

This role will support the work of the EIO, as the key individual responsible for analyzing, reporting, and supporting the collection of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) evidence and related data. The analyst will provide senior-level analytical support to executive officers, Deans, Directors, and the community. The analyst will provide equity, diversity, and inclusion analysis in support of planning, policy formulation, and decision-making activities. The analyst will plan, design, conduct, and implement major research projects and studies, interpret results, and make formal presentations. The core work of this position is the development of institutional data infrastructure (dashboards, data dictionaries, working groups, access protocols, etc.) needed to inform research, analysis, and evaluation across several strategic initiatives focused on EDI at UBC.

Organizational Status

The EDI Data Analyst position will work with two offices, the Equity & Inclusion Office (EIO) and the Planning and Institutional Research Office (PAIR). This position will report to the Manager, Data, Analysis, Reporting & Evaluation (DARE) at the EIO working in close coordination with the Associate Director(s), Student Experience, Evaluation and Research (SEER), and in PAIR. The day-to-day human resources will be supervised by the Manager, DARE, in the EIO. This position will work closely with data analysts in PAIR and Strategists in the EIO and will maintain connections with a broad spectrum of data stakeholders at UBC.

The incumbent is expected to interact with other office staff in the EIO and PAIR, with staff from other departments, senior academic officers including Vice-Presidents, Deans, Directors, Department Heads, Senate Committees, representatives of other universities, government bodies and representatives, and other higher education and university-related organizations.

Work Performed

The position must make responsible recommendations in dealing with policy issues and must be vigilant that the data produced are accurate. Errors in judgment could not only diminish the effectiveness of UBC in its leading role in the education and development of British Columbians, Canadians, and International Students but could result in considerable financial loss and the reduced stature and reputation of the university and its senior executives.
