This enterprise focuses on HR solutions that they provide to various organizations. They aim to become more data-driven, and you, as a motivated and enthusiastic Data Analyst, will help achieve this goal.

As a Data Analyst, you will join a data team of 10 people who work closely with colleagues in Spain, Romania, and Latvia. In these countries, you'll primarily collaborate with Data Engineers and Integration Engineers. Here you'll serve as a critical link between business needs and technical execution, engaging significantly with both organisational stakeholders and engineering teams.

You will spend about 40% of your time interacting with stakeholders to understand, document, and communicate their requirements. This requires strong communication skills to translate business needs into actionable insights.

Another 40% you are interacting with engineers by managing the Jira backlog, which includes epics and user stories. You'll refine these stories, make design decisions, and develop action plans to ensure successful delivery. Effective communication with geographically dispersed teams in Romania and Spain is crucial, facilitated through daily stand-ups and regular updates.

The rest of your duties involve creating dashboards using tools like Tableau or PowerBI. You will qualify data requests, collaborate with data engineers to extract and model data, and then develop dashboards from this structured information. This includes designing reports and visualisations that meet organisational needs.

Data, data en nog meer data

Onze klanten hebben en werken met data, veeeeeeeel data. Veel van deze data zit verstopt en blijft hiermee ongebruikt. Best zonde vind je niet? Aan jou om die data uit de krochten van de systemen te trekken en op zoek te gaan naar mogelijkheden om deze data in te zetten om de business (nog) beter te maken. Je gaat als het ware op zoek naar de schatten in deze verzameling aan data. Concreet kan je denken aan het verzamelen en structuren van data, het controleren en het verwerken van data waarbij je deze omzet naar informatie.




Naast dat je onze klanten helpt om meer datagedreven te werken, ga je meebouwen aan onze IT-tak. Beter gezegd, hoe wij onze kennis en expertise op het gebied van data analyse verder kunnen uitbreiden; intern en extern. Met elkaar ga je uitvinden wat jullie willen leren en hoe jullie dit gaan doen. Je neemt hierin de trekkende rol op je en vindt het leuk om onze junioren hierin mee te nemen.







Wie ben jij?

Je vindt het leuk om te werken met grote data sets en het uitvoeren van analyses;
Je hebt ervaring met Python, PowerBI, Azure en/of AWS;
Je houdt van het delen van je kennis, maar wil ook graag nieuwe dingen leren;
Je wilt graag meebouwen aan onze IT start-up;
Je bent op zoek naar een club collega’s waar aandacht, binding en betrokkenheid centraal staat.







Wat krijg je van ons?

Salaris vanaf € 3.526 (o.b.v. 40 uur) afhankelijk van jouw kennis ervaring;
Elektrische leaseauto, opleidingsbudget, team- en samenwerkdagen en andere leuke uitjes;
De mogelijkheid om jezelf verder te ontwikkelen met behulp van o.a. leerpaden, opleidingen en een coach-consultant;
Starten wanneer jij wil, maar hoe eerder, hoe beter.







Great Place To Work

Wéer een keurmerk? Dacht het niet, want een Great Place To Work word je niet zomaar. Sinds 2020 zijn wij een Great Place To Work-Certified en daar zijn wij natuurlijk super trots op! Door deze certificering weten wij dat onze collega’s met trots, plezier en vertrouwen aan ’t werk gaan. Zo vindt 96% van onze collega’s Ciratum alles overziend een Great Place To Work. Middels dit onderzoek weten wij precies wat er speelt. The good and the bad. En dat is oké, want zo kunnen wij dagelijks hard werken aan onze organisatiecultuur. Zo bouwen wij samen verder 🧡.

De functie

Je bent gedreven in het maken, analyseren en omzetten van data sets naar samenhangende informatie en dashboards. Met deze informatie worden overzichtelijke en heldere strategische rapportages, adviezen en presentaties gemaakt voor senior leadership, Corporate en Commercial. Je maakt gebruik van geavanceerde Excel bestanden, Power BI-dashboards en -oplossingen die continue door jou worden verbeterd en gedocumenteerd. Daarnaast optimaliseer en ontwikkel je nieuwe analysemethoden en modellen. Je hebt een nauwe samenwerking met de Business Modellers en Program Managers. Ook het periodiek aanvullen van databases met data, behoort tot één van jouw taken. Je levert een bijdrage aan verschillende projecten, waaronder de centralisatie van data-informatie en de overgang naar een nieuw softwarepakket. In deze software transitie zal jij onder andere de huidig gebruikte Excel files omzetten naar nieuwe formats. Je rapporteert aan de Director Sourcing & Capacity Planning.




Jouw profiel

Je bent een creatieve data cruncher, die grote data sets kan omtoveren tot bruikbare sturingsinformatie waarmee trends, scenario’s en relaties inzichtelijk kunnen worden gemaakt. Je wordt uitgedaagd door het creëren van geavanceerde Excel files. Excel en Power BI hebben geen geheimen voor jou. Van nieuwe methoden en tools (machine learning /Microsoft AI) maak jij gretig gebruik. Uiteraard vind je het prettig om nauw samen te werken met jouw collega’s en stakeholders. Als zelfsturende data professional krijg je vrijheid en ruimte om deze functie naar jouw eigen hand te zetten.

Een afgerond HBO- of WO-opleiding is een vereiste, bijvoorbeeld richting Supply Chain, Wiskunde, Engineering, ICT, Econometrie;
3 – 6 jaar ervaring met analysetechnieken en data-management in bij voorkeur een complexe internationale (supply chain) omgeving;
Excellente kennis en ervaring met Excel en Power BI (DAX is pré);
De Engelse taal beheers je uitstekend.

Abbott heeft een gedegen inwerktraject en je wordt vanuit de organisatie begeleid door een ervaren collega.

25 vakantiedagen en 12 ATV dagen;
8,33% vakantietoeslag;

At Mendix, we help our users and customers bring their ideas to outcomes.

Improving our product means we need to understand how our product is actually being used by our users and customers, how well do (new) features perform, what are opportunities for improvement based on that.

Questions around these topics do constantly live in the heads of our product teams and product managers who are responsible for growing the happy userbase and customers of our platform.

Besides our research teams who focus on qualitative user research, the product analytics team at Mendix is taking the quantitative angle.

We are responsible for creating and sharing product insights to support and guide those teams and product managers in making the right decisions, which are based on facts and data coming from our platform.

I rollen som Data Engineer med fokus på Java, Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery och dbt blir du en viktig del i att utveckla tekniken för att möjliggöra vår vision att skapa en bättre framtid för miljoner människor!




*Under sommaren kan återkoppling dröja längre än vanligt, urvalsarbetet kommer påbörjas senast V.33.*




Om teamet och rollen:

Hos oss har teamen stark autonomi i att välja teknik för plattformen och dess utveckling. Vi jobbar tillsammans för att ständigt förbättra arkitekturen, funktionaliteten och teamets effektivitet och välmående, allt för att på bästa möjliga sätt kunna skapa värde från stora mängder data.




En data engineer i vårt team förstår värdet i att ta in utvecklartänket i dataområdet. Det innebär versionshantering, testning och att se data som en produkt. Det gäller även att, med DevOps-tänk i ryggraden, kunna utveckla modern infrastruktur i molnet och hur den kan knytas till befintliga strukturer på ett säkert sätt.




I dataplattformsteamet är det väsentligt att ha djup förståelse för både den centrala tekniken och användarupplevelsen på plattformen. Vi arbetar ständigt för att förstå hur vi kan minska utvecklare och andra kollegors kognitiva last och effektivisera plattformen. Det ska vara enkelt att bygga kundvärde på Avanza!




Vi utvecklar kontinuerligt plattformen så att den blir mer strömlinjeformad, säker och automatiserad. Det är hög innovationstakt inom datavärlden och detta ger oss möjligheten att bygga bättre och häftigare lösningar kontinuerligt. Vi hoppas du vill följa med oss på denna roliga resa framåt!




Hos oss kommer du:

Sätta ramarna för dataprodukter i dbt, BigQuery, Docker, Python och andra verktyg
Javautveckling för integrering med Avanzas backend-appar via Kafka
Jobba med verktyg så som Terraform på GCP
Ta fram verktyg för effektiva förädlingsflöden och datapipelines
Arbeta med säkerhet och behörigheter för data
Utbilda kollegor i tekniker och arkitektur




Din profil:

En data engineer i vårt team förstår vikten av samarbete och värdet i att vara service minded då våra kunder är Avanzas egna utvecklingsteam, det betyder coachning och support runt dataförädling inom kundteamens egna domäner. Teamet driver även autonomt många av sina projekt och för att trivas i rollen behöver du våga att testa och trivas i att driva dina initiativ framåt.




Vi tror du:

Är erfaren och kunnig inom systemutveckling i Java
Erfarenhet av AWS, GCP eller liknande molnmiljö
Har kunskap inom modern infrastruktur och DevOps (CI/CD, Testautomatisering) och relaterated verktyg så som Terraform och Docker
Är väl förtrogen med en data engineers verktygslåda (t ex Python, SQL, dbt, Airflow, Prefect eller Great Expectations)
Har goda kunskaper i svenska, både i tal och skrift




Det är meriterande om du:

Deltagit i ML- eller ML-Ops-projekt
Har erfarenhet inom IT-säkerhet




Ansökan

Skicka gärna din ansökan snarast då urvalet sker löpande, dock senast den 11 Augusti. Vi tar inte emot ansökningar via mejl p.g.a. GDPR.




Välkommen med din ansökan!

Would you like to help Nordea drive customer-centric decision making? We are looking for a senior customer insight analyst with a flair for behavioural data and data analysis to support us in delivering some of the major customer satisfaction surveys at Nordea.

 

We are creating a work environment where we develop and adapt to what we observe, in order to keep the customer voice at the core of the business and grow together. To help with this objective, we need your ideas and unique background!

 

At Nordea, we see that the world is changing fast – and we want to help our customers to succeed by providing them with the financial solutions of tomorrow. 

 

About this opportunity:

Welcome to Customer Behavioural Insights, a truly Nordic team working across all four Scandinavian countries to deliver strategic customer insights based on both qualitative and quantitative methods, often in collaboration. We support internal departments ranging from strategic marketing, communication and branding, to business development, service- and product- strategy teams. The team is responsible for delivering overall key performance indicators of customer satisfaction at Nordea, together with other satisfaction measures such as brand perception. 

 

What you’ll be doing:

Support our team in delivering existing recurring customer surveys
Implement and test surveys in our survey tool
Continuously improve existing processes, methods and data outputs
Transform your findings into tangible business insights and simple, to the point visualizations
Communicate and present your insights to key stakeholders

You’ll join a team driven by curiosity and exploration, with team members from a broad range of academic backgrounds. All of us have a keen interest in learning new methods and to build upon each other’s areas of specialization. The position is based in Helsinki or Stockholm. 

 

Who you are:

Collaboration. Ownership. Passion. Courage. These are the values that guide us in being at our best – and that we imagine you share with us.

 

To succeed in this role, we believe that you:

Are more interested in what the numbers tell you than the numbers themselves. You have a sense for how to translate large data sets into actionable insights. Can think both analytically and intuitively to uncover user needs
Have a technical and mathematical mindset with attention to detail but do not lose focus on the overall goals
Are naturally curious and efficient minded, and whilst being meticulous you also constantly search for ways to improve processes and deliveries
Like to collaborate with others and thrive on feedback and continuous improvement
Build relations professionally across the organisation to improve your own work

Your experience and background:

Proven track record and experience working with quantitative research methods, including conducting and analysing surveys
Hands-on knowledge in applying data science and statistical methods to survey data - prior work with sampling and weighting methods is a plus
Working knowledge with statistical tools, especially R and/or willingness to learn R
Experience with content analysis of open comments is an advantage
Experience with presenting and communicating results to diverse audiences
Experience using Qualtrics is an advantage 
Fluency in one local Nordic language is also an advantage

 

 If this sounds like you, get in touch!

 

Next steps

 

Submit your application no later than 26/07/2024. Please be aware that any applications or CVs coming through email or direct messages will not be accepted or considered.

 

For more information, you’re welcome to contact recruiting manager Mats Leifler mats.leifler@nordea.se or Katrin Werner katrin.maren.werner@nordea.com Vacations during week 27-31. Interviews can start from week 32.

Most companies ramble on about purpose and making the world a better place. And pretty often it feels a bit… well, forced. But we’d like to think that our story is special for real.




Our founders, Shadi Bitar and Ninos Malki, came to Sweden from Syria when they were kids. Books became their compass, guiding them through the maze of life, and helping them shape their destinies in a new world.




Their dream was bold: What if they could unlock the world of books for everyone, making knowledge and inspiration accessible to all? Fast forward a few years, and the tale of Nextory was born.




At Nextory, we've crafted a revolutionary monthly subscription that empowers our users to devour books like never before, be it through reading or listening. It's not just a product; it's a passport to endless adventure and enlightenment.




And now, we're on a quest to find a Data Engineer, someone as passionate as we are about making the world a happier place and enriching lives through the world of reading. Join our extraordinary team, and let's script a future where every day is a chapter of discovery, and every book is a key to a richer life.




WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING

As a Data Engineer at Nextory you will work with keeping and developing the data drivenness of Nextotry throughout the organization. With a curious, innovative and analytical mindset and tech-savvy approach you will fuel our data-driven teams.




Together with the team you will be responsible for data services which means, data warehousing, ML/AI, data quality and enabling data insights. You will build and run data pipelines, data warehouses, data frameworks and leverage ML/AI. We believe that you enjoy working autonomously in close collaboration with the cross-functional teams and other stakeholders.




You will be a part of an amazing team and be at the core of understanding a consumer subscription service - always with the continuous aspiration to increase reading! The position is based in Stockholm and you report to our COO.




WHO YOU ARE

We believe that you are currently working in a similar role at a fast-moving company. We believe that you would like to develop a thorough understanding of how consumers use our service and be part of delivering key insights. By using various development techniques, you will keep us in the forefront of creating the best customer experience as well as providing a great self-service data platform. We believe that you take pride in structuring, integrating and transforming data on a daily basis - you believe that data quality is key!

If you have ambitions (or experience!) of working with areas like ML and AI we would love to give you a platform to show your practice! You thrive working in a dynamic and unpretentious environment where you take great responsibility for our product and your team!




SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS

• We believe you have, for the field, relevant educational background

• We believe you have around 4 years of experience from working within the field

• We believe that you are an expert in SQL and have worked with Java, Python and/or similar languages

• We believe that you have experience with cloud infrastructure (Azure, AWS, GCP) and cloud data warehousing, preferably BigQuery or equivalent

• We believe that you have experience working with pipelines and data integration solutions with an ELT approach

• We believe that you have experience in operating, maintaining and ensuring quality of production grade software




We are looking forward to your application which should include a CV or LinkedIn profile.

Vi värmer över 800 000 stockholmare och vårt 300 mil långa fjärrvärmenät är navet för de samhällsnyttor som vi skapar. Vi planerar att bygga en anläggning för koldioxidinfångning vid vårt biokraftvärmeverk i Värtan med potential att fånga in 800 000 ton koldioxid per år, vilket är mer än Stockholms vägtrafik släpper ut under samma period.

Som person är jag engagerad, transparent och brinner för att få saker gjorda. Jag tror på att arbeta tillsammans, vara prestigelös och se till allas bästa. Tillsammans strävar vi efter att inte bara uppnå höga prestationer utan också att säkerställa ett hållbart arbetsliv för alla.

Jag uppskattar att arbeta med personer som är lösningsorienterade, organiserade, kommunikativa och positiva.

Here are descriptions of working for Accenture form some of our super stars:

Simon: “I joined Accenture as a Data Engineer in Data & AI. Prior to joining Accenture most of my experience was built within startups, so joining Accenture was a bit different to what I was used to. Since joining I have spent most of my time in a large transformation project where I have held several roles and responsibilities. This has varied from business and data analysis to data engineering and report development.

Working at Accenture is a lot of fun! The pace is fast, and you are surrounded by skilled and driven people, meaning if you have questions it's super easy to reach out to someone for help or expertise. Furthermore, as an employer Accenture prioritizes development and encourages further education. This produces an environment where you can have a significant impact on your own career journey, with lots of opportunities to try new things and grow.

Besides project work there is a vibrant Accenture community which you can get involved with in many forms. Our own Data & AI hosts events and teambuilding activities, and we often combine events with other teams. These, along with the many Accenture wide communities and events make it easy to network and meet more people to collaborate with and learn from.”

Yasmin:

“I started my Accenture adventure in Paris, in 2018, as a data science intern. I was hands-on with deep learning and computer vision projects, developing prototypes and proofs of concept that contributed to our clients' innovation. With the industry's shift towards data-driven approaches, I moved into data engineering, focusing on cloud modernization and migrations. This shift provided me the opportunity to master various cloud technologies and scripting languages. In 2023, I relocated to Accenture Sweden, a country that had always intrigued me due to my previous Erasmus experience in Lund. My responsibilities expanded beyond client work to include co-leading our Data & AI community in Copenhagen and Malmö, hosting workshops/conferences/hackathons and engaging with our global Innovation and Ventures department.

What I appreciate most about Accenture is the opportunity to engage with various teams globally, which sets the opportunity to expand my horizons beyond my primary domain. Whether you are interested in sustainability, UX/UI, Gen AI, social initiatives, customers life trends, etc. there is something for each one of us.

If you are someone that is driven by curiosity and innovation, it is for sure one of the best places to be. In essence, my life at Accenture is an exciting journey, allowing me to explore new frontiers, much like an explorer charting new territories (just like my dream of setting foot on Mars). It's a role that demands technical skill, sustains continuous learning, and values community engagement.”

Would you like to help Nordea drive customer-centric decision making? We are looking for a senior customer insight analyst with a flair for behavioural data and data analysis to support us in delivering some of the major customer satisfaction surveys at Nordea.

 

We are creating a work environment where we develop and adapt to what we observe, in order to keep the customer voice at the core of the business and grow together. To help with this objective, we need your ideas and unique background!

 

At Nordea, we see that the world is changing fast – and we want to help our customers to succeed by providing them with the financial solutions of tomorrow. 

 

About this opportunity:

Welcome to Customer Behavioural Insights, a truly Nordic team working across all four Scandinavian countries to deliver strategic customer insights based on both qualitative and quantitative methods, often in collaboration. We support internal departments ranging from strategic marketing, communication and branding, to business development, service- and product- strategy teams. The team is responsible for delivering overall key performance indicators of customer satisfaction at Nordea, together with other satisfaction measures such as brand perception. 

 

What you’ll be doing:

Support our team in delivering existing recurring customer surveys
Implement and test surveys in our survey tool
Continuously improve existing processes, methods and data outputs
Transform your findings into tangible business insights and simple, to the point visualizations
Communicate and present your insights to key stakeholders

You’ll join a team driven by curiosity and exploration, with team members from a broad range of academic backgrounds. All of us have a keen interest in learning new methods and to build upon each other’s areas of specialization. The position is based in Helsinki or Stockholm. 

 

Who you are:

Collaboration. Ownership. Passion. Courage. These are the values that guide us in being at our best – and that we imagine you share with us.

 

To succeed in this role, we believe that you:

Are more interested in what the numbers tell you than the numbers themselves. You have a sense for how to translate large data sets into actionable insights. Can think both analytically and intuitively to uncover user needs
Have a technical and mathematical mindset with attention to detail but do not lose focus on the overall goals
Are naturally curious and efficient minded, and whilst being meticulous you also constantly search for ways to improve processes and deliveries
Like to collaborate with others and thrive on feedback and continuous improvement
Build relations professionally across the organisation to improve your own work

Your experience and background:

Proven track record and experience working with quantitative research methods, including conducting and analysing surveys
Hands-on knowledge in applying data science and statistical methods to survey data - prior work with sampling and weighting methods is a plus
Working knowledge with statistical tools, especially R and/or willingness to learn R
Experience with content analysis of open comments is an advantage
Experience with presenting and communicating results to diverse audiences
Experience using Qualtrics is an advantage 
Fluency in one local Nordic language is also an advantage

 

 If this sounds like you, get in touch!

 

Next steps

 

Submit your application no later than 26/07/2024. Please be aware that any applications or CVs coming through email or direct messages will not be accepted or considered.

 

For more information, you’re welcome to contact recruiting manager Mats Leifler mats.leifler@nordea.se or Katrin Werner katrin.maren.werner@nordea.com Vacations during week 27-31. Interviews can start from week 32.

Vi värmer över 800 000 stockholmare och vårt 300 mil långa fjärrvärmenät är navet för de samhällsnyttor som vi skapar. Vi planerar att bygga en anläggning för koldioxidinfångning vid vårt biokraftvärmeverk i Värtan med potential att fånga in 800 000 ton koldioxid per år, vilket är mer än Stockholms vägtrafik släpper ut under samma period.

Vi söker dig som vill ha en nyckelroll i att skapa automatiserade arbetsflöden och pipelines för att hämta, organisera och transformera data från olika källor. Vi är idagsläget i ett stadie där vi utvecklar och etablerar en ny dataplattform på MS Azure och Databricks.Som en del av teamet inom Data & Analytics skapar du förutsättningar för dataanalytiker och maskininlärningsingenjörer att bygga stabila analyslösningar- genom att se till att data finns på rätt plats, i rätt format och i rätt tid, korrekt modellerad och tillgängligt i bland annat Power BI. För den här rollen ser vi att du har god teknisk erfarenhet i dataplattformar, liksom en vana att hantera affärskrav och kommunicera med användare.

Rollen är en tillsvidareanställning och har sin utgångspunkt i Hjorthagen, Stockholm. Möjlighet till viss distansarbete finns.

Varför jobba med mig?

Jag tycker om att arbeta på Stockholm Exergi och vill vara med i arbetet mot en hållbar stad. Min prioritet är att det ska kännas schysst att gå till jobbet och att alla får möjlighet att vara den bästa versionen av sig själva. Som person är jag engagerad, transparent och brinner för att få saker gjorda. Jag tror på att arbeta tillsammans, vara prestigelös och se till allas bästa. Tillsammans strävar vi efter att inte bara uppnå höga prestationer utan också att säkerställa ett hållbart arbetsliv för alla.

Jag uppskattar att arbeta med personer som är lösningsorienterade, organiserade, kommunikativa och positiva.

Det handler om de mennesker, vi er, og den forskel, vi gør for vores kunder. Vi tror på at samarbejde og menneskelig forbindelse er alt, og lige nu søger vi en BI Specialist til en nyoprettet stilling i vores Datawarehouse team i Greve.

Hvad tilbyder vi

Er du nyuddannet og leder efter et sted hvor din læring og udvikling bliver taget godt hånd om så har vi stillingen til dig her.

Du får mulighed for at arbejde med spændende data, som du er med til at forbedre kvaliteten af, udvikle dine evner inden for BI og dataanalyse samt eksperimentere med AI.

I denne rolle bliver du en del af et team, hvor store ideer kan komme fra alle, og hvor vi støtter hinanden. Vi er her for at gøre et fantastisk stykke arbejde for vores kunder, og det er langt sjovere at gøre det som ét samlet hold. Hvis du er klar til at lære, dele og skubbe grænser, vil vi gerne have dig med på holdet.

Vi sætter frihed og fleksibilitet højt og tilbyder ugentlige hjemmearbejdsdage. Og hvis du sidder med en særlig interesse eller ønske for udvikling i en bestemt retning, så er vi åbne.

Hvad skal du lave

I teamet er vores arbejdsopgaver at understøtte forretningen med de nødvendige data i form af engangsanalyser og standardrapporter. Vores platform et p.t. baseret på et mix af on-premise SQL-databaser, eksternt driftede løsninger og egenudviklede løsninger som understøtter forretningsprocesserne i LEMAN.

For at understøtte forretningen bedst muligt, er vi i gang med at flytte vores eksisterende rapporteringsløsninger fra on-premise SQL-databaser til Microsoft Fabric platformen, som på sigt skal indeholde data fra samtlige datakilder i LEMANs nye Data Lake.

Dit arbejde vil komme til at bestå af at udvikle pipelines til flytning af data fra vores forskellige TMS (Transport Management System), ERP-system og diverse egenudviklede løsninger til den centrale Data Lake. Her kommer vi til at arbejde med at sørge for at data fra de forskellige systemer kan anvendes i en konform kontekst, og således understøtte forretningens ønske om at kunne blive mere selvhjulpne, når det kommer til at trække data ud af systemerne.

Dine Opgaver Kommer Til At Bestå Af


Udvikling af nye funktioner
Dialog med forretningen om nye funktioner
Support af brugerne
Analyse og fejlsøgning
Udforske nye muligheder AI ell. lign.


Hvem leder vi efter

Vi forestiller os, at du er nyuddannet og igennem uddannelsen har lært at:


Skrive grundlæggende forespørgsler i SQL
Skrive kode i Python til analyse af data
Arbejde med Machine Learning og AI
Arbejde med data fra flere kilder
Holde overblikket når datamængderne bliver store
Måske har lavet datapræsentation i Excel/Power BI
Gerne har kendskab til Azure Dev/OPS, Azure Data Factory, Delta Live Tables, Databricks og lignende nyere teknologier


LEMANs BI-Team er placeret i Group Digitalization & Applications, som er en afdeling der har til opgave at understøtte forretningen med de nødvendige systemer og implementere processerne for at arbejde optimalt med disse. Dine kollegaer i teamet har derfor et indgående kendskab til processerne i LEMAN, hvilket til sidst bliver til data bagved vores systemer.

I BI-Teamet vil I være to personer, og I vil sammen understøtte forretningen med data transformeret til brugbar information. Din kollega er en erfaren ressource indenfor BI miljøet, og du vil derfor ikke stå alene, men blive en del af et lille team i en velfungerende afdeling, hvor humor og afslappet arbejdsmiljø er en vigtig del af arbejdsdagen. Din nærmeste kollega vil sørge for at du får de relevante færdigheder for at kunne understøtte forretningen så BI-Teamet udadtil kommer til at fremstå som ét.

Som Person Forestiller Vi Os At Du


Har lyst til at lære en masse nye teknologier at kende
Elsker at være en del af et socialt forskelligt team og bidrager selv til en hyggelig stemning
Er nysgerrig, spørger ind og holder dig orienteret om hvad der sker omkring dig
Ikke bange for at komme med forslag til nye optimering af processer – nye øjne på sagerne bliver værdsat her!
Har evnen til at skabe overblik over et komplekst systemlandskab og samtidig have sans for detaljerne (er der afvigelser i data skal vi kunne opfange det)
Taler og skriver flydende dansk og/eller engelsk (no worries, if you don’t speak Danish but master English on a high level, we’d love to hear from you)


Nok om os. Nu vil vi gerne høre om dig! Vi behøver ikke en lang ansøgning, send blot dit CV med et par linjer om, hvorfor du finder stillingen interessant og hvorfor du mener, at det er dig vi skal have med på holdet. 

Vi modtager både ansøgninger på dansk og engelsk og har du nogle spørgsmål, er du mere end velkommen til at kontakte Ken Seitzberg, BI Arkitekt på ken.seitzberg@leman.com eller Mads Bjørn Hansen, Senior Manager Group Digitalization & Applications på mads.hansen@leman.com

Vi glæder os til at høre fra dig!

Then this is a great opportunity.

Your new role

In your new role, you will join the cross-functional serialization team. You will work alongside dedicated colleagues by handling various operational serialization tasks and maintaining the current processes. You will assist the organization in translating market-specific regulations into actions and ensure that Lundbeck is compliant with local regulations on serialization.

Your role will combine operational support, process ownership, and project management. You will be the focal point for our various business units and partners and support the organization in implementing serialization compliance initiatives globally while ensuring effective serialization processes cross-functionally.

You will be working on several activities within serialization, with the following focus areas:


Driving issue analysis and correction with production, IT, external partners, contract manufacturers, and solution providers - to support Supply Chain departments and Pharmaceutical Production
Data analysis and error trending on operations to identify improvement areas
Creating standard processes and guidelines in the Line of Business – in collaboration with the Serialization team, Corporate IT, and consultants
Driving small and medium projects and activities independently, and in collaboration with colleagues – with the possibility of driving larger projects further on



Your future team

You will join the Packaging Compliance and Master Data department which consists of 19 dedicated employees divided into 4 groups: Artwork, Master Data, Packaging Change Management, and Serialization. Together we ensure timely updates of artwork and master data for all Lundbeck products, as well as drive serialization for the whole organization and external partners.

Packaging Compliance and Master Data is a part of the division Pharmaceutical Production & Supply Chain, and we are based in Lundbeck’s headquarters in Valby. The division consists of +550 employees, located in Denmark and France, and we are responsible for the production and distribution of Lundbeck’s medical products.

As Serialization Data Analyst, you will report to the Senior Manager of Packaging Compliance & Master Data.

What You Bring To The Team

Our preferred candidate has the following professional qualifications:


A bachelor's or master’s degree in a relevant field (IT, engineering, supply chain management, business, or equivalent), and 0-3 years of experience
A structured approach to complex issues, with an analytic and goal-oriented mindset to independently establish solutions
Detail-oriented and deep understanding of data
Great communication- and stakeholder management skills
Experience in the Pharmaceutical industry (working with GMP and GXP), supply chain, and/or working with serialization is beneficial



Serialization is a niche, and while experience and knowledge within the field will be beneficial, it is not a requirement, and Lundbeck will provide thorough training. The most important thing is that you are willing to learn and have the desire to develop your competencies as well as having a desire to develop yourself and grow your area of expertise and responsibility.

You enjoy working with data and complex workflows. You are detail-oriented but also possess the ability to take the “helicopter” view of various ongoing projects and activities and naturally take the lead in solving complex challenges.

You are curious by nature; you are proactive, and you always try to find the best solution for our customers and Lundbeck overall.

You are a true team player and bring positivity to the office even in busy times. You enjoy having several different tasks (including day-to-day) and projects at the same time and are confident in communicating with colleagues on all levels in the organization.

Our promise to you

Lundbeck offers an inspiring workplace, passionate colleagues, and a culture characterized as collaborative – a must to successfully bring our treatments through research and development all the way to commercialization and the people who need them. We offer a mix of exciting tasks and numerous development opportunities that are balanced with initiatives focused on your well-being.

If yes, then keep on reading.

What’s the job about - and why it is attractive?

Grundfos is convinced that future competitiveness depends on the ability to apply Artificial Intelligence and Automation across the many different functions and markets we cover. This can only happen if we have the right data and work with data in a professional and modern way.

As a Grundfos data engineer you will work with the latest tools and apply your skills to realise the data strategy and need for data infrastructure in the product team you become part of. Each product team has a dedicated focus and portfolio of deliverables, but common for all is that infrastructure components and data modelling principles are guided by an enterprise view which expands the value of the data products you work with to other data consumers in Grundfos.

You will have several likable and very skilled peers you can discuss with and learn from. Maybe within your product team or maybe in the community of data engineers we have worldwide in Grundfos, and equally important you will have a management function which appreciates and understands the business of data.

“ This is your chance to become an important part of Grundfos’ amazing journey into a digital future as well as becoming part of a great team and an inspirational environment where competent colleagues will support and inspire you,” Thomas Asger Hansen explains.

Your Main Responsibilities


Develop and implement data pipeline infrastructure for at least one of our Product Teams.
Take part in the development of our core data platform, which is based on a modern and advanced stack.
Implement data governance as an integral part of the DevOps work you will perform.
Learn from – and participate in – the data engineering SMEG.


What we would like you to bring to the team


A likeable and inclusive personality.
A masters degree in computer science or other relevant field.
Knowledge of data modelling and data documentation.
Knowledge of data storage technology like NoSQL, SQL, Graph DB or like.
Knowledge of Continuous Integration, Continuous Development, and CI/CD pipelines is beneficial and valued.
Experience with Microsoft Azure, Snowflake data warehousing, C# and Python is an advantage.
Willingness to learn about - and adopt - new data management software and platforms.


“On a personal level, you have excellent interpersonal skills as you interact with colleagues and stakeholders on all levels. Thus, it is important that you have a positive, open and forthcoming personality, and we expect you to know how to coach and motivate others to do their best,” Thomas finishes. 

What’s in it for you?

Whether it’s developing leadership skills or advancing your expertise even further, we’ll support you with continuous learning and development opportunities, to help discuss and steer your long-term Grundfos career path. You’ll be welcomed from day one into an inclusive, trusting environment guided by six core values.

In addition, your day-to-day benefits include:


If you’ll be working from your home office, we’ll make sure you are well equipped with a good workstation. However, you are always welcome to our offices where you can engage, learn, and have fun with colleagues.
On top of it, flexible working hours and up to 3 days’ additional paid leave for volunteering of your choice.
Annual bonuses, health insurance, parental support, internal well-being consultants and programmes.
Access to the modern Grundfos Academy to pursue further both personal and professional development.
Diverse, inclusive environment with employee-led forums offering colleagues a safe place to connect and share openly.

Lead Data Engineer
Om stillingen

DI har en ambitiøs digital strategi, der skal bringe dem tættere på medlemmerne, understøtte vækst og sikre effektiv kommunikation og samarbejde på tværs. Som en del af dette og for at styrke Data & Automations Teamet søger DI en Lead Data Engineer.


Som Lead Data Engineer vil du være med til at opbygge en moderne dataplatform i DI. Du får mulighed for at være med i alle faser – fra analyse, design og udvikling til test, implementering og den måske vigtigste fase, forankringen i hverdagen. Du sætter den faglige retning ift. data engineering/dimensionel modellering, og viser at teori kan omsættes til praksis. Du kan skabe overblik på tværs, og ”tænker stort, men starter småt” med øje for, at få data ud at leve i forretningen ved at levere værdiskabende data og indsigter.

Afdelingen har ansvaret for dataprocessering og dataløsninger og er godt i gang med at opbygge en dataplatform på Microsoft Azure stacken – startende med et datavarehus og en række analytiske løsninger. Afdelingen har til ansvar at få teknologierne til at tale sammen ved at automatisere og strømline datapipelines.

Du får en nøglerolle, hvor du er med til at sætte retningen i afdelingen, som er Center of Excellence i forhold til dataplatformen. Du samarbejder tæt med forretningen om at levere værdiskabende data og indsigter gennem bl.a. selvbetjeningsløsninger. I den forbindelse vil du til dagligt være i tæt dialog med forretningen, hvor du også vil agere sparringspartner og indgå i dialog ift. opsætning af integration af data fra forskellige kildesystemer.

Derudover vil dit ansvarsområder bl.a være at:


Være drivende i at opbygge en moderne og mangfoldig dataplatform i DI.

Sætte den faglige retning ift. data engineering/dimensionel modellering, og viser at teori kan omsættes til praksis.

Skabe overblik på tværs, og ”tænker stort, men starter småt” med øje for, at få data ud at leve i forretningen ved at levere værdiskabende data og indsigter.

Du får en nøglerolle, hvor du er med til at sætte retningen i forhold til dataplatformen

Af arbejdsopgaver kan bl.a. nævnes:


Udarbejde tekniske løsningsforslag, såvel som at estimere opgaver og effektivt kommunikere det til forretningen

Designe, udvikle og implementere dataløsninger, primært til data warehouset

Designe, udvikle og vedligeholde dataplatformen og data pipelines

Bidrage til at udvikle en langsigtet strategi for dataplatformen

Integrere data fra en række kilder, og opbygning af datamodeller

Bidrage til tekniske og forretningsmæssige afklaringer af løsninger

Deltage i udviklings- og projektopgaver i forbindelse med optimering af processer og systemer på tværs af DI.

Om dig

Den ideelle kandidat brænder for data og udvikling og tør udfordre status quo og flirte med cloud teknologi og data arkitektur. Du har fire til otte års erfaring fra en lignende stilling, evt. fra et konsulenthus eller en brancheorganisation, hvor du har haft hands-on erfaring med opbygning af data løsninger. Du har en relevant akademisk baggrund formentlig fra CBS, KU eller ITU med særlig fokus på data. Du er serviceorienteret, hjælpsom og kan være bindeled mellem forretningen og it-specialister. Vi ser gerne at du er fagligt nysgerrig i forhold til nye tendenser og udviklingen inden for datavidenskab, herunder data services i Azure. Derudover arbejder du struktureret og selvstændigt med et analytisk mindset og en metodisk tilgang.

Vi ser gerne at du besidder følgende kvalifikationer:

Ekspert i ETL processen, SQL programmering og datamart modellering iflg. Kimball

Solid erfaring med agil udvikling, gerne med afsæt i Git platformen

Gode kommunikationsevner på både dansk og engelsk

Det er en fordel, men ikke et krav, hvis du også har erfaring med:


T-SQL og SQL Server automation rammeværk generelt set

Analytiske applikationer, gerne Microsoft Power BI

Microsoft Azure dataplatform (Infrastruktur)

Azure data factory

Derudover er du en person, der tager ansvar for at kvaliteten, af det der leveres, er høj. Du er god til at sætte dig ind i komplekse og fagligt tunge opgaver. Du er resultatorienteret og har stor handlekraft. Det er også vigtigt, at du er vedholdende, også når det kommer til at udvikle dig selv fagligt og personligt, da teamet har stort fokus på det gode kollegaskab, samt at være gode samarbejdspartnere for hele huset. Det er altså vigtigt, at du er i stand til at danne dig en helhedsforståelse af hele DI. Endelig er du en person som har både hjerte og hjerne med på job og er enig med teamet i, at et godt socialt arbejdsmiljø er en nødvendig del af det at gå på arbejde.

Er du god til at se muligheder, når du analyserer og strukturerer data til brugbare modeller? Og er du klar på at indtræde i en vigtig position som husets ekspert i business intelligence? Så er du måske den nye kollega hos Dansk Producentansvar.




Hos DPA træder du ind i en spændende og velfungerende organisation, som arbejder for et bedre miljø. Arbejdsmiljøet er uformelt og kendetegnet ved optimisme, gode ideer, hjælpsomhed og godt humør.




En udviklingsorienteret stilling med en bred berøringsflade

I stillingen som dataanalytiker får du mulighed for at forme jobbet, da du kommer til at arbejde med data i hele forretningen.




Dine primære opgaver er at:

Udtrække relevante data fra DPA’s registre til brug for rapportering, herunder være up-to-date med datamodeller
Kvalitetssikre og forklare data, så disse kan bruges til DPA-specifikke opgaver, f.eks. tildeling af genbrugsstation til producenterne
Analysere og tjekke dataudtræk op imod systemer på tværs af organisationen
Præsentere data og konklusioner til ledelsen
Udvikle procedurer og rapporter i Power BI, så de understøtter DPA’s forretning
Fungere som kontaktperson til BI-leverandører og go-to-person vedr. BI for medarbejdere
Deltage i diverse udviklingsprojekter




Du kommer til at kende detaljerne i datamodellerne, som danner grundlag for DPA’s egenudviklede registre og eksterne systemer, ligesom du vil blive leverandør af data til alle interne funktioner samt ekstern rapportering. Løbende har du mulighed for at sparre med afdelingens dataspecialist, og sammen sikrer I, at data fortsat håndteres og behandles korrekt i organisationen.




Hvad skal jeg kunne?

Vi er på udkig efter dig, der har en bred erfaring med BI-systemer, gerne Power BI, og du er dermed vant til at opstille rapporter og modeller til praktisk brug. Du har interesse i at arbejde med data på tværs af funktioner, ligesom du motiveres af at analysere og omsætte dataudtræk til forståeligt sprog for alle faggrupper. Generelt har du en god forståelse for IT, og du kan sætte dig ind i eksterne systemer, f.eks. Business Central, Algolia, TimePlan mv.




Du er kendetegnet ved at være proaktiv og analytisk med fokus på detaljen. Din arbejdsform er struktureret, og du sætter en ære i at overholde deadlines. Hvis du derudover skulle beskrive dig selv, fremhæver du din ”holdånd”, da du vægter det gode samarbejde højt. Det er derfor også vigtigt for dig at bidrage til den gode stemning på kontoret, hvor du og dine kollegaer prioriterer at komme fast i tidsrummet 9-15. Hos DPA værner man om det stærke fællesskab, og hjemmearbejde er derfor i begrænset omgang. Til gengæld er der ikke noget nævneværdigt overarbejde.




Hvor søger jeg jobbet?

I Moment varetager vi rekrutteringen af DPA’s nye dataanalytiker. Vi evaluerer løbende ansøgninger, og når rette kandidat er fundet, lukker vi stillingen ned.




Har du spørgsmål til stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte Recruitment & Search Specialist Kristian Hallas på tlf.: 32266710 eller mail: krh@moment.dk.




Om Dansk Producentansvar

Vil du være med til at formulere og drive vores datawarehouse-strategi i fællesskab med et stærkt team, og sikre at vi kan tage databaserede beslutninger på tværs af organisationen?







Data & Insights

Hej, jeg hedder Henri, og jeg er leder for afdelingen Data & Insights, hvor vi arbejder med data, for at skabe indsigt og drive strategiske beslutninger på tværs af Magasin. Vi er i en spændende transformation og søger en medarbejder, der sammen med resten af vores team vil tage ansvar for at definere og kommunikere tekniske krav for vores nye datawarehouse, og sikre at vi kan levere på vores globale strategi og de enkelte afdelingers behov.




Vi søger en ny kollega, der kan tage del i ejerskabet over vores datawarehouse-projekt, og drive udviklingen af vores BI-strategi sammen med teamet. Du vil arbejde sammen med et team bestående af BI Specialists, BI Developers, Web Analytics Specialists, Insights Specialists og AI Specialists. Målet er at skabe et team, der er fuldt fokuseret på at levere værdifuld indsigt og strategisk rådgivning ved hjælp af data.







Opgaver og ansvarsområder

Som Business Intelligence Specialist hos os vil du arbejde i spændingsfeltet mellem data og forretning.




Dine opgaver vil primært være:

Definere og kommunikere tekniske krav til udvikling og vedligeholdelse af vores nye datawarehouse i Microsoft SQL Server i samarbejde med teamet
Sikre dataeksponering til slutbrugere via QlikView og QlikSense
Forståelse og implementering af global strategi samt afdelingsspecifikke strategier
Udarbejdelse af KPI-rapporter og dashboards til forskellige forretningsenheder
Bidrage til data governance og kvalitetssikring af vores data
Samarbejde med kolleger på tværs af afdelinger for at identificere og løse datarelaterede udfordringer







Skal du være en del af teamet?

Vi søger en ny kollega med stærk erfaring inden for Business Intelligence, som ønsker at være med til at drive vores datawarehouse-projekt og skabe værdi gennem data. Jobbet kræver gode kompetencer inden for SQL og data modellering samt en stærk interesse for at forstå og støtte forretningsstrategier. Teknisk erfaring er et plus, men det vigtigste er evnen til at formulere og specificere tekniske krav for implementering af andre BI-specialister. Vores datawarehouse-udvikling er en teamopgave, og vi søger derfor en kollega, der trives med samarbejde og fælles ansvar. Vi ønsker hele tiden at forbedre os, og søger derfor også en kollega, som gerne vil udvikle sig og tage del i interne sparringssessioner.




Vi søger en BI Specialist med følgende egenskaber:

Erfaring med forskellige SQL-dialekter (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Snowflake SQL)
Kendskab til QlikView og QlikSense
Stærk forståelse af dimensionel modellering
Erfaring med data warehouse-udvikling er en fordel, men ikke et krav
Gode kommunikationsevner og interesse for at formidle analyser og indsigter
Evnen til at arbejde i en organisation med et stærkt kommercielt fokus
Interesse for at forstå både den overordnede strategi og de specifikke udfordringer i de forskellige afdelinger







Mig som leder

Jeg har en forventning om, at du vil sætte din faglighed i spil, og at du er bevidst om, at vi løfter i flok. Jeg vil altid være tilgængelig som sparringspartner, men jeg stoler på mine medarbejderes faglige kunnen, og i dagligdagen er det dit ansvar at sikre, at dine kolleger får maksimalt udbytte af de data og indsigter, du leverer.




Med Magasin som arbejdsplads får du en hverdag med højt til loftet, faglig sparring, gode udviklingsmuligheder og masser af energi. Jeg glæder mig til at få én mere med på holdet.




De bedste hilsner,

Henri Legentil-Borup,

Head of Data & Insights







Vil du søge jobbet?

Vi indkalder løbende til samtaler, og går du videre i processen, skal du igennem flere steps, hvor både du og vi vurderer, om denne stilling er det rigtige match for dig og Magasin. Hos os kan du blive inviteret til samtaler med både HR, leder og ansættende direktør i et forløb på 1-2 måneder. Som en del af processen bruger vi personprofiler, problemløsningstest og faglige cases, alt sammen for at sikre det optimale match for begge parter. Vi ser frem til i sidste ende at byde den helt rette kandidat velkommen i magiske Magasin.

ABOUT US

Scalepoint spirit in everyday life

Come as you are. That’s how we prefer it. You can easily leave dress codes, permanent lunch buddies, and corporate business attitudes at home. Our office is filled with kudos and high fives – and we believe that everyone is doing their best.




We have employees from 11 nationalities across our offices in Copenhagen, Poland and Switzerland. 63% of us ride a cycle to work. 42% eat vegetarian meals during lunch. 38% are parents. And 52% don't regularly work out. But our sport and events team tries to keep us moving by offering activities such as climbing, mountain biking, running and padel tennis. However, we cannot change the fact that we have a very generous attitude to sweets and cake. But that’s ok; there's a lot to celebrate at Scalepoint.




We look forward to hearing from you!

Our team in Copenhagen is responsible for the development and deployment of the company’s next-generation technology closely collaborating with the company’s other branches in New York and Berlin.

LiveIntent Copenhagen started as a Danish start-up company in 2013 and was acquired by LiveIntent in November 2015. The team is led by people who have been with us since the start in 2013 and consists of a further approx. 30 new hires that have been added since the end of 2016. We develop and operate a very complex analytical data processing pipeline which is a basic component of all the company's products.

About The Job

The Compute Infrastructure team empowers data scientists and data engineers through a Scala data warehouse framework designed for data modeling and the creation of type-safe and easily testable batch jobs. Our team also orchestrates a compute environment that simplifies the execution of Spark jobs, facilitating the analysis of terabytes of data with ease and cost-effectiveness. The runtime environment is based on Hadoop clusters on EC2 spot instances, dynamically scaling up as required, ensuring high resource utilization and stability

What you will be doing as part of the compute infrastructure team:


Operate and implement new features in the framework and the services managed by the team
Engaging with data scientist and identify ways of improving their experience and productivity of using our framework and services
Identify and implement computational improvements
Making improvements and/or fixing bugs by submitting patches to open source projects that are in our stack. For example Spark, Hadoop, Airflow and many others.

You are interested in back-end technologies and architecture and are passionate about learning new things. You may also be interested in math, statistics, or adtech technology.

You Have a Degree In Computer Science, Software Engineering, Physics, Math, Or Chemistry. You Have Practical Experience With Actual Programming, And Preferably Also Have a Practical And/or Deep Theoretical Understanding Of Some Of The Following


Spark and/or other large scale data-processing framework

You approach problems analytically and solutions pragmatically. You are full of good ideas, able to see opportunities and weaknesses in other people’s ideas, and able to find ways to discuss ideas in a distanced and constructive manner. You love to go in depth with different topics and are curious about learning about things within new subjects. You want to understand and get involved with the problems the company is facing. You thrive in a dynamic environment where work priorities can change, and therefore tasks may not always be finished. You can hand over tasks, but prefer to finish them yourself. You are able to work independently and enterprisingly. When people come to you with a problem, bug or a question you’ll want to help them immediately.

We believe in freedom and flexibility under responsibility so that office hours can be adapted to your life as long as meetings are covered. If you need to work from home one day, it is completely fine, as long as you live up to what is expected. We are an international company, with frequent contact between the departments in Berlin and New York City. The position is located in our office in Copenhagen.

Does that sound exciting? If so, send us an application! We are a small office with a social atmosphere so your personal profile is just as valuable to us as your technical skills. A cover letter will therefore be greatly appreciated.

Det er en fordel, hvis du har indsigt i områder som projektledelse, lager- & ressourcestyring, økonomi, produktion, m.m., og det er ligeledes en fordel, hvis du har erfaring med datakilder som Microsoft Dynamics 365 (CRM, AX), Nav, SAP eller andre kilder med økonomi, løn, tidsregistrerings- eller sags- og dokumentstyringsdata. Vi ser desuden gerne, at du mestrer Power BI og Tabular data modellering eller har interesse i at lære dette.

Vi forventer, at du har kendskab til og erfaring med størstedelen af følgende:

Teknologiske platforme


Microsoft SQL Server
Azure Data Platform
Azure Synapse og / eller Azure Data Factory
Microsoft Fabric
Tabular data modellering
Power BI
ETL / ELT
Formidling af tekniske emner til mindre tech-kyndige personer



Om dine personlige kompetencer

Vi ser gerne, at du:


er samarbejdsvillig, imødekommende, initiativrig
er god til at netværke både internt såvel som eksternt
ikke er bange for at gå forrest i opgaveløsningen
har fokus på at levere kvalitet og opfylde kundens forventninger indenfor budget
stiller høje krav til dig selv, og ikke er bange for at forvente det samme af dine omgivelser
er nysgerrig på andre teknologier og forretningsområder og hvordan en samlet Microsoft platform kan hjælpe med at skabe mere heltænkte løsninger.
Derudover er gode danskkundskaber en forudsætning for denne stilling.



Såfremt du har nogle spørgsmål til stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte Rekrutteringskonsulent Cecilie Olsen på +45 3028 9967 eller Manager, Jane Bøjer for en uforpligtende snak på hendes telefon +45 4130 4274

As part of its broader commitments to information transparency and facilitating the free flow of information, UNICEF published in 2020 the COVID-19 Vaccine Market Dashboard, the go-to public resource for the latest information on the world’s COVID-19 vaccine market and the COVAX Facility’s vaccine deliveries. It received +700,000 unique page views since its launch and was archived in December 2023.

SMC continued on its efforts to foster market information transparency in the health space, in particular immunization markets due to its volume. UNICEF is the largest procurer of vaccines worldwide – in 2023 alone, UNICEF procured $2.211 billion USD on vaccines/biologicals. In April 2024 UNICEF launched the Vaccine Markets Dashboard with the two-fold objectives of providing access to UNICEF’s vaccine deliveries information and a holistic market landscape for various vaccine markets. Although the Dashboard currently covers a limited number of vaccine markets, it is to expand and include more vaccine markets where UNICEF plays a key role in procurement and supply.

In this line, SMC is looking for a consultant to contribute to the expansion of vaccine products and vaccine prices sections in the Dashboard. S/he supports efforts in gathering market intelligence, more specifically on vaccine types, manufacturer, prices, development and approval status etc. and translating it into the dashboard.

Det forventes ikke, at du har tidligere kendskab til værktøjet, da du vil få en grundig introduktion til det gennem onboardingforløbet.

Din rolle bliver fx at:


bygge og vedligeholde ETL-processer i sin helhed ved brug af SQL og Informatica
udvikle og implementere standardiserede og automatiserede ingest-processer
udstille data i vores datawarehouse og datamarter, som er tilgængelig for vores brugere/kunder

Databaser og SQL
Datamodellering (Relationel og/eller dimensionel)
Formidling af teknisk information til samarbejdspartnere med andre fagligheder, samt omsætning af operationel viden



Det er desuden en fordel, hvis du har erfaring med eller kendskab til projektarbejde. Koncernsproget er dansk, så vi forventer, at du kan forstå og formulere dig på dansk – både skriftligt og mundtligt.

Et særligt arbejdsmiljø
Din leder i Data Warehouse stiller store krav til sig selv og sine medarbejdere, og har et højt ambitionsniveau på fagområdets vegne, men går ikke på kompromis med medarbejdernes trivsel. Du får en inkluderende leder, der går ind for åben og ærlig dialog. En leder, der giver ansvar, plads og medbestemmelse – fordi det skal være sjovt at gå på arbejde!

”Det er fedt at være Date Engineer i UFST, fordi der er utroligt mange muligheder for faglig udvikling, både igennem samarbejde på tværs af fagligheder, herunder BI-udviklere og data science udviklere, samt mulighed for at arbejde med klassisk ETL og udvikling af støtteværktøjer i eksempelvis Python.” Jakob, Data Engineer.

Kontakt og ansættelsesvilkår

Required Experience




GCP
Google Analytics
Looker Studio
Mixpanel




This role is for a company that specializes in software/app development for cooking. If you are a foodie and are active on social media, then you will have definitely seen them.




They have over 5 million followers, their own cookbooks, and global brand partnerships with high-street brands.




This isn't just your typical full-stack role, maintaining the backend and front end! Here you will actually make a difference!




What will you be doing, though?




Well, you'll be a Data Analyst focusing on direct-to-consumer data and Product Behavioural Analysis using all the latest tech in GCP. Also, you'll be trying all the latest recipes and food in the office! What's not to like?




The Tech Team said to me this ISN'T the role for someone who likes a highly structured and direct environment, where there is lots of Red Tape.




They said this role IS for someone who is proactive and looking to learn and be the best Data Analyst they can be whilst making the business better!




And if none of this makes you want to reach out to me or apply for the role, they have an on-site kitchen with high-end chefs that will cook you anything you want anytime you go on-site!




This role also offers paid training schemes, flexible working hours, an enhanced holiday package, a bonus, health insurance, and cooking lessons ;)

Analysing - Use your digital marketing and analytical skills to analyse competitor strategies to gain ranking insights and to help prioritise actions off the back of it

Effective communication, data storytelling, and relationship building skills. Capable of independently identifying stories in the data and presenting to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

Familiarity with the financial services industry, and a good understanding of key drivers in the price comparison market
