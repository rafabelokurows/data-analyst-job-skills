Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies‚Äîfrom the world‚Äôs largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups‚Äîuse Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone‚Äôs reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe‚Äôs most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We‚Äôre looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master‚Äôs degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office.

Job Summary

This individual is a member of the Vaccine Evaluation Center (VEC) whose primary role is to provide consultation to Investigators in the identification of data, and on data collection processes and study outcome on multiple studies as dictated by study protocols. The position coordinates the tasks performed by the data team and involves supervision of the data team. These studies have varying levels of complexities requiring an overall understanding of the data structures and programming.

Organizational Status

Exercises data management judgement (including non-routine) and is accountable for own directed actions. Makes judgements as to how the decision fits with acceptable Good Clinical Data Management Practices and what the impact of the decision will be. Reports to Senior Data Manager of the VEC.

Work Performed

Development of highly-specialized case report forms (CRFs) for each study. The project team consists of the investigator(s), field administrators, study coordinator, statistician and data coordinator who decide what information is required for a study and how it will be collected. Using this information, the data coordinator will formulate the CRF that will encompass all the needs of the study and maintain good clinical data management practise guidelines. The investigator(s) have final approval of the CRFs. Each study is faced with unique issues and the data coordinator must research and evaluate appropriate uses of data collection tools, usage of words in questions and style of questions. The data coordinator is continually evaluating the CRFs and accompanying user‚Äôs manual to ensure that the best possible tools are provided for the study.

The data coordinator is responsible for designing and implementing systems for organizing and managing the flow of data from the field through data management to analysis and to long term storage. This requires good organizational skills as there can be 15-20 different studies in progress and at different stages. In addition, data is received from many different sites across Canada in multi-centre clinical trials, which adds to the complexity of the job. This individual supervises the work of the data entry and data monitoring staff. This involves training and monitoring staff, reviewing workload assignments and adjusting schedules to reflect changes and priorities within the VEC.

The data coordinator manages the data throughout the course of each study ensuring that all work performed by study staff adheres to policies and standards. The data coordinator is responsible for maintenance of the database until study completion. Upon meeting all requirements for clean data, the database is given to the Statistician. Each study and sponsor have different needs making each study unique. The individual must be adaptable to the needs of each study to ensure good clinical data management practices are maintained.

Databases (both routine and complex) are custom designed and maintained by the data coordinator. This requires an in-depth working knowledge of software being used and keeping abreast of software changes as they occur. Maintaining and upgrading of the databases forms part of the duties.

Works in conjunction with the statistician to develop descriptive aggregate statistics for data cleanup and ensure that final statistical programme incorporates data management decisions during the study.

When necessary, provides basic statistical programming support as per pre-defined analysis plan.

The data coordinator is responsible for the long-term storage of VEC data that conforms to government set standards. The data coordinator needs to keep up with changes in the technology and acceptable practices.

Consequence of Error/Judgement

Errors in judgement can result in significant damage to the Vaccine Evaluation Center‚Äôs academic reputation as a centre of excellence, nationally and internationally. Poorly designed databases can result in higher study costs because of extra time spent dealing with data entry, data management and data analysis. Poorly designed databases can also result in making it difficult to perform effective data analysis affecting the overall science of the study. Ineffective training of data staff has budgetary and human resource implications. The systems to organize and manage the flow of data that are not appropriately designed can lead to financial problems as well as problems with conforming to good clinical data management guidelines.

Supervision Received

Receives general directions from project team leader(s) and the investigator(s) as part of the specified project team for study related issues. Study related work is reviewed by the Senior Data Manager.

Supervision Given

Supervises the data staff, a group that includes up to 8 research assistants and data monitoring staff. This includes assigning and monitoring the work, training staff and participating in job evaluation/performance measures. Works with the statistician to coordinate the flow and priority setting of the data and the analysis. Works with the field administrator(s) to ensure the efficient flow of data from the field to the data team and to coordinate workload of research assistant staff.

The successful candidate will have significant experience working with teams in complex and diverse environments, a deep understanding of Indigeneity and critical race theory, and is experienced in navigating difficult conversations relating to power, privilege, discrimination, conflict engagement, and equity and inclusion.

This role will support the work of the EIO, as the key individual responsible for analyzing, reporting, and supporting the collection of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) evidence and related data. The analyst will provide senior-level analytical support to executive officers, Deans, Directors, and the community. The analyst will provide equity, diversity, and inclusion analysis in support of planning, policy formulation, and decision-making activities. The analyst will plan, design, conduct, and implement major research projects and studies, interpret results, and make formal presentations. The core work of this position is the development of institutional data infrastructure (dashboards, data dictionaries, working groups, access protocols, etc.) needed to inform research, analysis, and evaluation across several strategic initiatives focused on EDI at UBC.

Organizational Status

The EDI Data Analyst position will work with two offices, the Equity & Inclusion Office (EIO) and the Planning and Institutional Research Office (PAIR). This position will report to the Manager, Data, Analysis, Reporting & Evaluation (DARE) at the EIO working in close coordination with the Associate Director(s), Student Experience, Evaluation and Research (SEER), and in PAIR. The day-to-day human resources will be supervised by the Manager, DARE, in the EIO. This position will work closely with data analysts in PAIR and Strategists in the EIO and will maintain connections with a broad spectrum of data stakeholders at UBC.
