Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

To us, every challenge, no matter how difficult, is an opportunity; to learn, to innovate, and to grow as one team. Status quo? Never. Courage? Always.
At TikTok, we create together and grow together. That's how we drive impact - for ourselves, our company, and the communities we serve.
Join us.

The USDS-Platform and Community Integrity (PaCI) team is missioned to: - Protect U.S. TikTok users, including and beyond content consumers, creators, and advertisers; - Secure platform health and community experience authenticity; - Build infrastructures, platforms, and technologies, as well as to collaborate with many cross-functional teams and stakeholders. The PaCI team works to minimize the damage of inauthentic behaviors on TikTok platforms, covering multiple classical and novel community and business risk areas such as account integrity, engagement authenticity, anti-spam, API abuse, growth fraud, live streaming security and financial safety, etc. In this team, you'll have a unique opportunity to have first-hand exposure to the strategy of the company in key security initiatives, especially in building scalable and robust, intelligent and privacy-safe, secure, and product-friendly systems and solutions. Our challenges are not some regular day-to-day technical puzzles -- You'll be part of a team that's developing novel solutions to first-seen challenges of a non-stop evolution of a phenomenal product eco-system. The work needs to be fast, transferrable, while still down to the ground to make quick and solid differences.

At Hiya we are on a mission to secure the voice call with trust, identity, and intelligence. We're protecting everyday people from spam and fraud calls, connecting businesses with their customers, and helping mobile carriers secure their networks for all. In early 2016, we brought Hiya Protect to market through Samsung Smart Call, AT&T Call Protect (now Active Armor) the first-ever network-based spam solution, and the Hiya consumer app for iOS & Android. Three years later in 2019, we brought Hiya Connect to market, a B2B branded call SaaS solution that enables companies to connect to the consumers they are trying to reach. The combination of Protect, Connect, and the Hiya app has resulted in the world's largest Voice Security Platform with over 450M users.

About the Position

The Senior Data Analyst is an individual contributor position responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to both improve and demonstrate the performance of Hiya's security and protection products. The Senior Data Analyst drives improvement both at the high level, with project management duties related to the flow and processing of data, but also at a low level creating high quality robust dashboards. As a Senior Data Analyst you will strive to become a subject matter expert in the products you are working on and potentially participate in customer meetings.

The ideal candidate will be comfortable with some project management duties related to data. This may include things like sourcing data, managing competitive tests, and collecting dashboard requirements from other teams.

This employee works with a team of product managers, solutions architects, scientists, engineers and other analysts whose mission is to provide the best system for identifying spam and fraud activity on telecom networks across the globe.

We're excited about you because you're the kind of person that thinks at a systems level. When you have a task before you, you seek to understand the conditions that led to it as you design your solution. You are organized and able to push to completion activities and involve not only your individual activities but also external data vendors and processors. You're a lifelong learner and a mentor, equally happy to learn from your colleagues as you are to share knowledge with them.

You have a special skill in using data in order to tell a story to others, either externally or within the company. You reach beyond the charts and numbers to understand the real implications of what you find. You're able to be guided by your analysis to find valuable new threads to pursue, either to get a more complete picture or to find unique perspectives in the research. And once fully pursued, you can use this knowledge to tell the story to others, building a simple and non-technical narrative to explain what you've found.

What You'll Do


Manage and maintain pipelines and processes of data within Hiya, from sourcing to ingestion to analysis
Regularly work with BD, Sales, and Marketing to help them find stories within our data that furthers their own objectives
Frequently work with the Data Science team to explore new theories about voice call traffic worldwide
Develop and maintain production-quality dashboards able to be used internally and externally as tools to assist others in their own analyses
Conduct various tests on service performance, and write documentation to summarize those results


Qualities that will make you successful:


Excellent communication skills and the ability to simplify complex concepts
Strong SQL analytical skills
Familiarity with python / R or equivalent for automation
Strong experience with BI platforms including Sigma, and Tableau
Familiarity with big data analytics systems like Databricks
Familiarity with workflow management systems like Airflow
Well-practiced ability to timebox your own work; you intuitively know which threads to pursue, and how far to pursue them in your research
Self-driven curiosity to understand the data (and the implications behind it)


The person in this role must embody Hiya's key values of Serving our customers, Doing rather than observing, Improving ourselves and our business, Owning and holding ourselves accountable for success, and Leading by showing up with a point of view, engaging in open discussion, listening respectfully to others opinions and committing to decisions.

You will have a fast start if you have experience:


Working in AWS Databricks workbooks and building dashboards
Developing advanced SQL queries including window functions
Optimizing queries for efficient performance in millions or even billions of records
Writing one-pagers and executive summaries based on your research


The requirements listed in the job descriptions are guidelines. You don't have to satisfy every requirement or meet every qualification listed. If your skills are transferable we would still love to hear from you.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. As our inaugural web analyst, you will play a pivotal role in boosting Notion's growth. You will identify opportunities on our website to enhance user sign-up conversion and improve the effectiveness of our SEO efforts. Collaborating closely with our marketing, data science, and engineering teams, you will help establish and define Notion's website metrics and targets. Your role will also include analyzing the performance of optimization experiments, creating monitoring dashboards for key pages, and shaping the process for measuring and analyzing Notion's website traffic data.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in data mining and data presentation, as well as your deep knowledge of website performance and SEO, to identify opportunities for improving Notion's website conversion and organic traffic beyond the numbers.
You will collaborate closely with our Web Optimization, SEO and Growth Product teams. Your role will involve making key recommendations about our website development priorities, understanding user behavior and navigation patterns, and establishing visitor segmentations and metrics.
You will influence your team's roadmap by sharing your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our investment in website optimization and SEO. (Insights are useful, but impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent 5+ years as a marketing analyst focused on instrumenting, understanding and analyzing website performance using a variety of tools.
You are fluent in event and cookie tracking methodologies, and can work directly with engineers to validate and debug tracking issues.
You bring a teacher’s mindset to working with stakeholders: you seek to develop a deep understanding yourself, and then use data and storytelling to teach your stakeholders about the drivers of business performance, as well as identify unique, actionable insights through independent study.
You have worked closely with CRO and SEO teams to optimize website performance at scale. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are an expert in SQL and have experience with Excel.
You relish turning ambiguous questions and problems into clear deliverables and insights.
You have built clean data visualizations and dashboards before using modern business intelligence tools (Tableau, Looker etc).
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
Mobile app tracking & analytics experience is a big plus.
You are a power user of either Google Analytics or Amplitude.
You are familiar with a scripting language for analytics, ideally Python or R.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have solid experience working with marketing teams to drive decision-making.

Department Description

The Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics (DEB), housed within the UCSF School of Medicine, is the largest department of epidemiology in the University of California system. The DEB is the epicentre of many of UCSF’s initiatives in population health, data science and informatics, health service research, health equity and artificial intelligence. The DEB has three missions: 1) education, 2) science, and 3) research. Its educational mission is to train students in epidemiologic and biostatistical methods for studying disease etiology and prevention, evaluating tests and treatments, and using evidence-based approaches in clinical practice and population health. The scientific mission of the DEB is to perform outstanding basic, clinical and population health research along a spectrum from molecules to society and to develop tools for the translation of knowledge that will improve clinical practice and population health and ensure optimal use of resources. The clinical mission of the Department is to support the practice of public health and preventive medicine in local, state, national and international health agencies.

Dr. Kim Rhoads serves as Associate Professor in the Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics as well as the senior leader (Associate Director) in the UCSF Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center (HDFCCC) for Community Engagement and the director of the Office of Community Engagement for the Cancer Center.

Umoja Health also hosts Youth Mobilizers and Summer Interns. The framework for community partnerships across all of these projects is centered in the Rhoads Equity in Action Lab (the REAL).

The HDFCCC Office of Community Engagement is charged with facilitating community based and community engaged research. Staff in the office support cancer center investigators in their efforts to build community advisory boards to guide research strategy. The office also hosts the nearly two decade old community advisory board (CAB) including regular quarterly meetings, public cancer information offerings and steering committee activities. The mission of the OCE is to SUPPORT community engagement across the catchment area with agencies and cancer advocates; to FACILITATE equitable community academic PARTNERSHIPS for research and cancer education; and to DISSEMINATE relevant cancer information to communities and new interventions for cancer prevention and control to providers taking care of the underserved across the Greater Bay Area. OCE vision is the elimination of cancer inequities that lead to cancer disparities in Northern California.

The Role

Our generative AI-powered products are revolutionizing the practice of medicine, and we’re looking for a highly motivated Data Analyst to join our growing US-based data Engineering team. In this crucial role, you will leverage data to drive business intelligence and strategic decision-making, primarily working with SQL, Python, and DBT.

What You'll Do


Data Analytics: Collect, clean and analyze data to extract meaningful insights and identify trends and patterns relevant to our business and product.
Visualization & Reporting: Develop and maintain dashboards to effectively communicate trends and patterns to internal and external stakeholders
Collaboration: Work closely with multidisciplinary teams such as product, engineering and customer success to identify data gaps and acquire data sources that enhance our understanding of the business and product.
Domain Expertise: Serve as the domain expert for business contexts of our analytic data, understanding the assumptions and limitations of different business metrics.
Issue Resolution: Investigate and correct issues identified through data operations monitors, tools and reports


What You'll Bring

Expert-level SQL skills with proficiency in writing efficient queries on large and complex data sets.
Understanding of database technology and experience with a cloud SQL data warehouse (e.g. BigQuery, Postgres, Snowflake)
Experience in analytical data modeling and schema design
Experience with a data visualization tool (e.g. Tableau, Looker, Sigma)
Experiences with SQL orchestration in DBT
Excellent communicator capable of effectively delivering quantitative findings to non-technical stakeholders in a clear and compelling fashion.
A team player, comfortable assisting others across the organization in solving data problems and answering questions with data

Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The mission of the People Analytics team is to improve Stripe’s performance by collecting data, measuring critical constructs, and generating insights that help Stripe attract, develop, and retain our most important asset - our Stripes.

As a team, we’re a group of individuals with diverse backgrounds across consulting, HR, and other data-focused domains who are curious, passionate, and obsessed with using science and data to deliver high-value precise outputs to our users.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and present comprehensive analysis to influence and enable decision-making
Collaborate seamlessly with cross functional partner teams, internal stakeholders, and business leaders
Contribute valuable insights to our People Organization to improve our evolving processes and programs
Design, build and enable the delivery of analytics products through our BI, visualization, and analytics platforms including Tableau, Visier and Saratoga
Identify, build, validate, enable and upkeep people metrics
Conduct ad hoc analyses received through intake requests from partner teams
Partner with data engineering to identify and execute improvements against our existing workforce data ecosystem



Who you are

We’re looking for an analytics leader who will help us in our ongoing journey to build a world class People Analytics team and improve the overall employee experience and productivity of our Stripes. You are someone who is curious, has an eye towards craftsmanship and enjoys working in a fast-paced environment. Through your work, you will likely need to partner closely with our People Research & Insights team, People Partners, People Org teams, and Business teams to identify opportunities for greatest impact - then deliver value through creative problem-solving, actionable insights, and effective people practices. Examples of projects this individual may lead include evaluating interview effectiveness, collaborating with Finance to forecast hiring costs and volumes in new geographies, and developing dashboards focused on opportunities to improve return to office.

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience working in management consulting or analytics (people analytics experience is a plus)
Strong data visualization skills - must be able to create clean visuals that highlight key findings and tell a compelling story
Experience communicating technical concepts clearly, with all audiences
Experience with multiple data analysis and visualization tools (Tableau and Visier preferred); experience with a scripting language (Python or R) is a plus
Experience with human capital benchmarking and target setting
Flexible and comfortable with ambiguity (our environment changes rapidly, and your work might too!).
Knowledge of data architecture, design, development, and QA/QC processes
Ability to manage competing priorities and timelines to deliver high-quality solutions, as-promised and on-time



Preferred Qualifications


A bias toward automation and efficiency, with the know-how to cleanly structure data to enable continuous delivery of insights
A desire to promote self-service capabilities for stakeholders
You have operated across the full lifecycle of analytics projects - requirements gathering, data collection, data cleansing, analysis, visualization, QA/QC, and deployment
You have a bias towards action and an ability to iterate towards an end state
Stay up to date on best practices, scientific findings, and case studies in the world of people analytics and measurement
You can bring structure to ambiguity



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $130,900 - $196,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

As Notion continues to grow rapidly, we're seeking talented data engineers to join our team and help us build foundational datasets and pipelines, as well as the infrastructure that supports them. Your work will accelerate the decision-making process of key product and business functions. If you're passionate about analytics use cases, data models, and solving complex data problems, then this is the team for you!

What You'll Achieve


You'll define the processes and ETL infrastructure to transform and make data readily available across the company
You'll build core datasets to serve as unique sources of truth for product and business functions (product, marketing, sales, finance, customer experience, data science, business operations, IT, engineering)
You'll partner with data scientists and other internal stakeholders to understand their needs and then design, build and monitor pipelines that meet today's requirements but can gracefully scale with our growing data size
You'll implement automated workflows that lower manual/operational cost for stakeholders, define and uphold SLAs for timely delivery of data, move the company closer to democratizing data and a self-serve model (query exploration, dashboards, data catalog, data discovery)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You are a self-starter and continuously gather and synthesize high-impact needs from business partners, designing and implementing the appropriate technical solutions, and effectively communicating about deliverables, timelines and tradeoffs
You've spent 4+ years as a data engineer building core datasets and supporting business verticals as needed. You are passionate about analytics use cases, data models and solving complex data problems
You have hands-on experience shipping scalable data solutions in the cloud (e.g AWS, GCP, Azure), across multiple data stores (e.g Snowflake, Redshift, Hive, SQL/NoSQL, columnar storage formats) and methodologies (e.g dimensional modeling, data marts, star/snowflake schemas)
You are a SQL expert. You intimately understand aggregation functions, window functions, UDFs, self-joins, partitioning and clustering approaches to run correct and highly-performant queries
You are highly comfortable with object-oriented programming paradigms (e.g Python, Java, Scala)



Nice To Haves


You’ve worked at a fast-growing company, a SaaS company or are eager to contribute in such an environment (being a current Notion user would also be great!)
You have hands-on experience in designing and building highly scalable and reliable data pipelines using BigData stack (e.g Airflow, DBT, Spark, Hive, Parquet/ORC, Protobuf/Thrift, etc)



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $170,000 - $235,000 per year.

Who Are We?

In 1955, two Georgia neighbors opened up a restaurant that would change the world. That first restaurant led to the Waffle House brand you see today. As the business expanded throughout Georgia and the Southeast, the “Yellow Sign” soon became a familiar landmark, signifying America’s Place to Eat™ and America’s Place to Work™. Today, the Waffle House system has more than 1,900 locations in 25 states, reaching as far north as Pennsylvania and as far west as Arizona. All open 24-hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Our workforce can be broken into two categories – Operations (Restaurant Associates and Managers) and Support Team (Corporate Office Associates, Field Recruiters, and Maintenance Technicians).




We are a strong, growing company dedicated to our Customers and Associates. We would love to have you on our team! To learn more about the Waffle House culture and our great community of employees and customers, please visit www.wafflehouse.com!
