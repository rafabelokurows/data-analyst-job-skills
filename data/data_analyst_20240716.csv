We're making Africa the first cashless continent.

In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.

We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.

Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in.....

How you'll help us achieve it

We’re looking for an expert in statistical analysis focused on Experimentation and Causal Inference to join the Growth team at Wave. In this role, you will design, run, and analyze experiments in collaboration with product and operations teams to improve the product and customer experience. The aim is to apply rigorous statistical methods of causal inference and machine learning to grow our user base and optimize product features.

In this role you will

Be embedded closely with our operations and product teams.
Generate insights using customer, merchant and agent data, which will include running power analyses, statistical modeling, and data visualization.
Design, implement and analyze experiments to evaluate the causal impact of new product features, promos, and operational process changes.
Design causal inference analysis plans using longitudinal data.
Explore large data sets to identify growth drivers and generate testable hypotheses.
Build and apply machine learning models to improve product features and to analyze heterogeneous treatment effects (e.g. using random forests and related methods).
Take ownership of the analytics process - from project scoping and design through communicating findings to stakeholders.

Key Details

You can work remotely from anywhere (between UTC -5 and +2) with reliable internet access.
You’re willing to travel to one of our key markets once per year for ~6 days (Wave covers all costs). We also provide a yearly stipend of $800 to meet with coworkers.
Our salaries are competitive and are calculated using a transparent formula. For this role, depending on your level, we offer a salary of up to $134,400 USD (paid in your local currency equivalent), plus a generous equity package.

          <p>Our mission</p><p>We're making Africa the first cashless continent.</p><p>In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.</p><p>We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.</p><p>Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in.....</p><p>How you'll help us achieve it</p><p>We’re looking for an expert in statistical analysis focused on Experimentation and Causal Inference to join the Growth team at Wave.

Unsere Produkte stehen für Nachhaltigkeit, denn sie sind vegan und wurden ohne Tierversuche entwickelt.

We stand up for individuality. We actively foster an inclusive workplace where diversity and individual difference are valued and leveraged to achieve the agency’s vision. And most importantly we value every individual’s wellbeing.

As a diversity champion, equal opportunities and disability confident employer and an ardent advocate of flexible working we understand that everyone has unique requirements and needs.

We are a global creative agency, but the individual really is at the heart of everything we do. We use data to find out what makes them tick. We use technology to talk to them one-to-one – but to one million at a time. And we use creativity to encourage them to engage, click, buy and bond, again and again.

Each brand is unique and has its own individual challenges. We pride ourselves in rising to each and every one of them, for brands such as KFC, Mercedes Benz, IKEA, Paypal and Virgin Media 02.

Us

In order to foster collaboration and relationships, our hybrid model requires three office days per week. As equal opportunities proponents, we are open to discuss any hybrid working related needs during the initial screening.

Learning and Development is important. We all know that. Its why we have a dedicated Learning and Development team and offer regular career conversations and bespoke L&D programmes so that you can leave us with more than when you started.

We recognise that the work of diversity, equity and inclusion calls on all of us. That’s why we set up The Neighbourhood. A collective of people, at different stages of the DE&I journey, whether impacted or allies, dedicated to helping our colleagues take ownership and effect change across 4 key pillars; Anti-racism, Disability, Gender & LGBTQ+ and Parents & Carers.

The Health and Wellbeing of our people matters immensely. We offer Coaching opportunities for all through our partnerships with Sanctus (mental health partner who provides online coaching; you can talk about anything, personal or professional) and Sayge (1:1 professional development coaching program). We have 40 trained Mental Health First Aiders across the agency and have Babylon Health (Private GP service) for all.

You’re better at work when you feel better in yourself. So, in addition to your annual holiday, you can take a “Me” day and an “Us” day, every year. Your “Me” day is for you to invest in yourself – go after a life goal, meditate, learn to paint, bake cakes or just have a duvet day watching Netflix!

Your “Us” day is all about giving back and helping others – volunteer, pick litter at a local park, hang out with the elderly or raise money for a local charity.

We’re progressive and always open to new initiatives, for example we’ve recently partnered with Fertifa (Leading Fertility and Reproductive Health benefit providers). Because we know the journey to becoming a family isn’t always easy (that includes men too), and we support our people through that journey whether you are new parent, experiencing the menopause, or anything else in between.

Whatever stage of life you are at, we make sure you have the tools you need to have a healthy work life balance.

In the Data Analytics team you will ensure both the voice of the customer and CFO are represented in the room with hard evidence. As well as supporting exceptional customer experiences using data, you will help ensure every action we take is directly improving performance against your clients objectives.

As an Analyst, you will work under supervision to deliver projects within set deadlines, utilising your strong hands on analytical capabilities. Your strengths in Python and SQL will ensure you can efficiently deliver robust analytics with guidance from your team.

Your experience with web and social analytics tools (GA / Adobe / Brandwatch / Sprinklr) and data visualisation tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker / etc) will enable you to uncover key insights across channels and create self-service dashboards.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

So, in addition to your annual holiday, you can take a “Me” day and an “Us” day, every year. Your “Me” day is for you to invest in yourself – go after a life goal, meditate, learn to paint, bake cakes or just have a duvet day watching Netflix!<br><br>Your “Us” day is all about giving back and helping others – volunteer, pick litter at a local park, hang out with the elderly or raise money for a local charity.<br><br>We’re progressive and always open to new initiatives, for example we’ve recently partnered with Fertifa (Leading Fertility and Reproductive Health benefit providers).

We are focused on orthopaedic surgery and our mission is to improve the lives of people living with joint pain. Our technology connects the global orthopaedic community and we work with patients, surgeons, universities and leading life science companies. Through shared learning, we can accelerate research and develop smart tools to advance patient outcomes.




Our work has been featured in the Sunday Times and BBC News, and our exciting research into AI and robotics has been featured in the BBC Click and can be viewed here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/technology-53348680/apps-help-orthopaedic-patients-prepare-for-surgery. We launched in 2016 and have a rapidly-growing customer base across the UK, Europe, US and Australia, working with prestigious healthcare clients (including global medical device companies, state-wide US hospital networks, the NHS and large government institutions). We are now part of HOPCo, a successful and rapidly-growing US healthcare enterprise.




Our outwardly-visible products are a native mobile app for patients, and a configurable web app for clinicians and healthcare executives (and soon also for patients). But there’s a lot more going on under the bonnet - our platform is focused on capturing, processing and reporting data. We have developed smart infrastructure allowing us to do this globally whilst remaining compliant with regional healthcare regulation. We also have an R&D team focused on Computer Vision / Machine Learning, where we hold several patents and have presented at prestigious medical conferences.




We are now seeking a Data Analyst (Statistics) to take responsibility for our data analysis and data reporting functions, and to work proactively to develop, monitor and improve our key metrics. As a company that creates innovative data points and products, you will be at the forefront of the value creation process. Your tools will be SQL, Jupyter, Python data libraries, augmented by statistical modelling and ML techniques where necessary. You will work initially within the Engineering team, and then likely transition to part of the Product or Customer Success teams.




We are building something big together. We like to roll our sleeves up, whilst at the same time nurturing your individual goals and ambitions. We are looking for problem-solvers who are committed and analytical, keen to learn while always being delivery minded, self-starters for whom everything is possible but the best solution is always the most appropriate one. Above all we want to hire high-energy people that we’ll love working with every day. 




What we need:

Good understanding of SQL and ability to understand a large schema
Good understanding of data analytics and analysis using statistical methods
Ability to interact with stakeholders at all levels of the business




What we want you to do:

Fulfil the business need for internal KPI reporting: performing ad-hoc querying if necessary, but primarily enabling self-service reporting by providing common dashboards
Following stakeholder requirements, perform detailed analysis using data analytics and statistics: for example, analysing intraoperative robotic data alongside patient demographic data
Work with data engineers to specify new data requirements (e.g. to improve data quality)
Improve documented data definitions, to improve consistency and understanding across the business
Help our clinical research partners to perform novel analysis and publish new papers




Salary: Very competitive, depending on experience.




Benefits:

25 days' holiday 
Pension contributions, matching up to 5% of full earnings
Private Health Insurance
Annual training budget 
Cycle to work scheme
Flexible hybrid working, and home-working set-up allowance
Free eye tests and contribution towards glasses
Enhanced maternity & paternity leave 
Company socials
A dog-friendly office!




Our office is based in Central London. We are working primarily remotely, but you will be required to work in the office at least weekly (usually Wednesday). You can work at the office on any additional days. We are unlikely to consider candidates who are more than 2 hours from London.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE CAN ONLY PURSUE AN INTERVIEW PROCESS WITH APPLICANTS ALREADY RESIDENT IN THE UK. IF YOU ARE NOT RESIDENT IN THE UK PLEASE DO NOT APPLY, AS WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROCESS YOUR APPLICATION.

We started Marshmallow when we found out how unfair insurance prices are for people who move to the UK. All because the industry hasn’t given this huge cohort of people a second’s thought, and isn’t set up to price them properly.

We saw an opportunity to do things differently, so we made it our mission to back the ones who step outside the norm. Since we started, we’ve helped 100,000s of people get a fairer deal on their car insurance. Using technology, we serve people that are often overlooked by financial services companies, solving important problems for people who need it most.

We know there are millions of marginalised customers out there. And we know that they face unique problems that most companies aren’t even aware of. We believe that our future is helping these people by learning about their experiences, and building our company around their needs. And there are strong signs that there’s a need for a company like us. Earlier this year we hit profitability, which is a huge milestone, but the most exciting thing is that we’re only just getting started.

How We Work

We’re really proud of the culture we’ve created. We push for progress every day, because we know that we’ll only hit big milestones by taking lots of smaller steps. We’re always open to helping our team mates, sharing our ideas, experience and knowledge to solve problems together. We take risks, think creatively and experiment relentlessly to meet our customer’s needs, and never pass blame when things go wrong. We encourage people at all levels to take ownership of their work, and to be bold in challenging how we do things. Everyone has a voice and the opportunity to make an impact.

And autonomy and ownership are only possible with clear direction. That’s why we collaborate to do in-depth planning twice a year, and make sure we leave with clear goals and objectives that flow from top to bottom. To make sure we’re as aligned as possible across functions, most of our work rolls up into four tribes; Acquisition, Retention, Claims and Pricing, Underwriting & Fraud. Each tribe has multiple teams embedded in it, working cross-functionally to do great work.

We’re so excited for all of the challenges up ahead, and we need more people to help us tackle them! If life at Marshmallow sounds like it could be for you, explore our culture handbook or read our blog to find out more.

Location: London - Hybrid

Department: Technology

Reporting to: Data Director




This is a full-time position based at the Time Out London office, with 2 days in the office and 3 work from home days, offering flexibility.




Role Overview

We're looking for a data analyst who is as passionate about uncovering hidden trends in the data as they are about unearthing the next hidden gem in the city.




Time Out is renowned as the global media powerhouse for all things cultural – the ultimate guide to eating, drinking, exploring, and everything in between.In addition to helping you find the best a city can offer, we are also a growing premium food hall business that brings the best of the city’s food scene under one roof that is Time Out Market.




As a unique business that straddles two seemingly different worlds (media and hospitality), our data and insight demands are bespoke. You will be fundamental to building our data-driven approach, culture and capabilities.




The perfect candidate does not exist, if you think you have experience in most of these capabilities then please consider applying.




What you'll be doing:

Dive deep into our user data from Google Analytics to understand what Time Out audiences are craving most.
Unleash your inner data ninja using BigQuery on GCP to analyse website traffic, app engagement, and user behaviour.
Dig into and uncover patterns from our Markets data to inform what are our top sellers, current food trends and how we can incorporate that in our menus
Craft beautiful and insightful Looker dashboards that tell compelling stories about our content and audience.
Collaborate with our editorial and marketing teams to translate data insights into actionable strategies.
Stay on top of the latest data analysis trends and tools to ensure we're constantly optimising our content and user experience.




What you'll bring to the party:

A minimum of 2 years' experience as a data analyst (or similar role).
An arsenal of data analysis skills, including SQL, Looker, and Google Analytics.
BigQuery on GCP – the more experience, the better (but we can train the right candidate!).
A sharp eye for detail and a talent for wrangling messy data.
An inherent curiosity with the ability to translate complex insights into actionable recommendations
A genuine love for Time Out's mission and a passion for exploring everything your city has to offer.




Bonus points if you have:

Python development experience
Experience working in the media or entertainment industry.
A knack for data visualisation and storytelling with a Time Out twist (think witty, engaging, and full of personality).
A positive attitude, collaborative spirit, and a willingness to learn and grow

At Time Out Group we believe in diversity and equal opportunity for all people. We do not discriminate against external or internal candidates on the basis of age; disability; gender, gender reassignment; race; religion or belief; sexual orientation; marriage and civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity.

We believe that everyone has the right to express themselves as they are as this enriches us all. We believe in an open world, social justice, and the pursuit of happiness, after all, we are in the happiness business.

An arsenal of data analysis skills, including SQL, Looker, and Google Analytics.

BigQuery on GCP – the more experience, the better (but we can train the right candidate!).

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$147,900 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$147,900 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Awesome. Something led you here, maybe a glimpse of potential and something amazing? Well that’s how we feel about Klue.

Who are we?

Klue is a VC backed, capital-efficient high growth SaaS company. Tiger Global and Salesforce Ventures led our US$62m Series B in the fall of 2021. We’re creating the category of competitive enablement: helping companies understand their market and outmaneuver their competition. We benefit from having an experienced leadership team working alongside several hundred risk-taking builders who elevate every day.

We’re one of Canada’s Most Admired Corporate Cultures by Waterstone HC, a Deloitte Technology Fast 50 & Fast 500 winner, and recipient of both the Startup of the Year and Tech Culture of the Year awards at the Technology Impact Awards.

We’re growing and currently looking to add a Data Analyst Intern to our team.

This internship will span several functions of the Insights department and will give you a broad view of what it takes to run an innovative SaaS company. Klue is a very collaborative company where we believe in the value that can be unlocked by sharing data insights across departments and clients - you'll be getting a full picture of how a SaaS company on a rocketship trajectory operates. You’ll have many opportunities to listen in on strategic conversations and will be encouraged to ask questions along the way. As the company grows, we will have many roles to fill within the Insights department and would hope the right candidate would consider returning one day.

As a data analyst intern, you will be focused on helping our insights team ensure our data providers and outsourced content creators are delivering accurate data to their end-users.

The Data team's scope covers data validation for existing sources, outsourced content, and new potential data sources. As the data marketplace is always evolving, you will also be involved in broader projects across the team.

This is You:


Highly analytical and critical thinker
Ability to digest and communicate complex data
You like ambiguity and thrive in fast-paced environments
You have experience with Excel and/or Python
You like to learn new things and are keen to become an expert


Bonus points for...


Experience with analytics platforms, data cleaning initiatives, data gathering.


What you'll be measured on:


Ability to identify trends in data sets and develop unique solutions.
Efficiency in data gathering and data cleaning.


How We Work


Hybrid. Best of both worlds (remote & in-office)
Our main Canadian hubs are in Vancouver and Toronto, and most of our teams are located in EST and PST.
You and your team will be in office at least 2 days per week.


⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️

Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity and encourages creative solutions to problems. All new engineers deploy working code their first week, and we strive to broaden individual impact with support from managers, mentors, and teams. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment.

Are you strongly driven by a passion for data analysis, complex problem-solving, and designing business intelligence solutions? As a Business Intelligence Analyst at Yelp, you’ll work with partners and stakeholders across the company — including our Executive Leadership, Finance, BizOps, Product, Data Science, Data Engineering, Marketing, and People teams — to provide relevant data and visualization for key business decisions.

Yelp's Business Intelligence team is dedicated to empowering Yelp's leadership and analytics teams with trusted and reusable data visualizations, data warehousing products, and BI platform support. The work of our team continuously evolves with the company’s needs and is critical to Yelp’s data-driven decision making. We are looking for someone adept at engaging with business partners, who understands their needs, and who is passionate about diving into data, unraveling complexities, and designing business intelligence solutions.

This opportunity is fully remote and does not require you to be located in any particular area in Canada. We welcome applicants from throughout Canada. We’d love to have you apply, even if you don’t feel you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Yelp, we’re looking for great people, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.

What You'll Do


Build relationships with key business partners, lead requirement gathering sessions, analyze source data and systems, and provide feedback on detailed data analysis to guide data-driven decision making.
Become a subject matter expert on Yelp data and share knowledge with Engineering, Product, and other teams to refine business understanding, and identify areas of needed business improvement.
Plan and execute business intelligence/analytics projects by collaborating with business partners, data engineering, and data visualization teams.
Contribute to data strategy for data warehousing, reporting, dashboards, and self-service analytics.
Exercise advanced knowledge of SQL to extract critical information and business value from data spread across multiple databases and data formats.
Provide training and ongoing support to business users on business intelligence products.


What It Takes To Succeed


Ideally 3 years of experience in business intelligence or as a business systems analyst, data analyst/developer or similar role.
Experience with data visualization tools (Tableau preferred).
Experience documenting business and technical requirements and directly interacting with engineers on business intelligence projects.
Excellent collaboration, communication, negotiation, and presentation skills.
Working knowledge of statistics and KPIs (LTV, Churn, etc.).
Advanced SQL skills and experience writing complex queries.
Knowledge and working experience with dimensional data modeling.


What You'll Get


Compensation range is $82,000-230,000 annually. Depending on your role and level, you may also be offered a bonus, restricted stock units, and benefits.
This opportunity has the option to be fully remote in all locations across Canada.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$147,900 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our Capital One DA Team.

Data is at the center of everything we do. It started in 1988, when we launched as a startup with the goal of using data to deliver personalized credit card products. Fast-forward a few years — we’re a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Data Analyst on our team, you’ll be curious enough to ask questions and brave enough to blurt out a cool idea. You approach problems with creativity, and you love exploring new ways of doing things. But most importantly, you enjoy collaborating, and you’re always willing to share your knowledge with your peers — because you know that’s how the best ideas are made.

Working with us

How do we do things at Capital One Canada? We listen — to our people, and to our customers. We change with the times and have adopted a flexible hybrid model. A flexible hybrid working model is one that creates the opportunity to match the work that we do to the environment that best supports that work. Associates working in the hybrid model are expected to come into the office 3 days a week across Tuesdays and Thursdays, reserving Mondays and Fridays as company-wide virtual days. As was true before the pandemic, expectations of being in the office will be balanced with personal life flexibility.

At Capital One we’re committed to diversity, inclusion and belonging . We strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and inclusive behaviours are embedded in everything we do to positively impact associates. Strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and to help challenge the status quo and create the best outcomes for everyone.

We’re focused on helping associates live well—physically, financially and emotionally. When you join us, we support you and those who are most important to you, offering full coverage for spouses, domestic partners, and dependents. We’ve designed our benefits program to be flexible, comprehensive and consistent across our organization. From health and fitness center discounts, to training and professional development programs—and much more—you’ll discover that Capital One is committed to helping you live your best life.

Here are some examples of projects that you may work on as a Senior Data Analyst:


Build, automate, and maintain critical business reporting using cutting-edge tools.
Write SQL to clean, transform, investigate, and augment large, complex database tables
Work closely with business partners to make sure our business strategy is as data driven as possible
Design and implement rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas to customers or company leaders
Ensure data and intent integrity by automating data quality verification
Support and consult with the business to propagate data management best practices
Create and maintain well-managed critical data processes to meet regulatory requirements.
Identify process improvements and deliver on them.
Perform ad hoc analytics on large/diverse datasets.


We want you to be one of us if you are:


Curious: You ask why, you explore, and you’re not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You know SQL and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.
A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database or an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, QuickSight, Tableau, etc.).
Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.
Collaborative: You’re able to work with teammates with diverse skill sets and explain your work to less technical audiences.


Basic Qualifications:


Bachelor's Degree
At least 2 years of experience with SQL
At least 1 year of experience with Unix or equivalent
At least 1 year of experience with version control systems like GitHub.


Preferred Qualifications:


Master's Degree

At least 3 years’ experience with SQL

About the Team

The Data Insights Group at Bench comprises two teams: Data Analytics and Analytics Engineering. This group is a centralized function responsible for delivering data products, providing decision-making support and insights, and maintaining analytics pipelines and data warehousing for all of Bench. The Data Analytics team works closely with business leaders and Strategy & Operations managers to develop instrumentation for core metrics and leverage findings to generate strategies to grow the business.

What you'll be getting up to:


Being a deeply trusted partner, leader and advisor to business teams
Having a strong understanding of our business metrics and how they relate to our business teams, while providing an informed opinion in strategic decision making
Ensuring that the definitions of metrics are consistent across our current and new reporting
Creating business cases and roadmaps in partnership with stakeholders and project managers that improve the state of the data ecosystem
Building and maintaining sources of truth that support ""self-serve"" analytics
Transforming data through SQL queries to blend meaningful insights from various data sources and data warehouses
Delivering ad-hoc analysis, recommendations and insights that stakeholders can action
Identifying, tackling and reconciling reporting issues in a timely manner
Highlighting opportunities to accelerate our business performance and strategy
Identifying opportunities to upstream teams to improve data and systems architecture
Assessing gaps in existing metrics layers and providing feedback to analytics engineering and system teams to develop solutions upstream

3+ years of experience in accounting, finance, consulting, strategy, business intelligence or a related field
Degree in Business, Economics, Engineering, or other quantitative fields
Experience translating complex business problems into clear drivers and structured models
Excellent skills in BI tools like Tableau, SQL, Google Sheets, etc.
Exceptional analytical skills and intuition
Comfort working with quantitative and qualitative data
Experience communicating recommendations effectively to senior leadership
Ability to adapt to shifting priorities with high resilience and strong problem-solving skills


You're a great fit if you have:


A nose for value: You can take a big-picture perspective to identify and stay focused on what's most important
Appreciation for systems: You can connect the dots and figure out the best solution for Bench, not just the stakeholders you're working with
Intellectual curiosity: It's not enough for you to know the what - you want to know the why. You are energized by challenging problems, and are persistent/ resourceful in your efforts to solve them
Startup hustle: You are highly motivated, proactive, comfortable with change and ambiguity. You have a humble, team-player attitude and are ready to pitch in wherever you are needed most


What you'll get:


At Bench we share information freely and openly whenever possible. The salary range for this role is $73,200 - $91,500 per year, depending on experience.
In addition, we offer an extended benefits package that includes paid vacation, paid flex days, stock options, and full health, dental, and vision.
You'll get access to Inkblot Therapy's Employee and Family Assistance Program (EAP) that offers counseling and support, for you and family members, as well as professional development coaching, financial advice, legal advice and much more.
Bench has a number of Affinity Groups - groups of people who have shared identities and experiences! The purpose of these groups is to support underrepresented Benchmates and amplify their voices.
If you live in BC's Lower Mainland, you have the opportunity to work at home and in our downtown office location, depending on your preference! For some roles, we do require folks to be in the office regularly. We'll be sure to outline expectations during the interview process.
For folks working fully remote, we will provide additional solutions to bring teams together for collaboration and connection.
Whether you get to use the office or if you work remotely, you'll have access to our Home Office Setup Fund to ensure that you have everything you need to work comfortably from home, from day one.
You'll have the opportunity to work from somewhere other than your home province for up to 3 months, within a 12 month period.


Everyone has their own unique talents. Even if you don't meet 100% of the qualifications outlined above, tell us why you'd be a great fit for this role in your application.

We believe that unchecked biases disproportionately impact the most marginalized people in society—including but not limited to BIPOC, LGBTQ2S+ people, immigrants, and people with disabilities. We strongly encourage applications from people with these identities or other marginalized communities because we believe that without you, we are all less. If you are selected for an interview and require support during the process, including disability accommodation, we'll give you the opportunity to tell us when we contact you.

The Equity & Inclusion Office is committed to ensuring that UBC is a community in which human rights are respected and equity, diversity, and inclusion are integral to university life. Through its leadership, vision, and collaborative action, the Equity & Inclusion Office (EIO) will further UBC's commitment to excellence, equity, and mutual respect.

The successful candidate will have significant experience working with teams in complex and diverse environments, a deep understanding of Indigeneity and critical race theory, and is experienced in navigating difficult conversations relating to power, privilege, discrimination, conflict engagement, and equity and inclusion.

This role will support the work of the EIO, as the key individual responsible for analyzing, reporting, and supporting the collection of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) evidence and related data. The analyst will provide senior-level analytical support to executive officers, Deans, Directors, and the community. The analyst will provide equity, diversity, and inclusion analysis in support of planning, policy formulation, and decision-making activities. The analyst will plan, design, conduct, and implement major research projects and studies, interpret results, and make formal presentations. The core work of this position is the development of institutional data infrastructure (dashboards, data dictionaries, working groups, access protocols, etc.) needed to inform research, analysis, and evaluation across several strategic initiatives focused on EDI at UBC.

Organizational Status

The EDI Data Analyst position will work with two offices, the Equity & Inclusion Office (EIO) and the Planning and Institutional Research Office (PAIR). This position will report to the Manager, Data, Analysis, Reporting & Evaluation (DARE) at the EIO working in close coordination with the Associate Director(s), Student Experience, Evaluation and Research (SEER), and in PAIR. The day-to-day human resources will be supervised by the Manager, DARE, in the EIO. This position will work closely with data analysts in PAIR and Strategists in the EIO and will maintain connections with a broad spectrum of data stakeholders at UBC.

The incumbent is expected to interact with other office staff in the EIO and PAIR, with staff from other departments, senior academic officers including Vice-Presidents, Deans, Directors, Department Heads, Senate Committees, representatives of other universities, government bodies and representatives, and other higher education and university-related organizations.

Work Performed


Provide timely, accurate, and meaningful EDI information for use by senior administrative and academic officers and committees in the formulation of programs and the resolution of issues related to equity, diversity, and inclusion throughout the University.
Plan, design, develop, and implement analytic reports, and statistical information in areas such as employment equity, student experience and demographics, and equitable survey design.
Coordinate, conduct, organize, and analyze data, and prepare reports for university stakeholders.
Extract and synthesize data from a variety of university databases to produce statistical reports, and participate in the revision of databases or the design of new databases.
Provide advice and assistance to project team members and colleagues.
Consult with university units, including departments, faculties, and administrative units, with respect to their information requirements.
Take ownership of projects, plan timely resolutions, delegate and supervise project tasks, validate results, and communicate the results to stakeholders; to identify appropriate quality standards and ensure that processes are in place such that these are met.
Translate policy issues and/or problem areas into meaningful research studies or reports which appropriately illuminate these issues and provide guidance for decision-making.
Manage survey research projects, identify areas of concern, design questionnaires, determine samples, monitor returns, and report results to ensure acceptable scientific standards are used in the design of the survey and in sample selection and use descriptive and inferential statistics as appropriate to analyze results.
Communicate the results of complex EDI data analysis, whether by statistical summary, the visual display of quantitative information, tabular output, or written description.
Provide data, reports, and analyses in order to provide support on fiscal and budgetary matters.
Respond to ad hoc requests for information and undertake special analytical projects as necessary.
Assist with the development of the necessary information systems to support management needs for resource allocation information.
Prepare draft reports and analyses for submission to government agencies.


Consequence of Error/Judgement

The position requires accurate knowledge of a wide range of university policies and procedures. Data and analyses produced by the incumbent are used in formulating policy, making decisions relating to the future of the university, evaluating the effectiveness of EIO programs and policies, and in mandatory reporting. Errors in the design or analysis of research could have far-reaching consequences. The position must make responsible recommendations in dealing with policy issues and must be vigilant that the data produced are accurate. Errors in judgment could not only diminish the effectiveness of UBC in its leading role in the education and development of British Columbians, Canadians, and International Students but could result in considerable financial loss and the reduced stature and reputation of the university and its senior executives.

Supervision Received

The position is expected to operate largely at his/her own discretion within broad parameters set by the Manager, Data, Analysis, and Reporting & Evaluation. The position is expected to show considerable initiative in developing appropriate research methodologies and in ensuring that their analyses are timely, accurate, and comparable.

Through its leadership, vision, and collaborative action, the Equity & Inclusion Office (EIO) will further UBC's commitment to excellence, equity, and mutual respect.

The successful candidate will have significant experience working with teams in complex and diverse environments, a deep understanding of Indigeneity and critical race theory, and is experienced in navigating difficult conversations relating to power, privilege, discrimination, conflict engagement, and equity and inclusion.

This role will support the work of the EIO, as the key individual responsible for analyzing, reporting, and supporting the collection of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) evidence and related data. The analyst will provide senior-level analytical support to executive officers, Deans, Directors, and the community. The analyst will provide equity, diversity, and inclusion analysis in support of planning, policy formulation, and decision-making activities. The analyst will plan, design, conduct, and implement major research projects and studies, interpret results, and make formal presentations. The core work of this position is the development of institutional data infrastructure (dashboards, data dictionaries, working groups, access protocols, etc.) needed to inform research, analysis, and evaluation across several strategic initiatives focused on EDI at UBC.

Organizational Status

The EDI Data Analyst position will work with two offices, the Equity & Inclusion Office (EIO) and the Planning and Institutional Research Office (PAIR).

Job Summary

This individual is a member of the Vaccine Evaluation Center (VEC) whose primary role is to provide consultation to Investigators in the identification of data, and on data collection processes and study outcome on multiple studies as dictated by study protocols. The position coordinates the tasks performed by the data team and involves supervision of the data team. These studies have varying levels of complexities requiring an overall understanding of the data structures and programming.

Organizational Status

Exercises data management judgement (including non-routine) and is accountable for own directed actions. Makes judgements as to how the decision fits with acceptable Good Clinical Data Management Practices and what the impact of the decision will be. Reports to Senior Data Manager of the VEC.

Work Performed

Development of highly-specialized case report forms (CRFs) for each study. The project team consists of the investigator(s), field administrators, study coordinator, statistician and data coordinator who decide what information is required for a study and how it will be collected. Using this information, the data coordinator will formulate the CRF that will encompass all the needs of the study and maintain good clinical data management practise guidelines. The investigator(s) have final approval of the CRFs. Each study is faced with unique issues and the data coordinator must research and evaluate appropriate uses of data collection tools, usage of words in questions and style of questions. The data coordinator is continually evaluating the CRFs and accompanying user’s manual to ensure that the best possible tools are provided for the study.

The data coordinator is responsible for designing and implementing systems for organizing and managing the flow of data from the field through data management to analysis and to long term storage. This requires good organizational skills as there can be 15-20 different studies in progress and at different stages. In addition, data is received from many different sites across Canada in multi-centre clinical trials, which adds to the complexity of the job. This individual supervises the work of the data entry and data monitoring staff. This involves training and monitoring staff, reviewing workload assignments and adjusting schedules to reflect changes and priorities within the VEC.

The data coordinator manages the data throughout the course of each study ensuring that all work performed by study staff adheres to policies and standards. The data coordinator is responsible for maintenance of the database until study completion. Upon meeting all requirements for clean data, the database is given to the Statistician. Each study and sponsor have different needs making each study unique. The individual must be adaptable to the needs of each study to ensure good clinical data management practices are maintained.

Databases (both routine and complex) are custom designed and maintained by the data coordinator. This requires an in-depth working knowledge of software being used and keeping abreast of software changes as they occur. Maintaining and upgrading of the databases forms part of the duties.

Works in conjunction with the statistician to develop descriptive aggregate statistics for data cleanup and ensure that final statistical programme incorporates data management decisions during the study.

When necessary, provides basic statistical programming support as per pre-defined analysis plan.

The data coordinator is responsible for the long-term storage of VEC data that conforms to government set standards. The data coordinator needs to keep up with changes in the technology and acceptable practices.

Consequence of Error/Judgement

Errors in judgement can result in significant damage to the Vaccine Evaluation Center’s academic reputation as a centre of excellence, nationally and internationally. Poorly designed databases can result in higher study costs because of extra time spent dealing with data entry, data management and data analysis. Poorly designed databases can also result in making it difficult to perform effective data analysis affecting the overall science of the study. Ineffective training of data staff has budgetary and human resource implications. The systems to organize and manage the flow of data that are not appropriately designed can lead to financial problems as well as problems with conforming to good clinical data management guidelines.

Supervision Received

Receives general directions from project team leader(s) and the investigator(s) as part of the specified project team for study related issues. Study related work is reviewed by the Senior Data Manager.

Supervision Given

Supervises the data staff, a group that includes up to 8 research assistants and data monitoring staff. This includes assigning and monitoring the work, training staff and participating in job evaluation/performance measures. Works with the statistician to coordinate the flow and priority setting of the data and the analysis. Works with the field administrator(s) to ensure the efficient flow of data from the field to the data team and to coordinate workload of research assistant staff.
