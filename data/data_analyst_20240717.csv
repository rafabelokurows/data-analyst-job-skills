Kickstart your career in Efficio’s new Lisbon office!

Efficio are currently looking for Data Analysts to join their growing Digital Delivery team. Whether you are a fresh graduate who is wanting to start a career in Digital or somebody who has already had some experience in data analysis, this will be an exciting opportunity for you! As part of Efficio’s Digital business, the data teams deliver a range of standard and bespoke technology products to our clients to complement our market-leading eFlow platform and procurement consulting services.

People deserve more from their money. More visibility, more control, more freedom. And since 2015, Revolut has been on a mission to deliver just that. With an arsenal of awesome products that span spending, saving, travel, transfers, investing, exchanging and more, we've helped 45+ million customers get more from their money. And we're not done yet.

About The Role

We approach Data Science at Revolut the same way that we approach everything else. We take complex problems, and create extraordinary solutions that our customers love.

We’re looking for a superstar Data Analyst who does not believe there is a data task that can be too hard 🦬 From digging into our complex databases, looking for the root cause of a problem to designing their own solutions and writing their own code to implement them. In this process they never stop learning, picking up new skills and delivering value.

#MuchMoreThanJustAJob

Early morning. Campo 24 de Agosto. In 4 minutes, you are clocking in at the office. Start your day having breakfast with the Team and grab fresh fruit on the way to your seat, in one of Porto’s most typical neighborhoods. This Purple Day is going to be a busy one: daily meeting ensuring all team members are on the same page regarding work status, priorities and blockers, language class and, just after, a Talent Management meeting with your manager, discussing your career path.

Lunch break. Today, your Team is onboarding newcomers, but also welcoming French colleagues: the perfect excuse to walk downtown and bond over a francesinha. When returning, inhale nature and peace of mind in Natixis Urban Garden (look at the crops; ready to harvest!).

Back inside. Brainstorming session on a new, exciting project in our disruptive and immersive Manaus Village. The afternoon went flying (tasks, meetings, some jokes with your teammates). End it on a high note: celebrating cultural diversity with a Diwali, the Indian festival of lights.

Tomorrow, you attend a conference led by influential speakers in your industry and, the day after, you will work from home, benefitting from some focus time to complete that report and soft skills course on LinkedIn Learning. Once you are done with your work for the day, strike the right note playing with Natixis band or be part of a board games session. If that is too steady for you, meet your colleagues to catch some waves or sail the Douro river during golden hour.

Once you are done with your work for the day, strike the right note playing with Natixis band or be part of a board games session. If that is too steady for you, meet your colleagues to catch some waves or sail the Douro river during golden hour.
