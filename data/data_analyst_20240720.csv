Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

The teams within USDS that deliver on this commitment daily span across Trust & Safety, Security & Privacy, Engineering, User & Product Ops, Corporate Functions and more.

Why Join Us
Creation is the core of TikTok's purpose. Our platform is built to help imaginations thrive. This is doubly true of the teams that make TikTok possible.

Analyze business, product and security data, uncover evolving attack motion, identify weaknesses and opportunities in risk defense solutions, explore new space from the discoveries.
Quantify risk control effects and trends, collaborate with engineering, modeling, operational and product colleagues, contribute to risk measurement, perception, mitigation and prevention with data stories.

Our platform connects people from across the globe and so does our workplace. At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. To achieve that goal, we are committed to celebrating our diverse voices and to creating an environment that reflects the many communities we reach. We are passionate about this and hope you are too.

PLEASE APPLY DIRECTLY TO THIS ROLE VIA: https://boards.greenhouse.io/recidiviz/jobs/4384432006

Recidiviz is thrilled to be hiring a Senior Data Analyst to join our team! We're a small, fast-moving group that works with complex criminal justice data from our state partners and develops analyses that target the drivers of incarceration in specific systems. That's where you come in. We're looking for people who have an attention to detail to provide rigor to our analysis, creativity and inquisitiveness to identify and solve open-ended problems, clarity to think through complex and variable data, flexibility to adjust in a rapidly evolving environment, and above all else, a collaborative, kind nature to add to our culture.

About Us

Recidiviz is creating safer, healthier communities by improving outcomes for people in the criminal justice system. We build technology to reduce the number of people in prison and to help criminal justice leaders embrace data-driven decision-making.

Using software tools and thoughtful product design, we've been able to safely and permanently reduce incarceration and improve outcomes. We work side-by-side with leaders of the criminal justice system, people in prison and on supervision, and ecosystem partners to build a better path forward. In addition to the revenue we earn from state partners, some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations support our work.

People who succeed at Recidiviz lead with kindness and humility, assume good intent, learn from failure, and fix problems when they see them. They are excited to work arm in arm with government leadership and staff to improve outcomes. They are great listeners. They build deep relationships with and empathy for the people we work with and the people who our mission serves, even when those two groups feel at odds.

About The Role

This role collaborates across several teams to guide work that targets the drivers of incarceration. Our Data Analysts work with diverse data – criminal justice data both raw and processed from across the country, reports and policy documents from government agencies, and much more – to develop our understanding of the criminal justice system and to motivate change. They perform analyses, contribute to tooling that improve our data and how we work with it, and help drive product launches by ensuring each product in each state has the analytical data required to drive the impact we seek. Our Data Analysts also play a key role in contextualizing and presenting their analyses to key stakeholders, both internal and external. Travel is encouraged approximately once a quarter, and occasionally required.

Contextualizing and communicating key findings to internal and external stakeholders
Collaborating with our State Engagement and Implementation Engineering teams to design and execute on targeted roadmaps that drive impact in the states where we work
Collaborating with our Product Management, Data Science, and Software Engineering teams to bring analyses and data modeling into production software
Analyzing trends and changes in areas related to our own work to understand how our products function


Wild success


A year from now:
You've driven impact. Your work has led to several launches of our products across the country and has helped quantify the impact those tools are having on the outcomes of the justice system.
You've leveled up our analytical team. Your contributions to our tooling and processes, as well as your support for your teammates, has helped set our team up to achieve more impact sooner.

Minimum Qualifications


Strong communication and collaboration skills, to help nurture a knowledgeable, data-oriented culture
Enthusiasm for working with internal and external partners from diverse backgrounds and worldviews, such as government staff, researchers, journalists, technical staff, and practitioners in criminal justice reform
Experience working in a cross-functional organization that designs, builds, and launches products for users
Experience with project management, technical leadership, or other forms of team leadership
Ability to inspect source data, reason about data models, examine results closely, and prepare data and analyses that are usable for various applications
5 or more years (full-time) of practical experience exploring, analyzing, and processing complex datasets
Professional work experience using SQL to work with large datasets, including high proficiency writing efficient queries for more complex data extraction and transformation tasks
Professional work experience and high proficiency using Python, specifically the Pandas library, for tasks such as statistical analysis and data visualization


Preferred Qualifications


Experience working with large datasets from the public sector, especially related to criminal justice
Familiarity with our data stack, which includes Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery, Looker, Jupyter notebooks, and Python/Pandas

More about Recidiviz

Recidiviz was an all-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we've built an A-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator's 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.

Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) over 15 state partners – big and small, red and blue – and covers more than 40% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners – from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.

To learn more about how we do what we do, check out our 2023 Year in Review, read some press coverage, or watch our TED Talk. And if you're really keen to see our work, you can dive into our Github :).

An important note

Lasting change is always built on diversity. Recidiviz recruits, employs, trains, compensates and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, veteran status, ancestry, citizenship, marital status, gender identity and all protected status as required by applicable law. We consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you have a special need that requires accommodation, please let us know in your application. Even if you don't think you meet all the criteria above, drop your resume, and we'll take a look – you might be great for another role or another time!

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The mission of the People Analytics team is to improve Stripe’s performance by collecting data, measuring critical constructs, and generating insights that help Stripe attract, develop, and retain our most important asset - our Stripes.

As a team, we’re a group of individuals with diverse backgrounds across consulting, HR, and other data-focused domains who are curious, passionate, and obsessed with using science and data to deliver high-value precise outputs to our users.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and present comprehensive analysis to influence and enable decision-making
Collaborate seamlessly with cross functional partner teams, internal stakeholders, and business leaders
Contribute valuable insights to our People Organization to improve our evolving processes and programs
Design, build and enable the delivery of analytics products through our BI, visualization, and analytics platforms including Tableau, Visier and Saratoga
Identify, build, validate, enable and upkeep people metrics
Conduct ad hoc analyses received through intake requests from partner teams
Partner with data engineering to identify and execute improvements against our existing workforce data ecosystem



Who you are

We’re looking for an analytics leader who will help us in our ongoing journey to build a world class People Analytics team and improve the overall employee experience and productivity of our Stripes. You are someone who is curious, has an eye towards craftsmanship and enjoys working in a fast-paced environment. Through your work, you will likely need to partner closely with our People Research & Insights team, People Partners, People Org teams, and Business teams to identify opportunities for greatest impact - then deliver value through creative problem-solving, actionable insights, and effective people practices. Examples of projects this individual may lead include evaluating interview effectiveness, collaborating with Finance to forecast hiring costs and volumes in new geographies, and developing dashboards focused on opportunities to improve return to office.

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience working in management consulting or analytics (people analytics experience is a plus)
Strong data visualization skills - must be able to create clean visuals that highlight key findings and tell a compelling story
Experience communicating technical concepts clearly, with all audiences
Experience with multiple data analysis and visualization tools (Tableau and Visier preferred); experience with a scripting language (Python or R) is a plus
Experience with human capital benchmarking and target setting
Flexible and comfortable with ambiguity (our environment changes rapidly, and your work might too!).
Knowledge of data architecture, design, development, and QA/QC processes
Ability to manage competing priorities and timelines to deliver high-quality solutions, as-promised and on-time



Preferred Qualifications


A bias toward automation and efficiency, with the know-how to cleanly structure data to enable continuous delivery of insights
A desire to promote self-service capabilities for stakeholders
You have operated across the full lifecycle of analytics projects - requirements gathering, data collection, data cleansing, analysis, visualization, QA/QC, and deployment
You have a bias towards action and an ability to iterate towards an end state
Stay up to date on best practices, scientific findings, and case studies in the world of people analytics and measurement
You can bring structure to ambiguity



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $130,900 - $196,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team.

Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article. Please exercise caution and cease communications if something feels suspicious about your interactions.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

As Notion continues to grow rapidly, we're seeking talented data engineers to join our team and help us build foundational datasets and pipelines, as well as the infrastructure that supports them. Your work will accelerate the decision-making process of key product and business functions. If you're passionate about analytics use cases, data models, and solving complex data problems, then this is the team for you!

What You'll Achieve


You'll define the processes and ETL infrastructure to transform and make data readily available across the company
You'll build core datasets to serve as unique sources of truth for product and business functions (product, marketing, sales, finance, customer experience, data science, business operations, IT, engineering)
You'll partner with data scientists and other internal stakeholders to understand their needs and then design, build and monitor pipelines that meet today's requirements but can gracefully scale with our growing data size
You'll implement automated workflows that lower manual/operational cost for stakeholders, define and uphold SLAs for timely delivery of data, move the company closer to democratizing data and a self-serve model (query exploration, dashboards, data catalog, data discovery)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You are a self-starter and continuously gather and synthesize high-impact needs from business partners, designing and implementing the appropriate technical solutions, and effectively communicating about deliverables, timelines and tradeoffs
You've spent 4+ years as a data engineer building core datasets and supporting business verticals as needed. You are passionate about analytics use cases, data models and solving complex data problems
You have hands-on experience shipping scalable data solutions in the cloud (e.g AWS, GCP, Azure), across multiple data stores (e.g Snowflake, Redshift, Hive, SQL/NoSQL, columnar storage formats) and methodologies (e.g dimensional modeling, data marts, star/snowflake schemas)
You are a SQL expert. You intimately understand aggregation functions, window functions, UDFs, self-joins, partitioning and clustering approaches to run correct and highly-performant queries
You are highly comfortable with object-oriented programming paradigms (e.g Python, Java, Scala)



Nice To Haves


You’ve worked at a fast-growing company, a SaaS company or are eager to contribute in such an environment (being a current Notion user would also be great!)
You have hands-on experience in designing and building highly scalable and reliable data pipelines using BigData stack (e.g Airflow, DBT, Spark, Hive, Parquet/ORC, Protobuf/Thrift, etc)



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $170,000 - $235,000 per year.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture.

You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

Role Type: Full-time

Compensation: $120,000

Visa sponsorship: Not available

Hires remotely in: United States

Experience: 5+ years (full-time experience)

PLEASE APPLY DIRECTLY TO THIS ROLE VIA: https://boards.greenhouse.io/recidiviz/jobs/4384432006

Recidiviz is thrilled to be hiring a Senior Data Analyst to join our team! We're a small, fast-moving group that works with complex criminal justice data from our state partners and develops analyses that target the drivers of incarceration in specific systems. That's where you come in. We're looking for people who have an attention to detail to provide rigor to our analysis, creativity and inquisitiveness to identify and solve open-ended problems, clarity to think through complex and variable data, flexibility to adjust in a rapidly evolving environment, and above all else, a collaborative, kind nature to add to our culture.

About Us

Recidiviz is creating safer, healthier communities by improving outcomes for people in the criminal justice system. We build technology to reduce the number of people in prison and to help criminal justice leaders embrace data-driven decision-making.

Using software tools and thoughtful product design, we've been able to safely and permanently reduce incarceration and improve outcomes. We work side-by-side with leaders of the criminal justice system, people in prison and on supervision, and ecosystem partners to build a better path forward. In addition to the revenue we earn from state partners, some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations support our work.

People who succeed at Recidiviz lead with kindness and humility, assume good intent, learn from failure, and fix problems when they see them. They are excited to work arm in arm with government leadership and staff to improve outcomes. They are great listeners. They build deep relationships with and empathy for the people we work with and the people who our mission serves, even when those two groups feel at odds.

About The Role

This role collaborates across several teams to guide work that targets the drivers of incarceration. Our Data Analysts work with diverse data – criminal justice data both raw and processed from across the country, reports and policy documents from government agencies, and much more – to develop our understanding of the criminal justice system and to motivate change. They perform analyses, contribute to tooling that improve our data and how we work with it, and help drive product launches by ensuring each product in each state has the analytical data required to drive the impact we seek.

More about Recidiviz

Recidiviz was an all-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we've built an A-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator's 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.

Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) over 15 state partners – big and small, red and blue – and covers more than 40% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners – from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.

To learn more about how we do what we do, check out our 2023 Year in Review, read some press coverage, or watch our TED Talk. And if you're really keen to see our work, you can dive into our Github :).

An important note

Lasting change is always built on diversity. Recidiviz recruits, employs, trains, compensates and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, veteran status, ancestry, citizenship, marital status, gender identity and all protected status as required by applicable law. We consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you have a special need that requires accommodation, please let us know in your application. Even if you don't think you meet all the criteria above, drop your resume, and we'll take a look – you might be great for another role or another time!

Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.

Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations.

As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.

We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense.

The Role

Our generative AI-powered products are revolutionizing the practice of medicine, and we’re looking for a highly motivated Data Analyst to join our growing US-based data Engineering team. In this crucial role, you will leverage data to drive business intelligence and strategic decision-making, primarily working with SQL, Python, and DBT.

What You'll Do


Data Analytics: Collect, clean and analyze data to extract meaningful insights and identify trends and patterns relevant to our business and product.
Visualization & Reporting: Develop and maintain dashboards to effectively communicate trends and patterns to internal and external stakeholders
Collaboration: Work closely with multidisciplinary teams such as product, engineering and customer success to identify data gaps and acquire data sources that enhance our understanding of the business and product.
Domain Expertise: Serve as the domain expert for business contexts of our analytic data, understanding the assumptions and limitations of different business metrics.
Issue Resolution: Investigate and correct issues identified through data operations monitors, tools and reports


What You'll Bring


5+ years of experience in Data Analytics, BI or a related field, ideally at a product-focused software company.
Expert-level SQL skills with proficiency in writing efficient queries on large and complex data sets.
Understanding of database technology and experience with a cloud SQL data warehouse (e.g. BigQuery, Postgres, Snowflake)
Experience in analytical data modeling and schema design
Experience with a data visualization tool (e.g. Tableau, Looker, Sigma)
Experiences with SQL orchestration in DBT
Excellent communicator capable of effectively delivering quantitative findings to non-technical stakeholders in a clear and compelling fashion.
A team player, comfortable assisting others across the organization in solving data problems and answering questions with data
Passionate about data quality, with a keen interest in data drill down and problem-solving
Ability to prioritize amid changing priorities in a fast moving environment


We value people who want to learn new things, and we know that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.

Must be willing to work from our SF or NYC office 2-3x/week

We are actively seeking candidates based in or willing to relocate to the San Francisco Bay Area and/or the New York Tri-State area. This position requires a commitment to a hybrid work model, with the expectation of coming into the office 2-3 times per week.

Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article.

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Our mission is simple: Make our cities better places to live through carsharing.

Carsharing empowers people to move in a smarter and more sustainable way: studies show that one shared car replaces between 4 and 10 privately owned cars, which frees up space in our cities while giving communities 24/7 access to cars when they need them.

With our connected car technology, users can quickly and easily book and unlock a wide variety of vehicles directly from our app, without ever having to meet anyone in person, carry an access card, wait in line, or coordinate picking up keys.

To reach our vision of a world where all cars are shared, we need a strong team to help us disrupt car ownership. We look for people who are curious, positive, and engaged; who can adapt and learn quickly; who have the skills and smarts to reach their goals autonomously, while having the generosity and mindset to work collaboratively.

Topics of interest to the lab include inverse problems, digital twins, modeling cardiovascular hemodynamics, reinforcement learning for decision support in the intensive care unit, automated electrocardiogram analysis, predicting catastrophic clinical events such as cardiac arrests, and learning novel patient representations from their data. We have a particular interest in critical care medicine, where the stakes are highest, patient complexity is the greatest, and the amount of data far outstrips any clinician’s ability to process it. Applicants will be jointly supervised by Dr. Aguirre and Dr. Houstis of the Cardiovascular Research Center (CVRC).

The starting point for any project will entail assembling a deep data record of patient signals using a database we have assembled, one rare in its scope and size. The experience of working with such a rich data source from a nationally recognized institution such as Massachusetts General Hospital should prove invaluable for the applicant’s future career aspirations. For analysis we expect the applicant to take advantage of the wealth of state-of-the-art computational tools currently available, tools such as scientific machine learning, deep learning, denoising diffusion, differentiable programming, or neurosymbolic artificial intelligence. There is a tremendous and as yet untapped opportunity to extract synergy from data, analytics, and a practitioner’s knowledge of clinical medicine. We aim to help the candidate realize this potential to impact patient care.

A candidate’s experience in the lab could lead in a number of future directions, including academia, medical school, or the healthcare industry. Past lab members have successfully pursued all of these directions. Our collective experience straddles all of these environments and we expect to provide mentorship in all aspects of career development. The lab is a fun, friendly, and collaborative environment that values work-life balance. We are located in the MGH Cardiovascular Research Center and are active members of the greater Boston science community including MIT and Harvard.

Requirements

Qualified candidates should have:


A Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics, or biology. Expectations and mentorship will be tailored to the applicant’s training.
Mature coding skills: Python, Julia, or R (Python and/or Julia are preferred).
Proficiency with Machine Learning and/or System Modeling, including libraries such as PyTorch or Flux.
Knowledge of cardiovascular medicine is a plus but not required.
Ability to work independently and collaboratively.
Growth Mindset.


Interested candidates should include a resume or CV as well as a brief cover letter describing their background and interests in their application.

EEO Statement

Massachusetts General Hospital is an Equal Opportunity Employer.By embracing diverse skills, perspectives and ideas, we choose to lead. Applications from protected veterans and individuals with disabilities are strongly encouraged.

          We are seeking a computational scientist to address a range of questions in cardiovascular medicine. Topics of interest to the lab include inverse problems, digital twins, modeling cardiovascular hemodynamics, reinforcement learning for decision support in the intensive care unit, automated electrocardiogram analysis, predicting catastrophic clinical events such as cardiac arrests, and learning novel patient representations from their data. We have a particular interest in critical care medicine, where the stakes are highest, patient complexity is the greatest, and the amount of data far outstrips any clinician’s ability to process it. Applicants will be jointly supervised by Dr. Aguirre and Dr. Houstis of the Cardiovascular Research Center (CVRC).<br><br>The starting point for any project will entail assembling a deep data record of patient signals using a database we have assembled, one rare in its scope and size. The experience of working with such a rich data source from a nationally recognized institution such as Massachusetts General Hospital should prove invaluable for the applicant’s future career aspirations. For analysis we expect the applicant to take advantage of the wealth of state-of-the-art computational tools currently available, tools such as scientific machine learning, deep learning, denoising diffusion, differentiable programming, or neurosymbolic artificial intelligence. There is a tremendous and as yet untapped opportunity to extract synergy from data, analytics, and a practitioner’s knowledge of clinical medicine. We aim to help the candidate realize this potential to impact patient care.<br><br>A candidate’s experience in the lab could lead in a number of future directions, including academia, medical school, or the healthcare industry. Past lab members have successfully pursued all of these directions. Our collective experience straddles all of these environments and we expect to provide mentorship in all aspects of career development. The lab is a fun, friendly, and collaborative environment that values work-life balance. We are located in the MGH Cardiovascular Research Center and are active members of the greater Boston science community including MIT and Harvard.<br><br><strong>Requirements<br><br></strong>Qualified candidates should have:<br><br><ul><li>A Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics, or biology. Expectations and mentorship will be tailored to the applicant’s training.</li><li>Mature coding skills: Python, Julia, or R (Python and/or Julia are preferred).</li><li>Proficiency with Machine Learning and/or System Modeling, including libraries such as PyTorch or Flux.</li><li>Knowledge of cardiovascular medicine is a plus but not required.</li><li>Ability to work independently and collaboratively.</li><li>Growth Mindset.<br><br></li></ul>Interested candidates should include a resume or CV as well as a brief cover letter describing their background and interests in their application.<br><br>EEO Statement<br><br>Massachusetts General Hospital is an Equal Opportunity Employer.By embracing diverse skills, perspectives and ideas, we choose to lead.
