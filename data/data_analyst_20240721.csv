Soils are the unsung hero in the fight against climate change. With your help we want to uncover and use this secret. As data engineer at Seqana you will acquire and harmonize data on soils to unlock the potential of soil carbon sequestration for climate protection.

About Seqana:

Seqana is an EU- and venture-backed start-up building monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) tools to drive soil carbon sequestration and the transition towards regenerative and climate-preserving agriculture.

One of the most powerful (and underutilized) solutions to climate change is capturing carbon in soils via regenerative agricultural practices. This approach has the potential for several times more climate impact than planting forests, while also providing extensive co-benefits such as erosion mitigation and improved water quality, food security, and biodiversity.

Existing solutions for MRV for the carbon market are one of the main drivers of cost and effort, and often the limiting factor for new project development. At Seqana, we combine satellite imagery, our extensive proprietary library of soil datasets, and machine learning to provide an accurate, cost-effective, and efficient MRV solution for soil organic carbon. Our product enables project developers, large corporations and NGOS with a scalable solution to measure and quantify the impact of their regenerative agricultural practices on soil carbon sequestration, enabling them to report credible CO2 reductions.

Tasks

Our growing team is looking for an ambitious and driven data engineer to help us quantify soil organic carbon and its sequestration by using better data. You will play a crucial part in developing and maintaining our data infrastructure, ensuring the seamless integration and processing of large-scale datasets. Your work will directly contribute to the advancement of our MRV tools, helping to drive effective climate solutions through innovative technology. We're looking for someone who brings an analytical mindset, and data engineering skills, as well as an interest in environmental sciences and data analysis. You will be part of a passionate team that aims to have a direct positive impact on the world. We value proactivity, authenticity, creativity, and empathy in our company culture.

Impact you’ll own:


Design, build, test, and maintain scalable databases and ETL/ELT pipelines for diverse datasets, including satellite and soil data
Manage the onboarding of new datasets and implement rigorous data quality processes
Build trusted and scalable data models to support our ML initiatives and MRV products
Standardize our data discovery, acquisition, and harmonization processes
Develop analytical data models and dashboards to serve the needs of insights and analytics
Collaborate with stakeholders across the company to constantly optimize the data infrastructure and associated processes.



Requirements

What you bring:


2-4 years of experience in data engineering / science roles, including practical experience building databases / data models and ETL processes (SQL, dbt, Python)
Solid understanding of relational databases, schema design and data quality processes, preferably in the context of MLOps and development.
Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) and their data services
Practical experience creating dashboards and analytics for technical and/or business insights
Ability to work and communicate effectively in an agile, fast-paced startup environment
A proactive, can-do attitude with the ability to quickly adapt, learn, and embrace change
Passion for environmental sustainability and climate tech



What makes you stand out:


Bonus: Experience with geospatial data (especially environmental and/or satellite data), software (PostGIS, GeoPandas, GDAL) or soil science is a big plus.
Bonus: Experience with ML development and MLOps, including model training, deployment, and monitoring is a big plus.
Bonus: Practical experience with orchestration tools (e.g. Airflow) is a plus.



Benefits

Benefits you can expect:


Be part of our highly motivated, committed, and international team with flat hierarchies that is working on solving one of societies’ biggest challenges: Climate Change
Witness and shape the evolution of a new business being built
Collaborative DevOps culture with opportunities for continuous learning and improvement
Work in a casual environment with flexible hours and some ability to work from home
Competitive salary, benefits, and compensation package
Drinks, snacks, team events, and your choice of hardware



Seqana is committed to building a workplace culture based on the values of proactivity, authenticity, creativity, and empathy, where equal employment opportunity is guaranteed to all applicants and team members regardless of their race, color, ethnicity, sex, sexual identity, religion, or disability.

At Inceptive, you will drive development forward that could help billions of people. To accomplish this, you will be part of a collaborative, antedisciplinary team building our biological software.

There are more RNA sequences coding for a single target protein than atoms in the universe. Each of these RNA sequences differs in ways that may radically affect how it performs when used in medicine. Faced with this search space, we believe that machine learning based approaches are ideally placed to tackle the RNA design problem that we work on at Inceptive.

You will be responsible for designing, testing, and scaling novel experimental protocols to characterize molecules both in vitro and in silico. You will be responsible for deriving insights from our experimental data and enabling these to drive the future development of our models and our protocols. You will work effectively in an agile setting with recurring status updates and continuous knowledge sharing. We are happy to consider candidates at various stages in their career and the position could be tailored to your experience and career preferences.

About Inceptive

At Inceptive, we are creating tools to develop increasingly powerful biological software for the rational design of novel, broadly accessible medicines and biotechnologies previously out of reach. Our team brings together vast expertise in molecular biology, machine learning, and software engineering, and we are all working towards becoming antedisciplinary, meaning we deepen the knowledge we have in our area of expertise while also expanding our knowledge of completely new fields.

We approach our goals with a beginner's mind, humbly and with fresh eyes, and aim to become the pioneers of a new discipline rooted in biology as much as in deep learning, whose impact will be realized together with out-of-the-box thinkers in business and entrepreneurship, defying established categorizations. We are building a company culture centered around growth, learning, and discovery. We believe in humility and open-mindedness in how we approach each other, as well as problems we don't yet have solutions for.

It is the policy of Inceptive to ensure equal employment opportunity without discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, national origin, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law. Inceptive prohibits any such discrimination or harassment.

About the Team

Analytics at Wolt is a business-critical competence team that covers Analytics Engineering, Data science, and Data analytics. In total, we are a team of 80+ professionals, all united by our excitement to put Wolt’s valuable data assets into everyday use.

About The Role

We're looking for awesome people to join Wolt as an Analytics Engineer role in Helsinki, Stockholm or Berlin. We have Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers working as embedded data professionals in different business domains and now we’re looking to reach the next level in data quality and advanced analytics within these domains.

As an Analytics Engineer, you will be the partner for the business leaders and product leaders. You’ll work closely with Product Leads, Software Engineers, Finance Managers and External Consultants.

We're looking for someone that is curious about solving data problems, embraces a spirit of cooperation and growth and is ready to tackle new challenges to help us support Wolt's product and business development.

Team Overview

You’ll be a part of the Analytics Engineering team!

The team focuses on all kinds of projects such as data modeling, design of pipelines, creating dashboards to describe the business and deriving insights from them.

If you are wondering whether you do possess the relevant skills and background, there is a hint for you 🙂 We are looking for potential and the right attitude so even if you are missing some of the mentioned skills but feeling strong in your SQL, apply and let’s have a discussion about it :)

Our humble expectations


3+ years of experience in data related roles - data engineering, business intelligence or analytics engineering.
Expertise with SQL and ETL tools (Airflow, dbt or similar)
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.

In addition to our country-specific benefits, our compensation package includes a monthly salary based on your expertise and equity. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you'll own a piece of the pie. 🚀
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognise that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.

We stand up for individuality. We actively foster an inclusive workplace where diversity and individual difference are valued and leveraged to achieve the agency’s vision. And most importantly we value every individual’s wellbeing.

As a diversity champion, equal opportunities and disability confident employer and an ardent advocate of flexible working we understand that everyone has unique requirements and needs.

We are a global creative agency, but the individual really is at the heart of everything we do. We use data to find out what makes them tick. We use technology to talk to them one-to-one – but to one million at a time. And we use creativity to encourage them to engage, click, buy and bond, again and again.

Each brand is unique and has its own individual challenges. We pride ourselves in rising to each and every one of them, for brands such as KFC, Mercedes Benz, IKEA, Paypal and Virgin Media 02.

Us

In order to foster collaboration and relationships, our hybrid model requires three office days per week. As equal opportunities proponents, we are open to discuss any hybrid working related needs during the initial screening.

Learning and Development is important. We all know that. Its why we have a dedicated Learning and Development team and offer regular career conversations and bespoke L&D programmes so that you can leave us with more than when you started.

We recognise that the work of diversity, equity and inclusion calls on all of us. That’s why we set up The Neighbourhood. A collective of people, at different stages of the DE&I journey, whether impacted or allies, dedicated to helping our colleagues take ownership and effect change across 4 key pillars; Anti-racism, Disability, Gender & LGBTQ+ and Parents & Carers.

The Health and Wellbeing of our people matters immensely. We offer Coaching opportunities for all through our partnerships with Sanctus (mental health partner who provides online coaching; you can talk about anything, personal or professional) and Sayge (1:1 professional development coaching program). We have 40 trained Mental Health First Aiders across the agency and have Babylon Health (Private GP service) for all.

You’re better at work when you feel better in yourself. So, in addition to your annual holiday, you can take a “Me” day and an “Us” day, every year. Your “Me” day is for you to invest in yourself – go after a life goal, meditate, learn to paint, bake cakes or just have a duvet day watching Netflix!

Your “Us” day is all about giving back and helping others – volunteer, pick litter at a local park, hang out with the elderly or raise money for a local charity.

We’re progressive and always open to new initiatives, for example we’ve recently partnered with Fertifa (Leading Fertility and Reproductive Health benefit providers). Because we know the journey to becoming a family isn’t always easy (that includes men too), and we support our people through that journey whether you are new parent, experiencing the menopause, or anything else in between.

Whatever stage of life you are at, we make sure you have the tools you need to have a healthy work life balance.

US MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

Your Role

In the Data Analytics team you will ensure both the voice of the customer and CFO are represented in the room with hard evidence. As well as supporting exceptional customer experiences using data, you will help ensure every action we take is directly improving performance against your clients objectives.

As an Analyst, you will work under supervision to deliver projects within set deadlines, utilising your strong hands on analytical capabilities. Your strengths in Python and SQL will ensure you can efficiently deliver robust analytics with guidance from your team.

Your experience with web and social analytics tools (GA / Adobe / Brandwatch / Sprinklr) and data visualisation tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker / etc) will enable you to uncover key insights across channels and create self-service dashboards.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

Job Description




The Opportunity

The Data Solutions Analyst role is an exciting opportunity to make a meaningful impact within a growing team, with potential for future growth and development.

The role of Data Solutions Analyst is about much more than analysing.

Think of yourself as the 'Data Shepherd', guiding and channelling data safely along the path to becoming valuable business solutions!

Your overall objective will be to ensure that data solutions fulfil business needs. You'll achieve that by monitoring data quality, supporting data issue resolution, brokering collaboration between business and Technology teams, and facilitating data solution development.

On a day-to-day basis, you'll be accountable for enforcing data governance practices, ensuring data compliance, and collaborating with various business stakeholders to maintain data integrity. This role is instrumental in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of our data operations, and ensuring that our data products are reliable, compliant, and valuable to the business.

If you excel in this role, then over time you'll become someone who is known for helping McDonald’s to 'get data done', and other people will seek you out for help with their data issues and requirements.

Our online platform gives schools instant access to hundreds of profiles of fully vetted teachers and support staff. Since launching in 2017, we’ve saved schools over £10m – money that goes straight back into school budgets and increases teachers’ pay.

The role:



You will work closely with the candidate onboarding team to help drive increased automation and efficiency in getting candidates onto the platform.

Passion for companies that have a positive social impact and the education sector



Who You Are 🙋



You don't just love data, but love understanding the stories the data tells about the business.
Ideally, you have either 1+ year experience as a Data Analyst, preferably in Sales or Operations, or you have recently completed a Data Analytics / Data Science bootcamp.
Good working knowledge of SQL. Proficiency in Excel is a strong plus.
Enthusiasm and an eagerness to learn. You will get support and training but we also want to hear what you think we can do better 🧠
You are able to build meaningful relationships with cross functional teams, and are a strong communicator of insights.
You are passionate about companies that have a positive social impact 🚀



What's in it for you?



Work that you want to talk about
Competitive salary
Ownership in the company
25 days of holiday
Central London office with perks like fresh fruit, yoga classes, bike parking, showers and an on-site gym and café
Fun-loving, tight-knit team solving a problem that makes a difference

Diversity and Inclusion

At Zen, we strive to build a culture of equity and inclusion, where everyone is respected, valued and appreciated for their unique traits, experiences and perspectives. We are committed to creating a safe, inclusive and equitable environment where our team can thrive, regardless of age, ethnicity, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, disability, religion or beliefs. We value our differences and believe that practices of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion help us create a fairer, more compassionate environment for all.

We welcome applicants with diverse backgrounds and different experiences and perspectives — just like the staff who teach through Zen and the children at the schools we work with. We believe in hiring the best people from the widest pool and creating an inclusive culture where people’s voices are heard and all our team can look forward to coming to work.

We are committed to building a team that reflects the diversity of our community and promoting an equitable and inclusive environment for all. We seek out diverse opinions, beliefs, and experiences because they collectively make us stronger; we’ve had former teachers, pilots, fundraisers, engineers, lawyers, marketers, social media experts and more join our team.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Awesome. Something led you here, maybe a glimpse of potential and something amazing? Well that’s how we feel about Klue.

Who are we?

Klue is a VC backed, capital-efficient high growth SaaS company. Tiger Global and Salesforce Ventures led our US$62m Series B in the fall of 2021. We’re creating the category of competitive enablement: helping companies understand their market and outmaneuver their competition. We benefit from having an experienced leadership team working alongside several hundred risk-taking builders who elevate every day.

We’re one of Canada’s Most Admired Corporate Cultures by Waterstone HC, a Deloitte Technology Fast 50 & Fast 500 winner, and recipient of both the Startup of the Year and Tech Culture of the Year awards at the Technology Impact Awards.

We’re growing and currently looking to add a Data Analyst Intern to our team.

This internship will span several functions of the Insights department and will give you a broad view of what it takes to run an innovative SaaS company. Klue is a very collaborative company where we believe in the value that can be unlocked by sharing data insights across departments and clients - you'll be getting a full picture of how a SaaS company on a rocketship trajectory operates. You’ll have many opportunities to listen in on strategic conversations and will be encouraged to ask questions along the way. As the company grows, we will have many roles to fill within the Insights department and would hope the right candidate would consider returning one day.

As a data analyst intern, you will be focused on helping our insights team ensure our data providers and outsourced content creators are delivering accurate data to their end-users.

The Data team's scope covers data validation for existing sources, outsourced content, and new potential data sources. As the data marketplace is always evolving, you will also be involved in broader projects across the team.

This is You:


Highly analytical and critical thinker
Ability to digest and communicate complex data
You like ambiguity and thrive in fast-paced environments
You have experience with Excel and/or Python
You like to learn new things and are keen to become an expert


Bonus points for...


Experience with analytics platforms, data cleaning initiatives, data gathering.


What you'll be measured on:


Ability to identify trends in data sets and develop unique solutions.
Efficiency in data gathering and data cleaning.


How We Work


Hybrid. Best of both worlds (remote & in-office)
Our main Canadian hubs are in Vancouver and Toronto, and most of our teams are located in EST and PST.
You and your team will be in office at least 2 days per week.


⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️

Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity and encourages creative solutions to problems. All new engineers deploy working code their first week, and we strive to broaden individual impact with support from managers, mentors, and teams. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment.

Are you strongly driven by a passion for data analysis, complex problem-solving, and designing business intelligence solutions? As a Business Intelligence Analyst at Yelp, you’ll work with partners and stakeholders across the company — including our Executive Leadership, Finance, BizOps, Product, Data Science, Data Engineering, Marketing, and People teams — to provide relevant data and visualization for key business decisions.

Yelp's Business Intelligence team is dedicated to empowering Yelp's leadership and analytics teams with trusted and reusable data visualizations, data warehousing products, and BI platform support. The work of our team continuously evolves with the company’s needs and is critical to Yelp’s data-driven decision making. We are looking for someone adept at engaging with business partners, who understands their needs, and who is passionate about diving into data, unraveling complexities, and designing business intelligence solutions.

This opportunity is fully remote and does not require you to be located in any particular area in Canada. We welcome applicants from throughout Canada. We’d love to have you apply, even if you don’t feel you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Yelp, we’re looking for great people, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.

What You'll Do


Build relationships with key business partners, lead requirement gathering sessions, analyze source data and systems, and provide feedback on detailed data analysis to guide data-driven decision making.
Become a subject matter expert on Yelp data and share knowledge with Engineering, Product, and other teams to refine business understanding, and identify areas of needed business improvement.
Plan and execute business intelligence/analytics projects by collaborating with business partners, data engineering, and data visualization teams.
Contribute to data strategy for data warehousing, reporting, dashboards, and self-service analytics.
Exercise advanced knowledge of SQL to extract critical information and business value from data spread across multiple databases and data formats.
Provide training and ongoing support to business users on business intelligence products.


What It Takes To Succeed

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

          <strong>About Stripe<br><br></strong>Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.<br><br><strong>About The Team<br><br></strong>Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together.

You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.<br><br>Who you are<br><br>We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.<br><br><strong>Minimum Requirements<br><br></strong><ul><li>2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems</li><li>Proficiency in SQL and Python</li><li>Strong statistical knowledge</li><li>Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals</li><li>Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail</li><li>Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact</li><li>Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.<br><br><br></li></ul><strong>Preferred Qualifications<br><br></strong><ul><li>Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.</li><li>Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.</li><li>Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.</li><li>Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.<br><br><br></li></ul>Hybrid work at Stripe<br><br>This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).<br><br>Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.<br><br>A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.<br><br>Pay and benefits<br><br>The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.<br><br>Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity and encourages creative solutions to problems. All new engineers deploy working code their first week, and we strive to broaden individual impact with support from managers, mentors, and teams. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment.

Are you strongly driven by a passion for data analysis, complex problem-solving, and designing business intelligence solutions? As a Business Intelligence Analyst at Yelp, you’ll work with partners and stakeholders across the company — including our Executive Leadership, Finance, BizOps, Product, Data Science, Data Engineering, Marketing, and People teams — to provide relevant data and visualization for key business decisions.

Yelp's Business Intelligence team is dedicated to empowering Yelp's leadership and analytics teams with trusted and reusable data visualizations, data warehousing products, and BI platform support. The work of our team continuously evolves with the company’s needs and is critical to Yelp’s data-driven decision making. We are looking for someone adept at engaging with business partners, who understands their needs, and who is passionate about diving into data, unraveling complexities, and designing business intelligence solutions.

This opportunity is fully remote and does not require you to be located in any particular area in Canada. We welcome applicants from throughout Canada. We’d love to have you apply, even if you don’t feel you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Yelp, we’re looking for great people, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.

Build relationships with key business partners, lead requirement gathering sessions, analyze source data and systems, and provide feedback on detailed data analysis to guide data-driven decision making.
Become a subject matter expert on Yelp data and share knowledge with Engineering, Product, and other teams to refine business understanding, and identify areas of needed business improvement.
Plan and execute business intelligence/analytics projects by collaborating with business partners, data engineering, and data visualization teams.
Contribute to data strategy for data warehousing, reporting, dashboards, and self-service analytics.
Exercise advanced knowledge of SQL to extract critical information and business value from data spread across multiple databases and data formats.
Provide training and ongoing support to business users on business intelligence products.


What It Takes To Succeed


Ideally 3 years of experience in business intelligence or as a business systems analyst, data analyst/developer or similar role.
Experience with data visualization tools (Tableau preferred).
Experience documenting business and technical requirements and directly interacting with engineers on business intelligence projects.
Excellent collaboration, communication, negotiation, and presentation skills.
Working knowledge of statistics and KPIs (LTV, Churn, etc.).
Advanced SQL skills and experience writing complex queries.
Knowledge and working experience with dimensional data modeling.


What You'll Get


Compensation range is $82,000-230,000 annually. Depending on your role and level, you may also be offered a bonus, restricted stock units, and benefits.

Otherwise, team members are welcome to work from home for their daily deep work. We provide a stipend to purchase work-from-home equipment.

Twice a year, we host a 3-day onsite called ChargeFest. All remote team members fly to Toronto for this event. In-person attendance of ChargeFest is mandatory.

The successful candidate will have significant experience working with teams in complex and diverse environments, a deep understanding of Indigeneity and critical race theory, and is experienced in navigating difficult conversations relating to power, privilege, discrimination, conflict engagement, and equity and inclusion.

This role will support the work of the EIO, as the key individual responsible for analyzing, reporting, and supporting the collection of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) evidence and related data. The analyst will provide senior-level analytical support to executive officers, Deans, Directors, and the community. The analyst will provide equity, diversity, and inclusion analysis in support of planning, policy formulation, and decision-making activities. The analyst will plan, design, conduct, and implement major research projects and studies, interpret results, and make formal presentations. The core work of this position is the development of institutional data infrastructure (dashboards, data dictionaries, working groups, access protocols, etc.) needed to inform research, analysis, and evaluation across several strategic initiatives focused on EDI at UBC.

Organizational Status

The EDI Data Analyst position will work with two offices, the Equity & Inclusion Office (EIO) and the Planning and Institutional Research Office (PAIR).

Job Summary

This individual is a member of the Vaccine Evaluation Center (VEC) whose primary role is to provide consultation to Investigators in the identification of data, and on data collection processes and study outcome on multiple studies as dictated by study protocols. The position coordinates the tasks performed by the data team and involves supervision of the data team. These studies have varying levels of complexities requiring an overall understanding of the data structures and programming.

Organizational Status

Exercises data management judgement (including non-routine) and is accountable for own directed actions. Makes judgements as to how the decision fits with acceptable Good Clinical Data Management Practices and what the impact of the decision will be. Reports to Senior Data Manager of the VEC.

Work Performed

Development of highly-specialized case report forms (CRFs) for each study. The project team consists of the investigator(s), field administrators, study coordinator, statistician and data coordinator who decide what information is required for a study and how it will be collected. Using this information, the data coordinator will formulate the CRF that will encompass all the needs of the study and maintain good clinical data management practise guidelines. The investigator(s) have final approval of the CRFs. Each study is faced with unique issues and the data coordinator must research and evaluate appropriate uses of data collection tools, usage of words in questions and style of questions. The data coordinator is continually evaluating the CRFs and accompanying user’s manual to ensure that the best possible tools are provided for the study.

The data coordinator is responsible for designing and implementing systems for organizing and managing the flow of data from the field through data management to analysis and to long term storage. This requires good organizational skills as there can be 15-20 different studies in progress and at different stages. In addition, data is received from many different sites across Canada in multi-centre clinical trials, which adds to the complexity of the job. This individual supervises the work of the data entry and data monitoring staff. This involves training and monitoring staff, reviewing workload assignments and adjusting schedules to reflect changes and priorities within the VEC.

The data coordinator manages the data throughout the course of each study ensuring that all work performed by study staff adheres to policies and standards. The data coordinator is responsible for maintenance of the database until study completion. Upon meeting all requirements for clean data, the database is given to the Statistician. Each study and sponsor have different needs making each study unique. The individual must be adaptable to the needs of each study to ensure good clinical data management practices are maintained.

Databases (both routine and complex) are custom designed and maintained by the data coordinator. This requires an in-depth working knowledge of software being used and keeping abreast of software changes as they occur. Maintaining and upgrading of the databases forms part of the duties.

Works in conjunction with the statistician to develop descriptive aggregate statistics for data cleanup and ensure that final statistical programme incorporates data management decisions during the study.

When necessary, provides basic statistical programming support as per pre-defined analysis plan.

The data coordinator is responsible for the long-term storage of VEC data that conforms to government set standards. The data coordinator needs to keep up with changes in the technology and acceptable practices.

Consequence of Error/Judgement

Errors in judgement can result in significant damage to the Vaccine Evaluation Center’s academic reputation as a centre of excellence, nationally and internationally. Poorly designed databases can result in higher study costs because of extra time spent dealing with data entry, data management and data analysis. Poorly designed databases can also result in making it difficult to perform effective data analysis affecting the overall science of the study. Ineffective training of data staff has budgetary and human resource implications. The systems to organize and manage the flow of data that are not appropriately designed can lead to financial problems as well as problems with conforming to good clinical data management guidelines.

Supervision Received

Receives general directions from project team leader(s) and the investigator(s) as part of the specified project team for study related issues. Study related work is reviewed by the Senior Data Manager.

Supervision Given

Supervises the data staff, a group that includes up to 8 research assistants and data monitoring staff. This includes assigning and monitoring the work, training staff and participating in job evaluation/performance measures. Works with the statistician to coordinate the flow and priority setting of the data and the analysis. Works with the field administrator(s) to ensure the efficient flow of data from the field to the data team and to coordinate workload of research assistant staff.

Minimum Qualifications


Undergraduate degree in a relevant discipline. Minimum of two years of related experience, or the equivalent combination of education and experience.
Willingness to respect diverse perspectives, including perspectives in conflict with one’s own
Demonstrates a commitment to enhancing one’s own awareness, knowledge, and skills related to equity, diversity, and inclusion


Preferred Qualifications

University degree in Computer Science is strongly recommended with additional courses in the Health Care Field desired. Related experience in data management of clinical trials with preference for vaccine trials is required. Minimum 2 years supervisory skills.

Skills

Demonstrated knowledge of web-based clinical data management software. Experience in SAS® statistical software is required. Ability to perform advanced programming. Demonstrated information management skills are required. Ability to communicate effectively verbally and in writing. Proven problem solving, analytical and decision making skills. Ability to maintain accuracy and attention to detail. Ability to work effectively independently and in a team environment.

Job Summary

This individual is a member of the Vaccine Evaluation Center (VEC) whose primary role is to provide consultation to Investigators in the identification of data, and on data collection processes and study outcome on multiple studies as dictated by study protocols. The position coordinates the tasks performed by the data team and involves supervision of the data team. These studies have varying levels of complexities requiring an overall understanding of the data structures and programming.

Organizational Status

Exercises data management judgement (including non-routine) and is accountable for own directed actions. Makes judgements as to how the decision fits with acceptable Good Clinical Data Management Practices and what the impact of the decision will be. Reports to Senior Data Manager of the VEC.

Work Performed

Development of highly-specialized case report forms (CRFs) for each study. The project team consists of the investigator(s), field administrators, study coordinator, statistician and data coordinator who decide what information is required for a study and how it will be collected. Using this information, the data coordinator will formulate the CRF that will encompass all the needs of the study and maintain good clinical data management practise guidelines. The investigator(s) have final approval of the CRFs. Each study is faced with unique issues and the data coordinator must research and evaluate appropriate uses of data collection tools, usage of words in questions and style of questions. The data coordinator is continually evaluating the CRFs and accompanying user’s manual to ensure that the best possible tools are provided for the study.

The data coordinator is responsible for designing and implementing systems for organizing and managing the flow of data from the field through data management to analysis and to long term storage. This requires good organizational skills as there can be 15-20 different studies in progress and at different stages. In addition, data is received from many different sites across Canada in multi-centre clinical trials, which adds to the complexity of the job. This individual supervises the work of the data entry and data monitoring staff. This involves training and monitoring staff, reviewing workload assignments and adjusting schedules to reflect changes and priorities within the VEC.

The data coordinator manages the data throughout the course of each study ensuring that all work performed by study staff adheres to policies and standards. The data coordinator is responsible for maintenance of the database until study completion. Upon meeting all requirements for clean data, the database is given to the Statistician. Each study and sponsor have different needs making each study unique. The individual must be adaptable to the needs of each study to ensure good clinical data management practices are maintained.

Databases (both routine and complex) are custom designed and maintained by the data coordinator. This requires an in-depth working knowledge of software being used and keeping abreast of software changes as they occur. Maintaining and upgrading of the databases forms part of the duties.

Works in conjunction with the statistician to develop descriptive aggregate statistics for data cleanup and ensure that final statistical programme incorporates data management decisions during the study.

When necessary, provides basic statistical programming support as per pre-defined analysis plan.

The data coordinator is responsible for the long-term storage of VEC data that conforms to government set standards. The data coordinator needs to keep up with changes in the technology and acceptable practices.

Consequence of Error/Judgement

Errors in judgement can result in significant damage to the Vaccine Evaluation Center’s academic reputation as a centre of excellence, nationally and internationally. Poorly designed databases can result in higher study costs because of extra time spent dealing with data entry, data management and data analysis. Poorly designed databases can also result in making it difficult to perform effective data analysis affecting the overall science of the study. Ineffective training of data staff has budgetary and human resource implications. The systems to organize and manage the flow of data that are not appropriately designed can lead to financial problems as well as problems with conforming to good clinical data management guidelines.

Supervision Received

Receives general directions from project team leader(s) and the investigator(s) as part of the specified project team for study related issues. Study related work is reviewed by the Senior Data Manager.

Supervision Given

Supervises the data staff, a group that includes up to 8 research assistants and data monitoring staff. This includes assigning and monitoring the work, training staff and participating in job evaluation/performance measures. Works with the statistician to coordinate the flow and priority setting of the data and the analysis. Works with the field administrator(s) to ensure the efficient flow of data from the field to the data team and to coordinate workload of research assistant staff.

Minimum Qualifications


Undergraduate degree in a relevant discipline. Minimum of two years of related experience, or the equivalent combination of education and experience.
Willingness to respect diverse perspectives, including perspectives in conflict with one’s own
Demonstrates a commitment to enhancing one’s own awareness, knowledge, and skills related to equity, diversity, and inclusion


Preferred Qualifications

University degree in Computer Science is strongly recommended with additional courses in the Health Care Field desired. Related experience in data management of clinical trials with preference for vaccine trials is required. Minimum 2 years supervisory skills.

Skills

Demonstrated knowledge of web-based clinical data management software. Experience in SAS® statistical software is required. Ability to perform advanced programming. Demonstrated information management skills are required. Ability to communicate effectively verbally and in writing. Proven problem solving, analytical and decision making skills. Ability to maintain accuracy and attention to detail. Ability to work effectively independently and in a team environment. Ability to work under pressure to meet deadlines and to set priorities for concurrent projects.
