Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our focus is on providing oversight and protection of the TikTok platform and U.S. user data, so millions of Americans can continue turning to TikTok to learn something new, earn a living, express themselves creatively, or be entertained. The teams within USDS that deliver on this commitment daily span across Trust & Safety, Security & Privacy, Engineering, User & Product Ops, Corporate Functions and more.

Why Join Us
Creation is the core of TikTok's purpose. Our platform is built to help imaginations thrive. This is doubly true of the teams that make TikTok possible.
Together, we inspire creativity and bring joy - a mission we all believe in and aim towards achieving every day.
To us, every challenge, no matter how difficult, is an opportunity; to learn, to innovate, and to grow as one team. Status quo? Never. Courage? Always.
At TikTok, we create together and grow together. That's how we drive impact - for ourselves, our company, and the communities we serve.
Join us.

The USDS-Platform and Community Integrity (PaCI) team is missioned to: - Protect U.S. TikTok users, including and beyond content consumers, creators, and advertisers; - Secure platform health and community experience authenticity; - Build infrastructures, platforms, and technologies, as well as to collaborate with many cross-functional teams and stakeholders. The PaCI team works to minimize the damage of inauthentic behaviors on TikTok platforms, covering multiple classical and novel community and business risk areas such as account integrity, engagement authenticity, anti-spam, API abuse, growth fraud, live streaming security and financial safety, etc. In this team, you'll have a unique opportunity to have first-hand exposure to the strategy of the company in key security initiatives, especially in building scalable and robust, intelligent and privacy-safe, secure, and product-friendly systems and solutions. Our challenges are not some regular day-to-day technical puzzles -- You'll be part of a team that's developing novel solutions to first-seen challenges of a non-stop evolution of a phenomenal product eco-system. The work needs to be fast, transferrable, while still down to the ground to make quick and solid differences.

In order to enhance collaboration and cross-functional partnerships, among other things, at this time, our organization follows a hybrid work schedule that requires employees to work in the office 3 days a week, or as directed by their manager/department. We regularly review our hybrid work model, and the specific requirements may change at any time.

Responsibilities
Build rules to recognize, mitigate or prevent risky inauthentic behaviors on TikTok and its extended platforms. Such risks include and are not limited to abusive accounts, fake engagements, spammy redirection, scraping, fraud, etc.
Analyze business, product and security data, uncover evolving attack motion, identify weaknesses and opportunities in risk defense solutions, explore new space from the discoveries.
Quantify risk control effects and trends, collaborate with engineering, modeling, operational and product colleagues, contribute to risk measurement, perception, mitigation and prevention with data stories.

Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications:
Bachelor or degrees above in computer science, statistics, math, internet security or other relevant majors (e.g., finance if applying for financial fraud roles)
Strong analytical skills. Proficiency in statistical analytical tools, such as SQL and Python.

Preferred Qualifications:

Ability to think critically, objectively, rationally. Reason and communicate in result-oriented, data-driven manner. High autonomy.

Candidates for this position must be legally authorized to work in the United States. This position is not eligible for visa sponsorship or support.

TikTok is committed to creating an inclusive space where employees are valued for their skills, experiences, and unique perspectives. Our platform connects people from across the globe and so does our workplace. At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. To achieve that goal, we are committed to celebrating our diverse voices and to creating an environment that reflects the many communities we reach. We are passionate about this and hope you are too.

About TikTok U.S. Data Security
TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. U.S. Data Security (“USDS”) is a subsidiary of TikTok in the U.S. This new, security-first division was created to bring heightened focus and governance to our data protection policies and content assurance protocols to keep U.S. users safe. Our focus is on providing oversight and protection of the TikTok platform and U.S. user data, so millions of Americans can continue turning to TikTok to learn something new, earn a living, express themselves creatively, or be entertained. The teams within USDS that deliver on this commitment daily span across Trust & Safety, Security & Privacy, Engineering, User & Product Ops, Corporate Functions and more.

Why Join Us
Creation is the core of TikTok's purpose. Our platform is built to help imaginations thrive. This is doubly true of the teams that make TikTok possible.
Together, we inspire creativity and bring joy - a mission we all believe in and aim towards achieving every day.
To us, every challenge, no matter how difficult, is an opportunity; to learn, to innovate, and to grow as one team. Status quo? Never. Courage? Always.
At TikTok, we create together and grow together. That's how we drive impact - for ourselves, our company, and the communities we serve.
Join us.

The USDS-Platform and Community Integrity (PaCI) team is missioned to: - Protect U.S. TikTok users, including and beyond content consumers, creators, and advertisers; - Secure platform health and community experience authenticity; - Build infrastructures, platforms, and technologies, as well as to collaborate with many cross-functional teams and stakeholders. The PaCI team works to minimize the damage of inauthentic behaviors on TikTok platforms, covering multiple classical and novel community and business risk areas such as account integrity, engagement authenticity, anti-spam, API abuse, growth fraud, live streaming security and financial safety, etc. In this team, you'll have a unique opportunity to have first-hand exposure to the strategy of the company in key security initiatives, especially in building scalable and robust, intelligent and privacy-safe, secure, and product-friendly systems and solutions.

The work needs to be fast, transferrable, while still down to the ground to make quick and solid differences.

In order to enhance collaboration and cross-functional partnerships, among other things, at this time, our organization follows a hybrid work schedule that requires employees to work in the office 3 days a week, or as directed by their manager/department.

Quantify risk control effects and trends, collaborate with engineering, modeling, operational and product colleagues, contribute to risk measurement, perception, mitigation and prevention with data stories.

Preferred Qualifications:

TikTok is committed to creating an inclusive space where employees are valued for their skills, experiences, and unique perspectives. Our platform connects people from across the globe and so does our workplace. At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. To achieve that goal, we are committed to celebrating our diverse voices and to creating an environment that reflects the many communities we reach. We are passionate about this and hope you are too.

At Hiya we are on a mission to secure the voice call with trust, identity, and intelligence. We're protecting everyday people from spam and fraud calls, connecting businesses with their customers, and helping mobile carriers secure their networks for all. In early 2016, we brought Hiya Protect to market through Samsung Smart Call, AT&T Call Protect (now Active Armor) the first-ever network-based spam solution, and the Hiya consumer app for iOS & Android. Three years later in 2019, we brought Hiya Connect to market, a B2B branded call SaaS solution that enables companies to connect to the consumers they are trying to reach. The combination of Protect, Connect, and the Hiya app has resulted in the world's largest Voice Security Platform with over 450M users.

About the Position

The Senior Data Analyst is an individual contributor position responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to both improve and demonstrate the performance of Hiya's security and protection products. The Senior Data Analyst drives improvement both at the high level, with project management duties related to the flow and processing of data, but also at a low level creating high quality robust dashboards. As a Senior Data Analyst you will strive to become a subject matter expert in the products you are working on and potentially participate in customer meetings.

The ideal candidate will be comfortable with some project management duties related to data. This may include things like sourcing data, managing competitive tests, and collecting dashboard requirements from other teams.

This employee works with a team of product managers, solutions architects, scientists, engineers and other analysts whose mission is to provide the best system for identifying spam and fraud activity on telecom networks across the globe.

We're excited about you because you're the kind of person that thinks at a systems level. When you have a task before you, you seek to understand the conditions that led to it as you design your solution. You are organized and able to push to completion activities and involve not only your individual activities but also external data vendors and processors. You're a lifelong learner and a mentor, equally happy to learn from your colleagues as you are to share knowledge with them.

You have a special skill in using data in order to tell a story to others, either externally or within the company. You reach beyond the charts and numbers to understand the real implications of what you find. You're able to be guided by your analysis to find valuable new threads to pursue, either to get a more complete picture or to find unique perspectives in the research. And once fully pursued, you can use this knowledge to tell the story to others, building a simple and non-technical narrative to explain what you've found.

What You'll Do


Manage and maintain pipelines and processes of data within Hiya, from sourcing to ingestion to analysis
Regularly work with BD, Sales, and Marketing to help them find stories within our data that furthers their own objectives
Frequently work with the Data Science team to explore new theories about voice call traffic worldwide
Develop and maintain production-quality dashboards able to be used internally and externally as tools to assist others in their own analyses
Conduct various tests on service performance, and write documentation to summarize those results


Qualities that will make you successful:


Excellent communication skills and the ability to simplify complex concepts
Strong SQL analytical skills
Familiarity with python / R or equivalent for automation
Strong experience with BI platforms including Sigma, and Tableau
Familiarity with big data analytics systems like Databricks
Familiarity with workflow management systems like Airflow
Well-practiced ability to timebox your own work; you intuitively know which threads to pursue, and how far to pursue them in your research
Self-driven curiosity to understand the data (and the implications behind it)


The person in this role must embody Hiya's key values of Serving our customers, Doing rather than observing, Improving ourselves and our business, Owning and holding ourselves accountable for success, and Leading by showing up with a point of view, engaging in open discussion, listening respectfully to others opinions and committing to decisions.

You will have a fast start if you have experience:


Working in AWS Databricks workbooks and building dashboards
Developing advanced SQL queries including window functions
Optimizing queries for efficient performance in millions or even billions of records
Writing one-pagers and executive summaries based on your research


The requirements listed in the job descriptions are guidelines. You don't have to satisfy every requirement or meet every qualification listed. If your skills are transferable we would still love to hear from you.

The base salary for this role is between $136,500-$204,000. When determining compensation, a number of factors will be considered: skills, experience, job scope, location, and competitive compensation market data.

You will also collaborate with a variety of internal partner teams across Azure and Microsoft.

The value of your work will be reflected in improvements to the Azure platform, Azure service capacity fulfillment rate, customer satisfaction, and various efficiency metrics, including COGS reduction. You will have opportunities for mentorship, accelerate your career growth, and work on truly high-business impact areas.

Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The mission of the People Analytics team is to improve Stripe’s performance by collecting data, measuring critical constructs, and generating insights that help Stripe attract, develop, and retain our most important asset - our Stripes.

As a team, we’re a group of individuals with diverse backgrounds across consulting, HR, and other data-focused domains who are curious, passionate, and obsessed with using science and data to deliver high-value precise outputs to our users.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and present comprehensive analysis to influence and enable decision-making
Collaborate seamlessly with cross functional partner teams, internal stakeholders, and business leaders
Contribute valuable insights to our People Organization to improve our evolving processes and programs
Design, build and enable the delivery of analytics products through our BI, visualization, and analytics platforms including Tableau, Visier and Saratoga
Identify, build, validate, enable and upkeep people metrics
Conduct ad hoc analyses received through intake requests from partner teams
Partner with data engineering to identify and execute improvements against our existing workforce data ecosystem



Who you are

We’re looking for an analytics leader who will help us in our ongoing journey to build a world class People Analytics team and improve the overall employee experience and productivity of our Stripes. You are someone who is curious, has an eye towards craftsmanship and enjoys working in a fast-paced environment. Through your work, you will likely need to partner closely with our People Research & Insights team, People Partners, People Org teams, and Business teams to identify opportunities for greatest impact - then deliver value through creative problem-solving, actionable insights, and effective people practices. Examples of projects this individual may lead include evaluating interview effectiveness, collaborating with Finance to forecast hiring costs and volumes in new geographies, and developing dashboards focused on opportunities to improve return to office.

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience working in management consulting or analytics (people analytics experience is a plus)
Strong data visualization skills - must be able to create clean visuals that highlight key findings and tell a compelling story
Experience communicating technical concepts clearly, with all audiences
Experience with multiple data analysis and visualization tools (Tableau and Visier preferred); experience with a scripting language (Python or R) is a plus
Experience with human capital benchmarking and target setting
Flexible and comfortable with ambiguity (our environment changes rapidly, and your work might too!).
Knowledge of data architecture, design, development, and QA/QC processes
Ability to manage competing priorities and timelines to deliver high-quality solutions, as-promised and on-time



Preferred Qualifications


A bias toward automation and efficiency, with the know-how to cleanly structure data to enable continuous delivery of insights
A desire to promote self-service capabilities for stakeholders
You have operated across the full lifecycle of analytics projects - requirements gathering, data collection, data cleansing, analysis, visualization, QA/QC, and deployment
You have a bias towards action and an ability to iterate towards an end state
Stay up to date on best practices, scientific findings, and case studies in the world of people analytics and measurement
You can bring structure to ambiguity



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $130,900 - $196,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

As Notion continues to grow rapidly, we're seeking talented data engineers to join our team and help us build foundational datasets and pipelines, as well as the infrastructure that supports them. Your work will accelerate the decision-making process of key product and business functions. If you're passionate about analytics use cases, data models, and solving complex data problems, then this is the team for you!

What You'll Achieve


You'll define the processes and ETL infrastructure to transform and make data readily available across the company
You'll build core datasets to serve as unique sources of truth for product and business functions (product, marketing, sales, finance, customer experience, data science, business operations, IT, engineering)
You'll partner with data scientists and other internal stakeholders to understand their needs and then design, build and monitor pipelines that meet today's requirements but can gracefully scale with our growing data size
You'll implement automated workflows that lower manual/operational cost for stakeholders, define and uphold SLAs for timely delivery of data, move the company closer to democratizing data and a self-serve model (query exploration, dashboards, data catalog, data discovery)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You are a self-starter and continuously gather and synthesize high-impact needs from business partners, designing and implementing the appropriate technical solutions, and effectively communicating about deliverables, timelines and tradeoffs
You've spent 4+ years as a data engineer building core datasets and supporting business verticals as needed. You are passionate about analytics use cases, data models and solving complex data problems
You have hands-on experience shipping scalable data solutions in the cloud (e.g AWS, GCP, Azure), across multiple data stores (e.g Snowflake, Redshift, Hive, SQL/NoSQL, columnar storage formats) and methodologies (e.g dimensional modeling, data marts, star/snowflake schemas)
You are a SQL expert. You intimately understand aggregation functions, window functions, UDFs, self-joins, partitioning and clustering approaches to run correct and highly-performant queries
You are highly comfortable with object-oriented programming paradigms (e.g Python, Java, Scala)



Nice To Haves


You’ve worked at a fast-growing company, a SaaS company or are eager to contribute in such an environment (being a current Notion user would also be great!)
You have hands-on experience in designing and building highly scalable and reliable data pipelines using BigData stack (e.g Airflow, DBT, Spark, Hive, Parquet/ORC, Protobuf/Thrift, etc)



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $170,000 - $235,000 per year.

About TikTok U.S. Data Security
TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. U.S. Data Security (“USDS”) is a subsidiary of TikTok in the U.S. This new, security-first division was created to bring heightened focus and governance to our data protection policies and content assurance protocols to keep U.S. users safe. Our focus is on providing oversight and protection of the TikTok platform and U.S. user data, so millions of Americans can continue turning to TikTok to learn something new, earn a living, express themselves creatively, or be entertained. The teams within USDS that deliver on this commitment daily span across Trust & Safety, Security & Privacy, Engineering, User & Product Ops, Corporate Functions and more.

Why Join Us
Creation is the core of TikTok's purpose. Our platform is built to help imaginations thrive. This is doubly true of the teams that make TikTok possible.
Together, we inspire creativity and bring joy - a mission we all believe in and aim towards achieving every day.
To us, every challenge, no matter how difficult, is an opportunity; to learn, to innovate, and to grow as one team. Status quo? Never. Courage? Always.
At TikTok, we create together and grow together. That's how we drive impact - for ourselves, our company, and the communities we serve.
Join us.

The USDS-Platform and Community Integrity (PaCI) team is missioned to: - Protect U.S. TikTok users, including and beyond content consumers, creators, and advertisers; - Secure platform health and community experience authenticity; - Build infrastructures, platforms, and technologies, as well as to collaborate with many cross-functional teams and stakeholders. The PaCI team works to minimize the damage of inauthentic behaviors on TikTok platforms, covering multiple classical and novel community and business risk areas such as account integrity, engagement authenticity, anti-spam, API abuse, growth fraud, live streaming security and financial safety, etc. In this team, you'll have a unique opportunity to have first-hand exposure to the strategy of the company in key security initiatives, especially in building scalable and robust, intelligent and privacy-safe, secure, and product-friendly systems and solutions. Our challenges are not some regular day-to-day technical puzzles -- You'll be part of a team that's developing novel solutions to first-seen challenges of a non-stop evolution of a phenomenal product eco-system. The work needs to be fast, transferrable, while still down to the ground to make quick and solid differences.

In order to enhance collaboration and cross-functional partnerships, among other things, at this time, our organization follows a hybrid work schedule that requires employees to work in the office 3 days a week, or as directed by their manager/department. We regularly review our hybrid work model, and the specific requirements may change at any time.

Build rules to recognize, mitigate or prevent risky inauthentic behaviors on TikTok and its extended platforms. Such risks include and are not limited to abusive accounts, fake engagements, spammy redirection, scraping, fraud, etc.
Analyze business, product and security data, uncover evolving attack motion, identify weaknesses and opportunities in risk defense solutions, explore new space from the discoveries.
Quantify risk control effects and trends, collaborate with engineering, modeling, operational and product colleagues, contribute to risk measurement, perception, mitigation and prevention with data stories.

Qualifications

Bachelor or degrees above in computer science, statistics, math, internet security or other relevant majors (e.g., finance if applying for financial fraud roles)

Ability to think critically, objectively, rationally. Reason and communicate in result-oriented, data-driven manner. High autonomy.

Candidates for this position must be legally authorized to work in the United States. This position is not eligible for visa sponsorship or support.

TikTok is committed to creating an inclusive space where employees are valued for their skills, experiences, and unique perspectives. Our platform connects people from across the globe and so does our workplace. At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. To achieve that goal, we are committed to celebrating our diverse voices and to creating an environment that reflects the many communities we reach. We are passionate about this and hope you are too.

Our mission is simple: Make our cities better places to live through carsharing.

Carsharing empowers people to move in a smarter and more sustainable way: studies show that one shared car replaces between 4 and 10 privately owned cars, which frees up space in our cities while giving communities 24/7 access to cars when they need them.

With our connected car technology, users can quickly and easily book and unlock a wide variety of vehicles directly from our app, without ever having to meet anyone in person, carry an access card, wait in line, or coordinate picking up keys.

To reach our vision of a world where all cars are shared, we need a strong team to help us disrupt car ownership. We look for people who are curious, positive, and engaged; who can adapt and learn quickly; who have the skills and smarts to reach their goals autonomously, while having the generosity and mindset to work collaboratively. No matter your role, background, or level of experience, we believe that every member of the team can have an impact.

We’re extremely proud to be certified in the “Best Workplaces” in 2023 !

Our mission is simple: Make our cities better places to live through carsharing.

Carsharing empowers people to move in a smarter and more sustainable way: studies show that one shared car replaces between 4 and 10 privately owned cars, which frees up space in our cities while giving communities 24/7 access to cars when they need them.

With our connected car technology, users can quickly and easily book and unlock a wide variety of vehicles directly from our app, without ever having to meet anyone in person, carry an access card, wait in line, or coordinate picking up keys.

To reach our vision of a world where all cars are shared, we need a strong team to help us disrupt car ownership. We look for people who are curious, positive, and engaged; who can adapt and learn quickly; who have the skills and smarts to reach their goals autonomously, while having the generosity and mindset to work collaboratively. No matter your role, background, or level of experience, we believe that every member of the team can have an impact.

Junior Data Analist

Als Junior Data Analist binnen het Group Procurement team ondersteun je de Analytics en Data Controller bij het verbeteren, uitbreiden en onderhouden van gegevens in het inkoopsysteem.

In deze veelzijdige rol met veel internationale uitdagingen, krijg je alle ruimte om je talenten verder te ontwikkelen!

Wat jij gaat doen

Jouw taken zullen zich vooral richten op het ondersteunen van het leveren van prestatiemanagementgegevens en -analyses aan het Group Procurement-team. Je zorgt ervoor dat systemen correct zijn ingevuld en dat gegevens beschikbaar zijn.

Je ontwerpt, ontwikkelt en onderhoudt interactieve dashboards en periodieke rapportages en draagt bij aan de ontwikkeling van onze methodes en tools voor data-analyse.

Daarbij ben je in staat om diepgaande analyses en vanuit daar aanbevelingen te doen. Zo ondersteun jij met data besluitvorming. Hierbij heb je een centrale en cruciale rol.

Je ondersteunt onze Category Managers, Category Buyers en (Senior) Buyers bij de ontwikkeling van o.a. strategieën en RFx-documentatie om ervoor te zorgen dat we over accurate gegevens beschikken bij onze eerste gesprekken met leveranciers tot aan de informatie over de gunning van contracten. Hierbij werk je samen met alle (inter)nationale procurement teams binnen Urenco. Daarbij verzorg je (on)gevraagde analyses voor het Inkoop Management Team.

Je herkent jezelf in de volgende kenmerken of eigenschappen


Schijnbaar moeiteloos weet jij trends uit grote datasets te toveren. Je bent een ICT-liefhebber en een Excel-specialist ineen;
Jij bent iemand die zelfstandig kan werken, een echte specialist is en nieuwsgierig is naar de toekomst;
Je beschikt over analytische vaardigheden en het vermogen om complexe problemen te doorgronden;
Je bent een teamspeler en weet met jouw goede communicatieve vaardigheden makkelijk de verbinding met je team te vinden.


Wat wij vragen van jou


Je hebt een relevante afgeronde hbo- of wo-opleiding, zoals Data Science;
Power BI, SAP, SharePoint kennen geen geheimen voor jou;
Je beheerst Engels vloeiend, Duits is een pré;
Enkele jaren relevante werkervaring is een pré.


Wat hebben we jou te bieden?


Een uitdagende rol met goede ontwikkeling- en arbeidsmogelijkheden: wij investeren in wat jij nodig hebt;
Een uitstekend startsalaris, afhankelijk van kennis en ervaring, max €4000,- bruto;
Een goede werk-/privé balans: flexibele werkuren, mogelijkheid tot hybride werken en 38,5 dagen verlof per jaar op basis van een fulltime dienstverband;
Zeer goede secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden zoals 8% vakantiegeld, 4% middenjaarsuitkering, 3% eindejaarsuitkering, een resultaatafhankelijke uitkering en een bijdrage aan de collectieve zorgverzekering;
In 2040 opereren we CO2-neutraal! Zelf ook je steentje bijdragen aan duurzaamheid? Onze energiewerkgroep kan altijd nieuwe ideeën gebruiken;
Onze personeelsvereniging staat bekend om zijn leuke uitjes en geweldige feestjes;
Ruimte om vrijwilligerswerk te doen;
Aandacht voor een KERNgezonde versie van jezelf met diverse activiteiten op het gebied van leefstijl, balans en werkplezier.


Waar kom je te werken?

Urenco is de spil in een wereldwijd netwerk voor schone energieopwekking. Met ons product, verrijkt uranium, maken kerncentrales CO2-vrije elektriciteit voor 100 miljoen gezinnen, bedrijven en scholen. Urenco heeft zorg voor mens en milieu hoog in het vaandel staan. Onze mensen krijgen energie van hun werk en geven dat door aan anderen. Zij bepalen het succes van de organisatie. Wij doen er daarom alles aan om een diverse en inclusieve organisatie te zijn, waar iedereen zich welkom en gewaardeerd voelt. De huidige situatie in de wereld heeft geleid tot ontwikkelingen op de verrijkingsmarkt: kerncentrales zoeken naar leveringszekerheid en dat heeft geleid tot een grote toename in de vraag naar ons verrijkt uranium. Als onderdeel daarvan, zetten we in op capaciteitsuitbreiding, onder meer door twee nieuwe verrijkingshallen in Almelo. En daar kunnen we jouw kennis en ambitie goed bij gebruiken!

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Ready to ? Who you are:


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.


Institutional Operations Solutions are responsible for the day to day operations and support of Coinbase’s suite of Institutional Products and Services. We are focused on managing risk and building scale in operations processes as well as providing exceptional customer service to our Institutional clients. As a Data Analyst on our team, you will help drive business impact through data.

Topics of interest to the lab include inverse problems, digital twins, modeling cardiovascular hemodynamics, reinforcement learning for decision support in the intensive care unit, automated electrocardiogram analysis, predicting catastrophic clinical events such as cardiac arrests, and learning novel patient representations from their data. We have a particular interest in critical care medicine, where the stakes are highest, patient complexity is the greatest, and the amount of data far outstrips any clinician’s ability to process it. Applicants will be jointly supervised by Dr. Aguirre and Dr. Houstis of the Cardiovascular Research Center (CVRC).

The starting point for any project will entail assembling a deep data record of patient signals using a database we have assembled, one rare in its scope and size. The experience of working with such a rich data source from a nationally recognized institution such as Massachusetts General Hospital should prove invaluable for the applicant’s future career aspirations. For analysis we expect the applicant to take advantage of the wealth of state-of-the-art computational tools currently available, tools such as scientific machine learning, deep learning, denoising diffusion, differentiable programming, or neurosymbolic artificial intelligence. There is a tremendous and as yet untapped opportunity to extract synergy from data, analytics, and a practitioner’s knowledge of clinical medicine. We aim to help the candidate realize this potential to impact patient care.

A candidate’s experience in the lab could lead in a number of future directions, including academia, medical school, or the healthcare industry. Past lab members have successfully pursued all of these directions. Our collective experience straddles all of these environments and we expect to provide mentorship in all aspects of career development. The lab is a fun, friendly, and collaborative environment that values work-life balance. We are located in the MGH Cardiovascular Research Center and are active members of the greater Boston science community including MIT and Harvard.

Requirements

Qualified candidates should have:


A Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics, or biology. Expectations and mentorship will be tailored to the applicant’s training.
Mature coding skills: Python, Julia, or R (Python and/or Julia are preferred).
Proficiency with Machine Learning and/or System Modeling, including libraries such as PyTorch or Flux.
Knowledge of cardiovascular medicine is a plus but not required.
Ability to work independently and collaboratively.
Growth Mindset.


Interested candidates should include a resume or CV as well as a brief cover letter describing their background and interests in their application.
