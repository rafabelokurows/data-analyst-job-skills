Bol is always advancing its platform to create a better tomorrow for over 13 million customers and 50,000 trading partners. Our advertising propositions help shoppers discover products and advertisers reach customers – this is where you’ll make a difference. Data informs decisions, frames conversations, and changes perceptions. You’ll ensure it’s used effectively and responsibly.

The biggest challenge

Advertising via Bol is growing fast and becoming increasingly important. With the rapid expansion of our team, technology, and initiatives, our data needs are no exception. We need meaningful metrics, insightful analyses, and reliable predictive models to keep scaling effectively. This is where you’ll make your mark.

What You’ll Do As a Data Analyst

You’ll join 15 analysts in Bol’s advertising analytics organisation. Together you share a mission of making people performant through analytics. This role is for the versatile analyst who is equally comfortable working with data and engaging with stakeholders. You’ll work with stakeholders to identify high value use cases for analytics, use SQL, Python, and Tableau to then create metrics, do analysis, and make predictions, and support the business in making better decisions.


You work closely with stakeholders (Leadership, Product teams, Sales teams, Operation teams) to gather requirements.
You’re curious and develop deep domain knowledge to create meaningfull language around our data for business stakeholders.
You prioritize, design, and perform analysis and/or dashboards.
You deliver insights and predictions through engaging dashboards and presentations.
You develop extensive domain knowledge to effectively manage and analyse advertising KPIs.
You write high quality and easily interpretable SQL and Python code that can be reused by colleagues and scales easily as data volumes increase.


3 reasons why this is (not) for you Switch to find out


If you strongly value clarity No, if innovating, autonomy, and ambiguity sound terrifying to you.
You only want to process data No, if you only want to process data and prefer someone else to handle project and stakeholder management.
If you believe analysts don’t need domain knowledge No, if you don't want to dive into the world of advertising. Curiosity and willingness to learn about our domain and customers are key to your success.
You’re an analytics professional Yes, if you have 1+ year experience delighting business users with your SQL skills. Python scripting is a strong plus. If you're a recent master's graduate with basic coding skills, feel free to apply
Obsess over building the right things Yes, if you believe output does not equal outcome and judge success by value creation.
You get (and create) energy by working with others Yes, if you can translate technical information into language anyone can understand. You enjoy working with both data and people.


It is our responsibility to enable an environment that unleashes the power of diversity.

About The Job

Do you want to work for a highly successful, fast expanding international retailer with many growth opportunities? At Action we offer you the opportunity to become part of our newly created Strategy and Analytics team as Data Analyst and play an important role in supporting the overall growth of Action.

This is your daily action

The Data Analyst is part of the Business Development Team and reports to the Head of Business Development. Together with senior executives, the Strategy and Analytics team works on key topics for Action such as: Sustainability, Digitization, Expansion, Supply Chain and more. Together with your team members you support in driving data-driven decision-making across the organization.

Your work field is very dynamic, but in general involves tasks such as:


Build deep insights and analysis regarding the dynamic and competitive landscape in which we operate.
Work with our internal data and external market data to discover insights, converting these into tangible business recommendations that support our strategy.
Lead and participate in strategic projects, in close collaboration with your colleagues from the Strategy and Analytics Team and the Action team at large.
Support operational departments in root cause analyses and understanding performance issues


Your work location will be our International Head Office in Zwaagdijk (a 30 minutes traffic free drive from Amsterdam).

This is you

What you bring:


Strong analytical and problem-solving abilities.
Proficiency in data analysis tools such as SQL, Python, R, and data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, or similar.
Familiarity with retail analytics, including sales forecasting, inventory, and customer behavior analysis.
Excellent communication and presentation skills.
Minimum of 2-3 years of experience in data analysis or a related field.
Bachelor’s degree in Data Science, Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Economics, or a related field.


What we offer

Surprisingly much! From our international headquarters in the Netherlands you have an impact on what happens in our stores across Europe. We welcome more than 15 million customers every week in more than 2,600 stores in 12 European countries. We have great growth ambitions. For Action and for you. Because our growth means that you can always take new steps. A different position, an interesting innovation project, new skills: you can continue to develop as a professional. And all this in a culture where our shared values are truly lived: customer focus, teamwork, simplicity, discipline, cost conscious and respect

Did you know that you can also count on us for:


A competitive salary based on a 38-hour working week
24 paid vacation days with the option of purchasing 5 extra days (based on 38 hours per week).
A temporary contract with the intention of offering you a permanent contract in the long term
Flexible working hours
15% employee discount on your purchases at Action
A good pension scheme and collective health insurance


How we contribute to society

If you only know Action from the stores, a world will open up for you when you come and work with us. We work hard to make a positive impact on society and the environment. Did you know, for example, that we sponsor more than 2,500 children worldwide who grow up in an SOS Children's Village? That our team reflects the diversity of our customers, including 155 different nationalities? That we purchase 94% of our wood products and 100% of our cotton sustainably? And that almost all our stores only use energy-efficient LED lighting? Yes, that is also Action. Curious about what other initiatives we’re facilitating? Join our team and find out for yourself.

Interested?

We invite you for a first job interview.

Data, data en nog meer data

Onze klanten hebben en werken met data, veeeeeeeel data. Veel van deze data zit verstopt en blijft hiermee ongebruikt. Best zonde vind je niet? Aan jou om die data uit de krochten van de systemen te trekken en op zoek te gaan naar mogelijkheden om deze data in te zetten om de business (nog) beter te maken. Je gaat als het ware op zoek naar de schatten in deze verzameling aan data. Concreet kan je denken aan het verzamelen en structuren van data, het controleren en het verwerken van data waarbij je deze omzet naar informatie.




Naast dat je onze klanten helpt om meer datagedreven te werken, ga je meebouwen aan onze IT-tak. Beter gezegd, hoe wij onze kennis en expertise op het gebied van data analyse verder kunnen uitbreiden; intern en extern. Met elkaar ga je uitvinden wat jullie willen leren en hoe jullie dit gaan doen. Je neemt hierin de trekkende rol op je en vindt het leuk om onze junioren hierin mee te nemen.







Wie ben jij?

Je vindt het leuk om te werken met grote data sets en het uitvoeren van analyses;
Je hebt ervaring met Python, PowerBI, Azure en/of AWS;
Je houdt van het delen van je kennis, maar wil ook graag nieuwe dingen leren;
Je wilt graag meebouwen aan onze IT start-up;
Je bent op zoek naar een club collega’s waar aandacht, binding en betrokkenheid centraal staat.







Wat krijg je van ons?

Salaris vanaf € 3.526 (o.b.v. 40 uur) afhankelijk van jouw kennis ervaring;
Elektrische leaseauto, opleidingsbudget, team- en samenwerkdagen en andere leuke uitjes;
De mogelijkheid om jezelf verder te ontwikkelen met behulp van o.a. leerpaden, opleidingen en een coach-consultant;
Starten wanneer jij wil, maar hoe eerder, hoe beter.







Great Place To Work

Wéer een keurmerk? Dacht het niet, want een Great Place To Work word je niet zomaar. Sinds 2020 zijn wij een Great Place To Work-Certified en daar zijn wij natuurlijk super trots op! Door deze certificering weten wij dat onze collega’s met trots, plezier en vertrouwen aan ’t werk gaan. Zo vindt 96% van onze collega’s Ciratum alles overziend een Great Place To Work. Middels dit onderzoek weten wij precies wat er speelt. The good and the bad. En dat is oké, want zo kunnen wij dagelijks hard werken aan onze organisatiecultuur. Zo bouwen wij samen verder 🧡.







#samenverder?

Als jouw datahart sneller is gaan kloppen na het lezen van deze vacature, kunnen wij maar één ding zeggen: solliciteer! Heb je toch nog wat vragen? Joëlle beantwoordt ze graag. Ze is te bereiken via werkenbij@ciratum.nl.

Ben jij op zoek naar een nieuwe uitdaging met afwisseling én een goede werk-privébalans? Dan zou Datamo wel eens de plek voor jou kunnen zijn! Bij Datamo haal je het beste uit jezelf door veel kennis en ervaring op te doen bij toonaangevende organisaties. Samen met jou stellen we een persoonlijk ontwikkelplan op, zodat je specifieke expertise kunt opdoen en de gewenste opleidingen kunt volgen.




Ontvang bij Datamo een compleet pakket, zoals een salaris tot € 7.000 bruto per maand, jaarlijks 35 vrij op te nemen dagen, en bepaal zelf hoe je naar je opdrachtgevers reist met behulp van een mobiliteitsbudget, vrij te besteden voor eigen vervoer of een leaseauto (zoals een Tesla Model 3).




De functie

Als Data Consultant bij Datamo krijg je de kans om jouw talenten te benutten en waardevolle ervaring op te doen bij diverse spraakmakende opdrachtgevers als financiële instellingen zoals de ING of overheidsorganisaties zoals ministeries of overige organisaties zoals KLM, NS en nog veel meer. Bij Datamo werk je op projectbasis, van 3 maanden tot 1 jaar, of indien gewenst zelfs langer. Je werkt in diverse rollen, zoals Data Engineer, Data Analyst of Data Scientist, afhankelijk van jouw voorkeur, ervaring en expertise. Voor wat jouw specifieke opdracht betreft zullen wij verschillende keuzes aan je voorleggen. Jij bepaalt uiteindelijk helemaal zelf welke opdracht je gaat uitvoeren, want wij willen niets liever dan dat jij op een plek zit die helemaal bij je past




Jouw taken

Het exacte takenpakket hangt volledig af van de opdracht die je gaat vervullen en natuurlijk ook van de organisatie waarvoor je aan de slag gaat.




Onderstaande taken kun je onder andere verwachten bij verschillende rollen als Data Consultant:

• Data analyseren om belangrijke patronen en trends te ontdekken

• Data Clustering, Data Mining en Data Visualisatie.

• Gesprekspartner zijn voor eindgebruikers om visualisaties optimaal te maken

• Data integreren voor het optimaliseren van analyses.

• Advies verstrekken over het effectief gebruiken van data voor besluitvorming.

• Rapporten opstellen om complexe data inzichtelijk te maken voor collega’s.

• Het ontwikkelen van producten en innovatieve modellen goed laten samengaan met software-oplossingen.




Wie zoeken wij?

Wij zoeken een enthousiaste en leergierige collega die het leuk vindt projectmatig ervaring op te doen in diverse branches, organisaties en functies. Daarnaast:

Heb je minimaal 2 jaar relevante werkervaring.
Ben je in het bezit van een hbo-/wo-diploma.
Ben je in staat goede relaties op te bouwen en te onderhouden met onze opdrachtgevers.
Weet jij wel raad met Python, R, VBA, JavaScript, Power BI (Tableau, Qlik), SQL, Excel en Azure/AWS.
Beschik je over sterke communicatieve vaardigheden.
Heb je een uitstekende beheersing van de Nederlandse taal (schrijven en spreken).




Wat kun je verwachten van Datamo?

Datamo is onderdeel van de grotere ‘Thuis van’-formule, wat betekent dat je onderdeel bent van een grotere organisatie bestaande uit 75 collega’s, die werkzaam zijn bij Datamo (Data Specialisten), Entrador (Business Analisten), Specktor (Product Owners) en Strates (Roostersoftware Specialisten). Onderling delen we kennis en netwerk met elkaar. Allen met dezelfde normen en waarden: het creëren van een thuisgevoel, het beste uit iedereen halen door jou zo goed mogelijk te faciliteren.




Datamo is een platte organisatie, je vindt bij ons geen onnodige directie of managementlagen, maar wel korte communicatielijnen. Jouw potentieel en geluk staan centraal, en wij willen jou daar graag in ondersteunen. Je bent bij ons zeker geen nummer, maar wel een hele belangrijke collega!

En laten we eerlijk zijn, bij Datamo wordt “data crunchen” ineens een stuk gezelliger. We combineren vakinhoudelijke ontwikkeling met sociale activiteiten, zodat je niet alleen groeit in je vakgebied, maar ook in je connecties binnen het team. We organiseren regelmatig groepsactiviteiten waarbij geldt dat je niet moet, maar mag deelnemen!

Last but not least… Bij Datamo is de balans tussen werk en privé erg belangrijk. Niet voor niets geven we je 35 vrij op te nemen dagen per jaar en overwerken staat niet in ons vocabulaire.




Wat bieden wij jou?

Een uitstekend salaris tussen de € 4.500 en € 7.000 bruto per maand bestaande uit een vast en een variabel component;
35 vrij op te nemen dagen per jaar;
Een meer dan goede pensioenregeling;
Mobiliteitsbudget, vrij te besteden voor flexibel zakelijk vervoer: NS, fiets, taxi, Uber, deelauto, je eigen auto etc. en/of te besteden voor een eigen leaseauto.
Een MacBook Air;
Een maandelijkse telefoonvergoeding;
Gezellige uitjes, georganiseerd door en voor Datamo collega’s!
Waardevolle (in-house) trainings- en kennissessies;
Goede opleidingsmogelijkheden, ‘’the sky is the limit’’;
Meerdere interessante bonusregelingen voor bijvoorbeeld het aandragen van nieuwe collega’s.
Een fijne werkplek in ons monumentale pand in het centrum van het mooie Amersfoort.




Enthousiast geworden?

Klaar voor een nieuwe uitdaging? Solliciteer nu en haal alles uit jouw carrière met interessante projecten en kansen om je vaardigheden te ontwikkelen!

The Data Analyst is part of the Business Development Team and reports to the Head of Business Development. Together with senior executives, the Strategy and Analytics team works on key topics for Action such as: Sustainability, Digitization, Expansion, Supply Chain and more. Together with your team members you support in driving data-driven decision-making across the organization.

Build deep insights and analysis regarding the dynamic and competitive landscape in which we operate.
Work with our internal data and external market data to discover insights, converting these into tangible business recommendations that support our strategy.
Lead and participate in strategic projects, in close collaboration with your colleagues from the Strategy and Analytics Team and the Action team at large.
Support operational departments in root cause analyses and understanding performance issues


Your work location will be our International Head Office in Zwaagdijk (a 30 minutes traffic free drive from Amsterdam).

This is you

What you bring:


Strong analytical and problem-solving abilities.
Proficiency in data analysis tools such as SQL, Python, R, and data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, or similar.
Familiarity with retail analytics, including sales forecasting, inventory, and customer behavior analysis.
Excellent communication and presentation skills.
Minimum of 2-3 years of experience in data analysis or a related field.
Bachelor’s degree in Data Science, Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Economics, or a related field.


What we offer

Surprisingly much! From our international headquarters in the Netherlands you have an impact on what happens in our stores across Europe. We welcome more than 15 million customers every week in more than 2,600 stores in 12 European countries. We have great growth ambitions. For Action and for you. Because our growth means that you can always take new steps. A different position, an interesting innovation project, new skills: you can continue to develop as a professional. And all this in a culture where our shared values are truly lived: customer focus, teamwork, simplicity, discipline, cost conscious and respect

Did you know that you can also count on us for:


A competitive salary based on a 38-hour working week
24 paid vacation days with the option of purchasing 5 extra days (based on 38 hours per week).
A temporary contract with the intention of offering you a permanent contract in the long term
Flexible working hours
15% employee discount on your purchases at Action
A good pension scheme and collective health insurance


How we contribute to society

If you only know Action from the stores, a world will open up for you when you come and work with us. We work hard to make a positive impact on society and the environment. Did you know, for example, that we sponsor more than 2,500 children worldwide who grow up in an SOS Children's Village? That our team reflects the diversity of our customers, including 155 different nationalities? That we purchase 94% of our wood products and 100% of our cotton sustainably? And that almost all our stores only use energy-efficient LED lighting? Yes, that is also Action. Curious about what other initiatives we’re facilitating? Join our team and find out for yourself.

Totaal telt deze organisatie internationaal ca. 2000 werknemers waarvan ze met ca. 700 man op het hoofdkantoor in Hilversum zitten. Ondanks dit aantal streven ze ernaar om het van ouds familiegevoel te behouden. Het is een fijne platte organisatie waar iedereen benaderbaar is en veel activiteiten worden georganiseerd buiten werktijd om. Ze hebben meer dan 2,5 miljoen klanten en zijn de onbetwiste marktleider in online verkoop van hun producten. Sinds de oprichting van de online webshop in 2000 zijn ze uitgegroeid tot een van de snelst groeiende en meest succesvolle webwinkels in Nederland, en ze blijven nog steeds sterk groeien.







Functie:




Je focust je hierbij niet alleen op de hoofdwebshop maar ook op alle andere webshops wereldwijd. De vraag naar inzichtelijke data wordt steeds groter en belangrijker voor het maken van beslissingen. Daarom is het belangrijk als data analist dat je de juiste data uit de SQL database en deze weer omzet in een duidelijke rapportage. Hiervoor gebruiken ze PowerbI. Het is belangrijk dat jij met je scherpe analytische blik een duidelijk overzicht kan creëren en de verschillende afdelingen binnen de organisatie kan adviseren. Ook dit om processen beter te automatiseren en zodat ze slimmer en efficiënter te werk kunnen gaan. Gedetailleerde en goed onderbouwde rapporten bieden waardevolle ondersteuning bij het nemen van belangrijke beslissingen.

Het data team is van zichzelf een zelfstandige afdeling maar je werkt nauw samen met andere afdelingen en er is veel onderling contact. Samen met het team van momenteel 5 andere data analisten ga je te werk om met oplossingen voor de organisatie te komen door middel van het maken van dashboards maar ook door het bedenken van andere interessante dingen.







Eisen:




Minimaal afgeronde HBO (bij voorkeur economische kant)
Minimaal 2 jaar ervaring als Data Analist
Ervaring met SQL en PowerBI
Vloeiend zijn in Nederlands en Engels







Aanbod:




Salarisindicatie tussen de €3.100 en €4.500,- bruto per maand
25 vakantiedagen
Mogelijkheid tot thuiswerken (40/60)
Trainingsbudget
Reiskostenvergoeding
Flexibele werktijden

Het is belangrijk dat jij met je scherpe analytische blik een duidelijk overzicht kan creëren en de verschillende afdelingen binnen de organisatie kan adviseren.

Word je enthousiast van data-uniformering en -harmonisering? Bij Milgro werken we aan een dataplatform in de Microsoft Azure cloud. Jij gaat vanuit jouw bestaande kennis en ervaring meedenken hoe deze technische vernieuwing eruit moet gaan zien. Wij zijn Milgro, hét technologiebedrijf voor het managen van natuurlijk kapitaal. En we zijn per direct op zoek naar een enthousiaste collega die ons team komt versterken als junior Data Engineer.




Wat ga je doen?

Werkzaamheden




Als junior Data Engineer heb je een afwisselende baan. Je ontsluit data uit verschillende systemen, schoont het op indien nodig, schrijft transformaties in T-SQL, en stelt de informatie als model beschikbaar voor de eindgebruiker.




Op dit moment is de uitdaging om zowel externe- als interne data uit verschillende bronnen te harmoniseren tot één waarheid. Milgro heeft veel aandacht voor Data Governance; jij zal hier, als Data Engineer, ook een grote rol in spelen. Hierbij kun je denken aan onderwerpen als datakwaliteit en eigenaarschap.




Als Data Engineer word je onderdeel van het team Data & Technology binnen de afdeling IT; een multidisciplinair team dat werkt volgens de Agile-methodiek. Je werkt aan het datafundament voor Milgro Data Services en maakt gebruik van de nieuwe technieken en tools.




Je krijgt de ruimte om tijdens de sprintplanning aan te geven waar jij graag aandacht aan besteed: van data uitsluiten met Data Factory, tot het visualiseren in Power BI of zelfs voorspellingen doen met Machine Learning.




Je werkt nauw samen met andere IT-teams, eindgebruikers en data-eigenaren om de databehoeftes en -functionaliteiten van het ecosysteem goed te begrijpen en te vertalen naar oplossingen voor de markt.




De ideale kandidaat:

Beschikt minimaal over HBO werk- en denkniveau.
Heeft kennis en ervaring met SQL databases
Heeft ervaring met het ontsluiten van verschillende databronnen
Ervaring met BI-dataplatformen in Microsoft Azure is een pré
Is data-minded, analytisch en creatief
Heeft de voorkeur voor werken volgens Agile/Scrum-methodiek
Beschikt over goede communicatieve vaardigheden en beheerst de Nederlandse taal goed in woord en geschrift







Wat kan je van ons verwachten?

Een uitdagende baan waarbij je werkzaam bent in ons kantoor in Rotterdam;
Hybride werken: een goede balans tussen thuis en op kantoor werken;
Ontwikkeling op persoonlijk en professioneel vlak
Begeleiding door ervaren IT professionals
Aantrekkelijke arbeidsvoorwaarden

About Business Unit

IBM Software infuses core business operations with intelligence—from machine learning to generative AI—to help make organizations more responsive, productive, and resilient. IBM Software helps clients put AI into action now to create real value with trust, speed, and confidence across digital labor, IT automation, application modernization, security, and sustainability. Critical to this is the ability to make use of all data, because AI is only as good as the data that fuels it. In most organizations data is spread across multiple clouds, on premises, in private datacenters, and at the edge. IBM’s AI and data platform scales and accelerates the impact of AI with trusted data, and provides leading capabilities to train, tune and deploy AI across business. IBM’s hybrid cloud platform is one of the most comprehensive and consistent approach to development, security, and operations across hybrid environments—a flexible foundation for leveraging data, wherever it resides, to extend AI deep into a business.

In der Abteilung TT/S15 erforschen und entwickeln wir die nächste Generation von Elektrik/Elektronik-Architekturen (kurz „E/E“) bei Daimler Truck. Dabei ist der Wandel von der Komponenten-orientierten zur Software-definierten und Service-orientierten E/E-Architektur der Fokus unserer Tätigkeiten. Neue Kund:innenwünsche sowie das autonome Fahren sollen mit der neuen E/E-Architektur ermöglicht werden. Diese Kund:innenlösungen müssen mit schnellen Time-to-Market Anforderungen verfügbar sein.

Um die Entwicklung solch einer Software-definierten E/E-Architektur methodisch zu unterstützen, richtet sich Daimler Truck nach modellbasierter Entwicklung mit Systems Engineering Gesichtspunkten (MBSE). Die Umstellung des gesamten Entwicklungsprozesses auf die modellbasierte Entwicklung mit der Einführung des Systemgedanken stellt dabei eine große Herausforderung dar, die unsere Abteilung durch die Definition von Methoden, Rollen und Arbeitspaketen im Systems Engineering sowie dem Support angeht. Gerade die Erstellung der Modelle auf verschiedenen Abstraktionsebenen (Von logischer Architektur über System- bis hin zur Hardware-Architektur) sowie die Definition der Schnittstellen zwischen den Ebenen ist essenziell für die erfolgreiche Etablierung von MBSE in unserem Unternehmen. Es gilt daher, die verschiedenen Abstraktionsebenen von Modellen in unseren Systems Engineering Ansatz zu integrieren, um alle Vorteile von dynamischen Interfaces in einer Modelllandschaft nutzen zu können.

Werden Sie ein Teil der Innovation bei Daimler Truck und arbeiten Sie mit Ihrer Abschlussarbeit an spannenden Themen der Zukunft mit!

Diese Herausforderungen kommen auf Sie zu:


Aufarbeitung von Stand der Technik und Wissenschaft
Einarbeitung in die Welt von Elektrik/Elektronik-Architekturen bei Daimler Truck
Einarbeitung in existierende Systems Engineering-Entwicklungsmethoden bei Daimler Truck
Entwicklung eines Konzepts für die Einführung von Feature- und Systemmodellen auf verschiedenen Abstraktionsebenen samt Interfaces zwischen den Ebenen
Erarbeitung einer Argumentation für die Notwendigkeit der Einführung von Feature- und Systemmodellen
Prototypische Umsetzung des Konzepts in einem modellbasierten Werkzeug mit Produktivdaten
Dokumentation und Präsentation der Ergebnisse


Die endgültige Themenfindung erfolgt in Absprache mit der Hochschule, Ihnen und uns. Möglichkeiten der Betreuung über den Lehrstuhl „Mobilität und Technik“ der Hochschule Esslingen sind vorhanden.

Qualifikationen


Naturwissenschaftlicher Studiengang (Elektrotechnik, Informatik, Wirtschaftsingenieurwesen, Maschinenbau oder Vergleichbares), idealerweise im Master
Sichere Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse in Wort und Schrift
Sicherer Umgang mit MS-Office
Engagement und Teamfähigkeit
Analytische Denkweise und strategische Arbeitsweise


Zusätzliche Informationen:

Ganz ohne Formalitäten geht es natürlich auch bei uns nicht. Daher bitten wir Sie, sich ausschließlich online zu bewerben und Ihrer Bewerbung einen Lebenslauf, aktuelle Immatrikulationsbescheinigung, aktuellen Notenspiegel und relevante Zeugnisse (max. Gesamtgröße der Anhänge 5 MB) beizufügen.

Bitte haben Sie Verständnis dafür, dass wir keine Papierbewerbungen mehr entgegennehmen und es keinen Anspruch auf Rückversand gibt.

Weiterführende Informationen zu den Einstellkriterien finden Sie hier. Angehörige von Staaten außerhalb des europäischen Wirtschaftsraums schicken ggf. bitte ihre Aufenthalts-/Arbeitsgenehmigung mit.

Wir freuen uns insbesondere über Onlinebewerbungen schwerbehinderter und ihnen gleichgestellter behinderter Menschen.

Du verfügst über erste Berufserfahrungen im Bereich Transaktionsberatung oder Unternehmensbewertung.
Du kannst dich für Themen rund um Unternehmensbewertung, Accounting, Controlling oder Finance sowie Themen wie Interpreneurship und strategische Unternehmensführung begeistern und hast Interesse an Financial Modelling.
Du hast Lust aktuelle Trendthemen wie Digitalisierung und Nachhaltigkeit in der Projektarbeit weiterzuentwickeln sowie dich in neue Geschäftsmodelle einzudenken.

Dabei gibt es keine Kernarbeitszeiten und du hast die Möglichkeit, im Home Office sowie in über 40 Ländern zu arbeiten.

Masterförderung – Durch unsere interne Academy, internationale Erfahrungen durch Secondments und kontinuierliches Mentoring entwickelst du dich stetig weiter. Darüber hinaus bieten wir die Möglichkeit einer Masterförderung für Examensmaster und Spezialisierungsmaster an.

Freizeit – Dank eines Teilzeit-Blockmodells kannst du auch mehrmonatige Auszeiten in Form eines Sabbaticals nehmen. Zusätzlich kannst du bei PwC Deutschland Überstunden auf einem persönlichen Jahresarbeitszeitkonto sammeln. Dabei bleibt es dir überlassen, ob du dir deine Überstunden auszahlen lässt oder flexibel in mehr Freizeit umwandelst.

Gesundheit – Deine Gesundheit liegt uns am Herzen: Neben einer eigenen betrieblichen Krankenkasse bieten wir auch Vorsorgeuntersuchungen sowie Sportangebote an.

Hos oss arbetar du med de ledande affärssystemen från SAP och Microsoft, utvalda best-of-breed lösningar, och det senaste inom intelligent digitalisering, analytics och cloud. Implema ligger i framkant av digitaliseringsvågen, vilket kräver att vi vågar tänka nytt och tänja på gränser. Vi är prestigelösa, öppna och hjälpsamma – både internt och med våra kunder. Idag är vi drygt 200 anställda och finns på 10 orter runtom i landet.

Om rollen

Implema söker nu efter fler konsulter med spetskompetens inom Power BI. Hos oss kommer du få jobba med spännande kunder i korta projekt, alltid i team, och bidra till ett svenskt näringsliv i världsklass! Som analytics-konsult kommer du primärt att ansvara för att samla in, strukturera och visualisera data från olika källor. På Implema använder vi den senaste tekniken inom planering, simulering och affärsanalys, vilket är helt avgörande för att mäta och styra verksamheter till framgång. 

Exempel på arbetsuppgifter kommer vara:

Jobba med utveckling, implementering och underhåll av analyticslösningar baserat på Microsoft analytics
Tillgängliggöra data och skapa rapporter
Workshopfacilitering för kunder och kollegor
Support och rådgivning till befintliga kunder vid frågor, fel och vidareutveckling

Du kommer att ingå i ett mindre team och därav få möjlighet att växla mellan operativt, taktiskt och strategiskt arbete. Allt i en delikat blandning! Eftersom såväl kompetens som erbjudande ska fortsätta att utvecklas inom området kommer du få vara med och skapa det klimat och de implementationer som Implema beger sig in på.  

Är du vår nya kollega?

För att lyckas i rollen som analytics-konsult inom Power BI ser vi att du har:

Minst 3 års erfarenhet inom analysverktyget Power BI (DAX-kod, data modellering, rapport- och dashboarddesign)
Erfarenhet av projektarbete, konsultation och teknisk problemlösning. Kanske har du tidigare jobbat som konsult eller på verksamhets-/kundsidan där du skaffat dig praktiskt erfarenhet av någon av dom större affärssystemen (Microsoft Dynamics 365, SAP, IFS, M3, NetSuite, Monitor, Jeeves eller liknande)
Goda kunskaper inom SQL
Goda kunskaper i svenska och engelska 

Meriterande om du har kunskap om andra BI-verktyg som Qlik eller Tableau samt om du har erfarenhet om Azure-plattformen och Microsoft Fabric. Vidare tror vi du har ett stort intresse för analytics/business intelligence och hur detta kan bidra till att stärka våra kunders konkurrenskraft. Du uppskattar att jobba nära beslutsfattare och har förmåga att få saker att hända. Du är också en dedikerad lagspelare som värnar om högkvalitativa leveranser. 


Vad vi erbjuder dig

Välkommen in i en dynamisk organisation med en kultur och ett engagemang som kännetecknas av en stolthet och stark vilja att alltid driva arbetet framåt. Vi lovar dig en utmanande och varierande roll där du har möjlighet att både växa och vara med och påverka. Om du, precis som vi, är nyfiken på ny teknik och uppskattar att arbeta med tekniska lösningar som ligger i absolut framkant så kommer du att trivas hos oss!


Arbetsglädje, kreativitet och personlig utveckling börjar med god hälsa och att du mår bra. Därför eftersträvar vi att tillsammans med dig säkerställa en hållbar balans mellan arbete och fritid i din tillvaro. För oss är det minst lika viktigt som att erbjuda alla våra anställda jobb i en god, hållbar arbetsmiljö med marknadsmässiga löner och förmåner.

Built by some of the world’s most driven founders and operators, our distributed team operates on the ground in Stockholm, London, New York, Berlin, and Paris.




Currently investing out of a €1.1B fund, the largest early-stage fund ever raised in Europe, we’re one of the most active VC firms globally and have partnered with over 100 founding teams, including Wolt, Einride, Handshake, The Exploration Company, Sana Labs, 1x Robotics, and Cleo.




About the Role

Join our newly formed AI team as a Quantitative Analyst, and play a pivotal role in extending EQT’s leadership in AI-driven VC. Our systems help us discover the most ambitious entrepreneurs earlier, and support them in solving the world’s most pressing problems by harnessing the full potential of EQT’s global network and technology initiatives. The startup landscape moves faster than any other industry, and our AI team thrives on speed and rapid iteration to solve problems effectively.




As a Quantitative Analyst, you’ll uncover insights from vast sets of public, commercial and proprietary data, build a deep understanding of new markets and emerging technologies, and build models that automate key parts of our investment process. You’ll collaborate with all investment teams at EQT Ventures, ensuring insights drive action and empowering us to make quicker, data-driven decisions.




Key responsibilities

Sourcing great investment opportunities by training algorithms and using innovative analysis on a mix of public, commercial and proprietary data, building systems to make this process repeatable and scalable.
Develop predictive models that quantify market signals, company traction metrics, and community sentiment to identify startups with outlier founders working on breakthrough technology.
Continually assess and integrate state-of-the-art technology, tools and practices, keeping our team at the forefront of the industry and maintaining EQT’s competitive edge.
Collaborate with Investors, Analysts and Operational Support at EQT Ventures – assessing internal EQT data sources as well as external data troves, making sure we have the right insights at the right time.
Build internal “special projects” where algorithms, technology and data drive portfolio and team efficiency, performance and productivity.




About you

This role demands a technical and entrepreneurial mindset, a relentless pursuit of excellence, and a deep passion for data and analytics. You should have a strong interest in startups, investments, new technologies, entrepreneurship, and a love for AI.




We believe that you have a tinkering mindset, an urge to build innovative solutions, and that you like to optimize for velocity, while constantly learning in an intellectually stimulating and challenging environment.




Mindset & traits

Techno-Optimist: firmly held belief in technology’s ability to transform society for the better, and committed to pushing the boundaries of VC to accelerate progress.
Gets Shit Done: turn plans into action and ideas into reality, efficiently and with flair; facing a locked door, you either kick it down, learn how to pick locks, or find a window.
Compulsive Maker: possess a hands-on mentality, probably tinkering with new AI tools and personal projects in your spare time, and always trying new things.
Maths & Stats Aficionado: you hold a deep love for mathematical modeling, statistical analysis and their applications on real-world data. It wouldn’t surprise us if you have a framed picture of Gauss, Euler or Feynman on your wall.
Super Communicator: can understand, distill and explain complex ideas to a layman. You like the idea of creating a presentation for executive MBAs on topics like LLMs, quantum statistics or loss functions.




Tech & tools we love (and that can help you thrive in the role)

Programming: Python, Javascript
Tabular data: Pandas, Google sheets
Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Scikit-Learn, xgboost, pytorch, keras
Visualization: Streamlit, plotly
SQL & Big Data: dbt, BigQuery, Spark, duckdb
AI Tools: Llamaindex, Pinecone, Anyscale, Weights & Biases, Kubeflow




Join us now on our mission to revolutionize how data and AI is being used in early stage VC!




EQT Ventures is working together with Safemind as an exclusive partner to manage this recruitment process.

Would you like to help Nordea drive customer-centric decision making? We are looking for a senior customer insight analyst with a flair for behavioural data and data analysis to support us in delivering some of the major customer satisfaction surveys at Nordea.

 

We are creating a work environment where we develop and adapt to what we observe, in order to keep the customer voice at the core of the business and grow together. To help with this objective, we need your ideas and unique background!

 

At Nordea, we see that the world is changing fast – and we want to help our customers to succeed by providing them with the financial solutions of tomorrow. 

 

About this opportunity:

Welcome to Customer Behavioural Insights, a truly Nordic team working across all four Scandinavian countries to deliver strategic customer insights based on both qualitative and quantitative methods, often in collaboration. We support internal departments ranging from strategic marketing, communication and branding, to business development, service- and product- strategy teams. The team is responsible for delivering overall key performance indicators of customer satisfaction at Nordea, together with other satisfaction measures such as brand perception. 

 

What you’ll be doing:

Support our team in delivering existing recurring customer surveys
Implement and test surveys in our survey tool
Continuously improve existing processes, methods and data outputs
Transform your findings into tangible business insights and simple, to the point visualizations
Communicate and present your insights to key stakeholders

You’ll join a team driven by curiosity and exploration, with team members from a broad range of academic backgrounds. All of us have a keen interest in learning new methods and to build upon each other’s areas of specialization. The position is based in Helsinki or Stockholm. 

 

Who you are:

Collaboration. Ownership. Passion. Courage. These are the values that guide us in being at our best – and that we imagine you share with us.

 

To succeed in this role, we believe that you:

Are more interested in what the numbers tell you than the numbers themselves. You have a sense for how to translate large data sets into actionable insights. Can think both analytically and intuitively to uncover user needs
Have a technical and mathematical mindset with attention to detail but do not lose focus on the overall goals
Are naturally curious and efficient minded, and whilst being meticulous you also constantly search for ways to improve processes and deliveries
Like to collaborate with others and thrive on feedback and continuous improvement
Build relations professionally across the organisation to improve your own work

Your experience and background:

Proven track record and experience working with quantitative research methods, including conducting and analysing surveys
Hands-on knowledge in applying data science and statistical methods to survey data - prior work with sampling and weighting methods is a plus
Working knowledge with statistical tools, especially R and/or willingness to learn R
Experience with content analysis of open comments is an advantage
Experience with presenting and communicating results to diverse audiences
Experience using Qualtrics is an advantage 
Fluency in one local Nordic language is also an advantage

 

 If this sounds like you, get in touch!

Most companies ramble on about purpose and making the world a better place. And pretty often it feels a bit… well, forced. But we’d like to think that our story is special for real.




Our founders, Shadi Bitar and Ninos Malki, came to Sweden from Syria when they were kids. Books became their compass, guiding them through the maze of life, and helping them shape their destinies in a new world.




Their dream was bold: What if they could unlock the world of books for everyone, making knowledge and inspiration accessible to all? Fast forward a few years, and the tale of Nextory was born.




At Nextory, we've crafted a revolutionary monthly subscription that empowers our users to devour books like never before, be it through reading or listening. It's not just a product; it's a passport to endless adventure and enlightenment.




And now, we're on a quest to find a Data Engineer, someone as passionate as we are about making the world a happier place and enriching lives through the world of reading. Join our extraordinary team, and let's script a future where every day is a chapter of discovery, and every book is a key to a richer life.




WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING

As a Data Engineer at Nextory you will work with keeping and developing the data drivenness of Nextotry throughout the organization. With a curious, innovative and analytical mindset and tech-savvy approach you will fuel our data-driven teams.




Together with the team you will be responsible for data services which means, data warehousing, ML/AI, data quality and enabling data insights. You will build and run data pipelines, data warehouses, data frameworks and leverage ML/AI. We believe that you enjoy working autonomously in close collaboration with the cross-functional teams and other stakeholders.




You will be a part of an amazing team and be at the core of understanding a consumer subscription service - always with the continuous aspiration to increase reading! The position is based in Stockholm and you report to our COO.




WHO YOU ARE

We believe that you are currently working in a similar role at a fast-moving company. We believe that you would like to develop a thorough understanding of how consumers use our service and be part of delivering key insights. By using various development techniques, you will keep us in the forefront of creating the best customer experience as well as providing a great self-service data platform. We believe that you take pride in structuring, integrating and transforming data on a daily basis - you believe that data quality is key!

If you have ambitions (or experience!) of working with areas like ML and AI we would love to give you a platform to show your practice! You thrive working in a dynamic and unpretentious environment where you take great responsibility for our product and your team!




SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS

• We believe you have, for the field, relevant educational background

• We believe you have around 4 years of experience from working within the field

• We believe that you are an expert in SQL and have worked with Java, Python and/or similar languages

• We believe that you have experience with cloud infrastructure (Azure, AWS, GCP) and cloud data warehousing, preferably BigQuery or equivalent

• We believe that you have experience working with pipelines and data integration solutions with an ELT approach

• We believe that you have experience in operating, maintaining and ensuring quality of production grade software




We are looking forward to your application which should include a CV or LinkedIn profile.

Påverka arkitektur, teknikval och processer
Bygga kvalitativa högpresterande datapipelines


Är du nyfiken på hur den här texten ska sluta? Kul! Vi gillar dig redan. Att vara nyfiken är viktigt för oss.

På SBAB spelar nämligen rollen mindre roll. Att du är kunnig förväntar vi oss. Det viktiga är att du vill vara med och bidra till vår kultur, attityd och vårt sätt att vara. Och eftersom vi är lika många experter som medarbetare, behöver alla vara just nyfikna och intresserade av varandras olikheter. Vi lyssnar in och omvärderar kontinuerligt. Vi tror på mångfald, att olika perspektiv berikar och att du är en viktig framgångsfaktor. Fortfarande nyfiken? Välkommen!

Att jobba som Data engineer

SBAB söker en Data Engineer som tycker om att koda i Python och har ett stort intresse för dataflöden och automatisering. Du trivs med att utveckla högkvalitativ och högpresterande kod med återanvändbara komponenter. Du tycker om det agila arbetssättet och gillar att arbeta tillsammans genom MOB- eller parprogrammering.

Du kommer att jobba på Data Science-avdelningen på SBAB och höra hemma i ett av avdelningens flera agila och prestigelösa team. Vi har en hybridlösning för vårt analysdata där vi jobbar både med cloud- och on-prem-miljöer med en hög grad av automatisering och DevOps-funktionalitet. Vi har en teknisk roadmap och en vision som vi vill ha din hjälp att utveckla och nå.

Blir du glad av att jobba med följande kommer du att trivas:


Python och SQL
Data-lagring (t.ex.i en Delta-lake)
Pipelines från t.ex. Kafka, API, externa- och tabulära källor
Hackdays


Har du även erfarenhet eller intresse av data virtualisering eller har du redan varit i kontakt med mikrotjänster, så är det en bonus. Du är en orädd person som gillar att experimentera och ta initiativ utanför din hemmaarena. Du bör vara flexibel när det kommer till verktyg, och vara öppen för att använda de komponenter som passar det specifika uppdraget. Vi ser gärna att du kan kommunicera väl på svenska i tal och skrift.

Nu är det semestertider! Vänligen notera att återkoppling kan dröja längre än vanligt.

Har du check på allt?

Vi värmer över 800 000 stockholmare och vårt 300 mil långa fjärrvärmenät är navet för de samhällsnyttor som vi skapar. Vi planerar att bygga en anläggning för koldioxidinfångning vid vårt biokraftvärmeverk i Värtan med potential att fånga in 800 000 ton koldioxid per år, vilket är mer än Stockholms vägtrafik släpper ut under samma period.

Vi behöver fler duktiga medarbetare och hoppas att du vill vara med oss på vår Exergiresa.

Vad kan vi erbjuda dig?

Som Data Engineer i vårt team hanterar du tillsammans med dina kollegor helheten runt Data & Analytics på Stockholm Exergi.

Vi söker dig som vill ha en nyckelroll i att skapa automatiserade arbetsflöden och pipelines för att hämta, organisera och transformera data från olika källor. Vi är idagsläget i ett stadie där vi utvecklar och etablerar en ny dataplattform på MS Azure och Databricks.Som en del av teamet inom Data & Analytics skapar du förutsättningar för dataanalytiker och maskininlärningsingenjörer att bygga stabila analyslösningar- genom att se till att data finns på rätt plats, i rätt format och i rätt tid, korrekt modellerad och tillgängligt i bland annat Power BI. För den här rollen ser vi att du har god teknisk erfarenhet i dataplattformar, liksom en vana att hantera affärskrav och kommunicera med användare.

Rollen är en tillsvidareanställning och har sin utgångspunkt i Hjorthagen, Stockholm. Möjlighet till viss distansarbete finns.

Varför jobba med mig?

Jag tycker om att arbeta på Stockholm Exergi och vill vara med i arbetet mot en hållbar stad. Min prioritet är att det ska kännas schysst att gå till jobbet och att alla får möjlighet att vara den bästa versionen av sig själva. Som person är jag engagerad, transparent och brinner för att få saker gjorda. Jag tror på att arbeta tillsammans, vara prestigelös och se till allas bästa. Tillsammans strävar vi efter att inte bara uppnå höga prestationer utan också att säkerställa ett hållbart arbetsliv för alla.

Jag uppskattar att arbeta med personer som är lösningsorienterade, organiserade, kommunikativa och positiva.

Vi värmer över 800 000 stockholmare och vårt 300 mil långa fjärrvärmenät är navet för de samhällsnyttor som vi skapar. Vi planerar att bygga en anläggning för koldioxidinfångning vid vårt biokraftvärmeverk i Värtan med potential att fånga in 800 000 ton koldioxid per år, vilket är mer än Stockholms vägtrafik släpper ut under samma period.

Vi behöver fler duktiga medarbetare och hoppas att du vill vara med oss på vår Exergiresa.

Vad kan vi erbjuda dig?

Som Data Engineer i vårt team hanterar du tillsammans med dina kollegor helheten runt Data & Analytics på Stockholm Exergi. Vi letar efter dig som lockas av idén att jobba med modern teknologi och att skapa bestående värden för våra intressenter. Vi söker dig som vill ha en nyckelroll i att skapa automatiserade arbetsflöden och pipelines för att hämta, organisera och transformera data från olika källor. Vi är idagsläget i ett stadie där vi utvecklar och etablerar en ny dataplattform på MS Azure och Databricks.Som en del av teamet inom Data & Analytics skapar du förutsättningar för dataanalytiker och maskininlärningsingenjörer att bygga stabila analyslösningar- genom att se till att data finns på rätt plats, i rätt format och i rätt tid, korrekt modellerad och tillgängligt i bland annat Power BI. För den här rollen ser vi att du har god teknisk erfarenhet i dataplattformar, liksom en vana att hantera affärskrav och kommunicera med användare.

Rollen är en tillsvidareanställning och har sin utgångspunkt i Hjorthagen, Stockholm. Möjlighet till viss distansarbete finns.

Varför jobba med mig?

Jag tycker om att arbeta på Stockholm Exergi och vill vara med i arbetet mot en hållbar stad. Min prioritet är att det ska kännas schysst att gå till jobbet och att alla får möjlighet att vara den bästa versionen av sig själva. Som person är jag engagerad, transparent och brinner för att få saker gjorda. Jag tror på att arbeta tillsammans, vara prestigelös och se till allas bästa. Tillsammans strävar vi efter att inte bara uppnå höga prestationer utan också att säkerställa ett hållbart arbetsliv för alla.

Jag uppskattar att arbeta med personer som är lösningsorienterade, organiserade, kommunikativa och positiva.

Annika Wallgren, Head of Business Solutions

At Travelex, data is at the heart of our relationship with our customers. We analyse data in order to understand what our customers prefer and how our products perform. Our work is fast-paced although our team remains collaborative and flexible even when delivering fast.

Your role as data analyst will be to run a wide range of queries on our datasets, interpret the results, and communicate your findings to colleagues and stakeholders. You will be working with product owners, subject matter experts, managers and engineers across the company to develop deep insight on our customers and products.

You will have an end-to-end responsibility for your deliverables: from leading the work to agree the right approach, through developing, running and continuously refining your queries, all the way to presenting your results and recommending what the business should do about them. You will have significant impact on the way our business evolves, and a high level of freedom to do things in your own way.




Responsibilities

Here are key things you’ll do as a data analyst in our team. The list isn’t complete: as a competent analyst, you’ll bring to Travelex your own ideas of what else is needed to become a world-class data-driven business.

Work with colleagues to understand their analytical needs and convert these into robust analytical tasks
Explore data in a range of business domains, such as: retail customer behaviour; online customer behaviour; payment cards; product performance; colleague performance; HR; finance, cost and pricing
Analyse data to understand trends, gaps and anomalies
Build time series, models and forecasts
Compare the performance of products, campaigns and sales across the different geographies where Travelex operates
Help automate analytical tasks so that powerful analytics can come with little effort
Present your findings in a simple, compelling and inspiring way
Develop visualisations and infographics that will shed light on complex business questions
Derive metrics from data and build the processes to monitor these metrics over time
Have particular responsibility for data quality: defining it, monitoring it and improving it




Key Requirements

This vacancy is for someone who greatly enjoys problem-solving, simplifying complex data into simple insight, and continuous learning. Below are key requirements from our data analyst, but you don’t need to tick every box: success in our team comes in many forms!

Competent in analysing data using SQL and Python
Familiar with AWS, including databases, data services and analytics capabilities
Experienced with SageMaker
Capable of creating engaging visualisations and infographics
A strong storyteller, who can turn a big pile of numbers into an interesting narrative
Self-starter and independent, able to turn loosely-defined requirements into concrete deliverables by asking questions, taking initiative and recommending a way forward
A good team player, who enjoys brainstorming and engaging, and is able to resolve differences of opinion in a constructive way
Understands the foundations of information security and data protection
Able to learn new tools, languages and methods quickly
Have the curiosity to understand the business, its requirements and culture
Knowledge of visualisation tools (e.g. Amazon QuickSight) and data modelling techniques isn’t essential but would be an advantage
Familiarity with DBT would be an advantage
Experience of building machine learning models, and familiarity with the common ML libraries in Python, would be an advantage
Your own unique style or way of working, which will make our team diverse and original




Why Travelex?

To remain the world’s leading Foreign Exchange specialist, we focus on making our customers’ lives hassle-free while they travel.

We are customer-centric and innovative. Our digital and data products are part of our investment in the future of Foreign Exchange, cross-border e-commerce and international payments.
