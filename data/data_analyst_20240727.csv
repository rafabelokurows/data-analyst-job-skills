About TikTok U.S. Data Security
TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. U.S. Data Security (“USDS”) is a subsidiary of TikTok in the U.S. This new, security-first division was created to bring heightened focus and governance to our data protection policies and content assurance protocols to keep U.S. users safe. Our focus is on providing oversight and protection of the TikTok platform and U.S. user data, so millions of Americans can continue turning to TikTok to learn something new, earn a living, express themselves creatively, or be entertained. The teams within USDS that deliver on this commitment daily span across Trust & Safety, Security & Privacy, Engineering, User & Product Ops, Corporate Functions and more.

Why Join Us
Creation is the core of TikTok's purpose. Our platform is built to help imaginations thrive. This is doubly true of the teams that make TikTok possible.
Together, we inspire creativity and bring joy - a mission we all believe in and aim towards achieving every day.
To us, every challenge, no matter how difficult, is an opportunity; to learn, to innovate, and to grow as one team. Status quo? Never. Courage? Always.
At TikTok, we create together and grow together. That's how we drive impact - for ourselves, our company, and the communities we serve.

The USDS-Platform and Community Integrity (PaCI) team is missioned to: - Protect U.S. TikTok users, including and beyond content consumers, creators, and advertisers; - Secure platform health and community experience authenticity; - Build infrastructures, platforms, and technologies, as well as to collaborate with many cross-functional teams and stakeholders.

The work needs to be fast, transferrable, while still down to the ground to make quick and solid differences.

Our focus is on providing oversight and protection of the TikTok platform and U.S. user data, so millions of Americans can continue turning to TikTok to learn something new, earn a living, express themselves creatively, or be entertained. The teams within USDS that deliver on this commitment daily span across Trust & Safety, Security & Privacy, Engineering, User & Product Ops, Corporate Functions and more.

Why Join Us
Creation is the core of TikTok's purpose. Our platform is built to help imaginations thrive. This is doubly true of the teams that make TikTok possible.
Together, we inspire creativity and bring joy - a mission we all believe in and aim towards achieving every day.
To us, every challenge, no matter how difficult, is an opportunity; to learn, to innovate, and to grow as one team. Status quo? Never. Courage? Always.
At TikTok, we create together and grow together. That's how we drive impact - for ourselves, our company, and the communities we serve.

The work needs to be fast, transferrable, while still down to the ground to make quick and solid differences.

In order to enhance collaboration and cross-functional partnerships, among other things, at this time, our organization follows a hybrid work schedule that requires employees to work in the office 3 days a week, or as directed by their manager/department.

Our platform connects people from across the globe and so does our workplace. At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. To achieve that goal, we are committed to celebrating our diverse voices and to creating an environment that reflects the many communities we reach. We are passionate about this and hope you are too.

At Hiya we are on a mission to secure the voice call with trust, identity, and intelligence. We're protecting everyday people from spam and fraud calls, connecting businesses with their customers, and helping mobile carriers secure their networks for all. In early 2016, we brought Hiya Protect to market through Samsung Smart Call, AT&T Call Protect (now Active Armor) the first-ever network-based spam solution, and the Hiya consumer app for iOS & Android. Three years later in 2019, we brought Hiya Connect to market, a B2B branded call SaaS solution that enables companies to connect to the consumers they are trying to reach. The combination of Protect, Connect, and the Hiya app has resulted in the world's largest Voice Security Platform with over 450M users.

About the Position

The Senior Data Analyst is an individual contributor position responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to both improve and demonstrate the performance of Hiya's security and protection products. The Senior Data Analyst drives improvement both at the high level, with project management duties related to the flow and processing of data, but also at a low level creating high quality robust dashboards. As a Senior Data Analyst you will strive to become a subject matter expert in the products you are working on and potentially participate in customer meetings.

The ideal candidate will be comfortable with some project management duties related to data. This may include things like sourcing data, managing competitive tests, and collecting dashboard requirements from other teams.

This employee works with a team of product managers, solutions architects, scientists, engineers and other analysts whose mission is to provide the best system for identifying spam and fraud activity on telecom networks across the globe.

We're excited about you because you're the kind of person that thinks at a systems level. When you have a task before you, you seek to understand the conditions that led to it as you design your solution. You are organized and able to push to completion activities and involve not only your individual activities but also external data vendors and processors. You're a lifelong learner and a mentor, equally happy to learn from your colleagues as you are to share knowledge with them.

You have a special skill in using data in order to tell a story to others, either externally or within the company. You reach beyond the charts and numbers to understand the real implications of what you find. You're able to be guided by your analysis to find valuable new threads to pursue, either to get a more complete picture or to find unique perspectives in the research. And once fully pursued, you can use this knowledge to tell the story to others, building a simple and non-technical narrative to explain what you've found.

What You'll Do


Manage and maintain pipelines and processes of data within Hiya, from sourcing to ingestion to analysis
Regularly work with BD, Sales, and Marketing to help them find stories within our data that furthers their own objectives
Frequently work with the Data Science team to explore new theories about voice call traffic worldwide

Familiarity with python / R or equivalent for automation
Strong experience with BI platforms including Sigma, and Tableau
Familiarity with big data analytics systems like Databricks
Familiarity with workflow management systems like Airflow
Well-practiced ability to timebox your own work; you intuitively know which threads to pursue, and how far to pursue them in your research
Self-driven curiosity to understand the data (and the implications behind it)


The person in this role must embody Hiya's key values of Serving our customers, Doing rather than observing, Improving ourselves and our business, Owning and holding ourselves accountable for success, and Leading by showing up with a point of view, engaging in open discussion, listening respectfully to others opinions and committing to decisions.

You will have a fast start if you have experience:


Working in AWS Databricks workbooks and building dashboards
Developing advanced SQL queries including window functions
Optimizing queries for efficient performance in millions or even billions of records
Writing one-pagers and executive summaries based on your research

In early 2016, we brought Hiya Protect to market through Samsung Smart Call, AT&amp;T Call Protect (now Active Armor) the first-ever network-based spam solution, and the Hiya consumer app for iOS &amp; Android. Three years later in 2019, we brought Hiya Connect to market, a B2B branded call SaaS solution that enables companies to connect to the consumers they are trying to reach.

At Hiya we are on a mission to secure the voice call with trust, identity, and intelligence. We're protecting everyday people from spam and fraud calls, connecting businesses with their customers, and helping mobile carriers secure their networks for all. In early 2016, we brought Hiya Protect to market through Samsung Smart Call, AT&T Call Protect (now Active Armor) the first-ever network-based spam solution, and the Hiya consumer app for iOS & Android. Three years later in 2019, we brought Hiya Connect to market, a B2B branded call SaaS solution that enables companies to connect to the consumers they are trying to reach. The combination of Protect, Connect, and the Hiya app has resulted in the world's largest Voice Security Platform with over 450M users.

About the Position

The Senior Data Analyst is an individual contributor position responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to both improve and demonstrate the performance of Hiya's security and protection products. The Senior Data Analyst drives improvement both at the high level, with project management duties related to the flow and processing of data, but also at a low level creating high quality robust dashboards. As a Senior Data Analyst you will strive to become a subject matter expert in the products you are working on and potentially participate in customer meetings.

The ideal candidate will be comfortable with some project management duties related to data. This may include things like sourcing data, managing competitive tests, and collecting dashboard requirements from other teams.

This employee works with a team of product managers, solutions architects, scientists, engineers and other analysts whose mission is to provide the best system for identifying spam and fraud activity on telecom networks across the globe.

We're excited about you because you're the kind of person that thinks at a systems level. When you have a task before you, you seek to understand the conditions that led to it as you design your solution. You are organized and able to push to completion activities and involve not only your individual activities but also external data vendors and processors. You're a lifelong learner and a mentor, equally happy to learn from your colleagues as you are to share knowledge with them.

You have a special skill in using data in order to tell a story to others, either externally or within the company. You reach beyond the charts and numbers to understand the real implications of what you find. You're able to be guided by your analysis to find valuable new threads to pursue, either to get a more complete picture or to find unique perspectives in the research. And once fully pursued, you can use this knowledge to tell the story to others, building a simple and non-technical narrative to explain what you've found.

What You'll Do


Manage and maintain pipelines and processes of data within Hiya, from sourcing to ingestion to analysis
Regularly work with BD, Sales, and Marketing to help them find stories within our data that furthers their own objectives
Frequently work with the Data Science team to explore new theories about voice call traffic worldwide
Develop and maintain production-quality dashboards able to be used internally and externally as tools to assist others in their own analyses
Conduct various tests on service performance, and write documentation to summarize those results


Qualities that will make you successful:


Excellent communication skills and the ability to simplify complex concepts
Strong SQL analytical skills
Familiarity with python / R or equivalent for automation
Strong experience with BI platforms including Sigma, and Tableau
Familiarity with big data analytics systems like Databricks
Familiarity with workflow management systems like Airflow
Well-practiced ability to timebox your own work; you intuitively know which threads to pursue, and how far to pursue them in your research
Self-driven curiosity to understand the data (and the implications behind it)


The person in this role must embody Hiya's key values of Serving our customers, Doing rather than observing, Improving ourselves and our business, Owning and holding ourselves accountable for success, and Leading by showing up with a point of view, engaging in open discussion, listening respectfully to others opinions and committing to decisions.

You will have a fast start if you have experience:


Working in AWS Databricks workbooks and building dashboards
Developing advanced SQL queries including window functions
Optimizing queries for efficient performance in millions or even billions of records
Writing one-pagers and executive summaries based on your research


The requirements listed in the job descriptions are guidelines. You don't have to satisfy every requirement or meet every qualification listed. If your skills are transferable we would still love to hear from you.

Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article. Please exercise caution and cease communications if something feels suspicious about your interactions.

About TikTok U.S. Data Security
TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. U.S. Data Security (“USDS”) is a subsidiary of TikTok in the U.S. This new, security-first division was created to bring heightened focus and governance to our data protection policies and content assurance protocols to keep U.S. users safe. Our focus is on providing oversight and protection of the TikTok platform and U.S. user data, so millions of Americans can continue turning to TikTok to learn something new, earn a living, express themselves creatively, or be entertained. The teams within USDS that deliver on this commitment daily span across Trust & Safety, Security & Privacy, Engineering, User & Product Ops, Corporate Functions and more.

Why Join Us
Creation is the core of TikTok's purpose. Our platform is built to help imaginations thrive. This is doubly true of the teams that make TikTok possible.
Together, we inspire creativity and bring joy - a mission we all believe in and aim towards achieving every day.
To us, every challenge, no matter how difficult, is an opportunity; to learn, to innovate, and to grow as one team. Status quo? Never. Courage? Always.
At TikTok, we create together and grow together. That's how we drive impact - for ourselves, our company, and the communities we serve.
Join us.

The USDS-Platform and Community Integrity (PaCI) team is missioned to: - Protect U.S. TikTok users, including and beyond content consumers, creators, and advertisers; - Secure platform health and community experience authenticity; - Build infrastructures, platforms, and technologies, as well as to collaborate with many cross-functional teams and stakeholders. The PaCI team works to minimize the damage of inauthentic behaviors on TikTok platforms, covering multiple classical and novel community and business risk areas such as account integrity, engagement authenticity, anti-spam, API abuse, growth fraud, live streaming security and financial safety, etc. In this team, you'll have a unique opportunity to have first-hand exposure to the strategy of the company in key security initiatives, especially in building scalable and robust, intelligent and privacy-safe, secure, and product-friendly systems and solutions. Our challenges are not some regular day-to-day technical puzzles -- You'll be part of a team that's developing novel solutions to first-seen challenges of a non-stop evolution of a phenomenal product eco-system. The work needs to be fast, transferrable, while still down to the ground to make quick and solid differences.

In order to enhance collaboration and cross-functional partnerships, among other things, at this time, our organization follows a hybrid work schedule that requires employees to work in the office 3 days a week, or as directed by their manager/department. We regularly review our hybrid work model, and the specific requirements may change at any time.

Responsibilities
Build rules to recognize, mitigate or prevent risky inauthentic behaviors on TikTok and its extended platforms. Such risks include and are not limited to abusive accounts, fake engagements, spammy redirection, scraping, fraud, etc.
Analyze business, product and security data, uncover evolving attack motion, identify weaknesses and opportunities in risk defense solutions, explore new space from the discoveries.
Quantify risk control effects and trends, collaborate with engineering, modeling, operational and product colleagues, contribute to risk measurement, perception, mitigation and prevention with data stories.

Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications:
Bachelor or degrees above in computer science, statistics, math, internet security or other relevant majors (e.g., finance if applying for financial fraud roles)
Strong analytical skills. Proficiency in statistical analytical tools, such as SQL and Python.

Preferred Qualifications:
Familiarity with social/content online platform analytics. Bonus given to proficiency in data mining skills e.g. modern machine applications.
Ability to think critically, objectively, rationally. Reason and communicate in result-oriented, data-driven manner. High autonomy.

Candidates for this position must be legally authorized to work in the United States. This position is not eligible for visa sponsorship or support.

TikTok is committed to creating an inclusive space where employees are valued for their skills, experiences, and unique perspectives. Our platform connects people from across the globe and so does our workplace. At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. To achieve that goal, we are committed to celebrating our diverse voices and to creating an environment that reflects the many communities we reach. We are passionate about this and hope you are too.

TikTok is committed to providing reasonable accommodations in our recruitment processes for candidates with disabilities, pregnancy, sincerely held religious beliefs or other reasons protected by applicable laws. If you need assistance or a reasonable accommodation, please reach out to us at https://shorturl.at/ktJP6.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.


The Coinbase Customer Experience (CX) organization plays an imperative role in achieving our mission. Our team is dedicated to eliminating compliance challenges, empowering our customer experience via self-service and automation, and optimizing customer support interactions to build an effortless experience. As a Senior Data Analyst on our team, you will own and drive projects that create meaningful business impact. You’ll have the opportunity to transform data into valuable business insights and help shape our strategy to deliver maximum impact to our customers, while also heavily influencing strategy, planning, and execution.

What You’ll Be Doing (ie. Job Duties)

Bord Gáis Energy is uniquely positioned to drive positive change and we have an opportunity, as well as a responsibility, to reshape our future. We’re powered by our purpose, and we all play a vital role in energising a greener, fairer future. While there are challenges ahead, we are dedicated to supporting our consumers and colleagues, to rethinking power generation, and to supporting an affordable and fair transition for all.

Role Purpose:

Bord Gáis Energy (BGE) is currently transforming how we store, process and leverage data through an ongoing agile cloud technology programme – to complement this technology strategy, we have built a Data Centre of Excellence (DCoE) combining reporting, analytics and data warehousing functions into one coherent customer-focused team. The role of Graduate Data Analyst in the DCoE team requires a combination of data, business and problem-solving skills.

About the Role (note – this is an entry level role and high-quality training will be provided):


Support the Reporting Team manager in delivering the aims of the Reporting team.
Use SQL (Oracle and SQL Server) and Power BI to extract, manipulate, understand and present ad-hoc data analyses.
Work seamlessly between our new cloud environment and the legacy on-premises databases.
Work with other members of the new central data team to ensure that end to end delivery of ad-hoc analyses and strategic reports is streamlined to maximise the new cloud data warehouse capabilities and minimise duplication of effort across the BGE organisation.
Work with our stakeholders across the business to anticipate new or emerging data requirements and help deliver reporting and data changes in an agile, timely and highly prioritised manner.
Work with key business stakeholders to resolve issues and deliver at speed without compromising on quality.
Following training and subject to availability, there will be opportunities to work with our other data teams such as our analytics team, our data warehousing team, our data transformation team and/or our data quality team.


The Ideal Candidate:


A recent graduate in a wide range of disciplines such as:
A business / economics / physics degree with a demonstrated data focus or similar.
A Computer Science degree with a concentration on data
A data analytics/science degree or similar
No subject matter expertise required – this is an entry level role
Any familiarity with the following is helpful:
Data visualisation tools such as Power BI, Tableau
SQL
Process driven – ability to follow and develop recognised processes (especially in SQL and Power BI) to ensure delivery of high quality, auditable reporting and data requirements.
Ability to participate actively in virtual cross functional teams to deliver major reporting and data projects.
Awareness of basic data quality standards especially those enforceable through GDPR regulations e.g. data retention, Article 30 data processing etc.


Preferred Qualifications, Skills and Performance Indicators:


A third level diploma in an appropriate discipline e.g. Business, Economics, Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, Physics, Mathematics etc.
The ability to listen, absorb information and communicate clearly is essential. Effective and cordial interactions with multiple areas and levels of the organisation will be the norm in this role and this team.
Ability to learn – be a strong collaborator who is willing to work hard on developing your own skills whilst also passing on all relevant learning to colleagues.
Ability to deliver – following training, the ability to build reports that are insightful, accurate, relevant, timely and easy to comprehend.
Ability to creatively problem solve and resolve bottlenecks and issues through a combination of logical and imaginative thinking.


In return, you’ll receive a competitive salary, generous annual leave allowance, and a host of other benefits, including volunteering days with our charity partner, Focus Ireland. You’ll also enjoy our friendly and collaborative culture, flexible ways of working, and you’ll be making a key contribution to Bord Gáis Energy’s commitment to environmental sustainability.

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing society and the energy sector has a key role to play in helping the world transition to net zero. As one of Ireland’s leading energy and services companies, we’re on a journey of transformation; to accelerate our positive impact and bring our customers on this journey with us. As we look to the future we're transforming our energy supply, services and solutions in order to become a leading net zero business in Ireland by 2045 and to help our customers reach net zero by 2050. Our ambition is to use our services, footprint and propositions to better both people and planet

Bord Gáis Energy are committed to placing equality, diversity, care and respect at the heart of our policies and everyday practices. We encourage everyone to take part in our active employee networks, including the Women's network, REACH (Race, Ethnicity, & Cultural Heritage) network, Neurodiversity network, and BRÓD, our LGBTQ+ network. We're proud of the work our networks and allies do to help us promote a culture of inclusion, empowering our colleagues to be themselves and do their best work. Our vision is to employ a diverse mix of people who reflect the societies we work in and the customers we serve, so we welcome applications from people of all backgrounds and perspectives.

Our Flexible First working model empowers our people to find a better balance between home and office working. You can enjoy the convenience of working from home combined with time spent onsite in a way that works for our customers, our business and you. Our office is used as a place to connect and collaborate with colleagues, rather than your default place of work each day.

Here in Bord Gáis Energy we’re helping to create a more sustainable and inclusive future that supports our communities, our planet – and each other. The prevention of family homelessness in Ireland is an area where we believe we can make a real difference and through our partnership with Focus Ireland, we have been working on making this a reality since 2015.
