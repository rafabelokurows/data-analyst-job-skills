Why join us?

Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Our mission is to help every company go beyond the books. Pleo itself means ‘more than you’d expect’, and it’s been the secret to our success over the last 8 years. So it’s only fitting that we’d pass this philosophy onto our customers to help them make the most of their finances.

We think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Finance teams shouldn’t be siloed from the rest of the organisation – they should work in unity with marketing, sales, IT and everyone else.

Speaking of working in unity, our values tell the story of how we work at Pleo. We have four core values, the first of which is ‘champion the customer’, which means we address real pain points that businesses face. Next up is ‘succeed as a team’, which highlights how our strength lies in our diversity and trust in each other. We also ‘make it happen’ by taking bold decisions and following through to deliver results. Last but not least, we ‘build to scale’, creating lasting solutions that address today’s challenges and anticipate tomorrow’s needs.

So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 850+ team, from over 100 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal and Lisbon offices —and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us, we'll help you set up the best remote setup possible and make sure you still have time to connect with your team.

Why join us?

Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Our mission is to help every company go beyond the books. Pleo itself means ‘more than you’d expect’, and it’s been the secret to our success over the last 8 years. So it’s only fitting that we’d pass this philosophy onto our customers to help them make the most of their finances.

We think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Finance teams shouldn’t be siloed from the rest of the organisation – they should work in unity with marketing, sales, IT and everyone else.

Speaking of working in unity, our values tell the story of how we work at Pleo. We have four core values, the first of which is ‘champion the customer’, which means we address real pain points that businesses face. Next up is ‘succeed as a team’, which highlights how our strength lies in our diversity and trust in each other. We also ‘make it happen’ by taking bold decisions and following through to deliver results. Last but not least, we ‘build to scale’, creating lasting solutions that address today’s challenges and anticipate tomorrow’s needs.

So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 850+ team, from over 100 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal and Lisbon offices —and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us, we'll help you set up the best remote setup possible and make sure you still have time to connect with your team.

Database Engineer

Building services that enable others

Springer Nature is one of the world’s leading global research, educational and professional publishers. It is home to an array of respected and trusted brands and imprints, with more than 170 years of combined history behind them, providing quality content through a range of innovative products and services. Every day, around the globe, our imprints, books, journals and resources reach millions of people, helping researchers and scientists to discover, students to learn and professionals to achieve their goals and ambitions. The company has around 10,000 staff in over 50 countries.

We’re looking for an experienced Database Engineer who will help us fulfil our mission to enable product teams to focus on delivering value.

About us: Engineering Enablement

The Engineering Enablement (EE) department consists of around 60 people, spread over teams that closely collaborate to fulfil our mission. In Springer Nature Technology (SNT) we serve different core expertise: PaaS, Databases, Observability and Cloud- and Release Engineering. You will join a multidisciplinary team with different nationalities, backgrounds and experience levels. We are a very distributed department but sometimes we travel to work with each other in person. We are based around the globe with main locations in London, Dordrecht, Berlin, Lisbon and New York.

Our Technology

We have built platforms serving hundreds of developers at scale around the world. We are making more and more use of Kubernetes as a backend container platform and integrating this into our platform offering. We are leveraging the power of Kubernetes to build a new PaaS that will co-exist with the current Cloud Foundry Platform, as well as managing an internal database platform that runs over 1,500 database servers.

Your team

This role is within the Database Engineering team, who are responsible for providing a managed database platform in a rapidly evolving and dynamic environment.

The team consists of Platform Engineers and Database Engineers who work together to provide managed database services - and the underlying cloud-based infrastructure - for internal customers across the organisation.

As with all teams in EE, we closely collaborate with the departmental teams that provide the platform’s surrounding and centralised services (CI/CD system, observability tools and our internal runtime platforms) and also with all the product development teams within Springer Nature.

Your responsibility

Together with the team, you will share the responsibility of provisioning, configuring and maintaining databases across multiple platforms.

Along with your team members, you provide expert services and guidance to development and product teams across Springer Nature. Developers will turn to you for support, guidance and assistance from initial provisioning to performance optimization.

You will use existing automation tools (based on Ansible) and improve them to manage our large number of servers and database instances.

Key Tasks


Maintaining and improving the database systems in production and development environments.
Provisioning, configuring, patching, upgrading, and maintaining databases in multiple platforms.
Automating the management of new and existing databases to ensure that processes are repeatable and scalable.
Monitoring and optimising database performance, including configuration, resource usage and query tuning.
Ensuring high availability of databases through clustering, replication, and other techniques.
Taking an active role in supporting and in finding the root cause of operational issues and preventing recurrences.
Working with the team to document processes, procedures, and technical designs related to database management.



In addition to database tasks, the team works together on the automation and infrastructure platform tooling. Upcoming planned work in the team includes adding serverless (CloudSQL, Memorystore, etc) and vector databases (Pinecone) to our core tooling, improving security patching automation and introducing continuous deployment for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

You will have the opportunity to work on new challenges and drive the evolution of our services in a collaborative and supportive environment.

About You

You are a friendly team member who is modest and humble, open to learning from anyone regardless of age, gender, race, role or experience. You value social interactions and can self-reflect by asking questions. You are self-confident and smart, but never a smart-ass. You have a strong preference for working together, sharing knowledge and training others as opposed to quickly getting things done alone.

Desired Skills And Experience


Knowledge and experience administrating with MongoDB.
Familiarity with one or more of the following technologies with a desire to expand on this knowledge: MySQL, ElasticSearch, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Marklogic, or Pinecone
Strong understanding of database architecture, backup and recovery, and performance tuning.
Experience with database clustering and replication mechanisms.
Familiarity with cloud-based database platforms, ideally GCP.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills.
Experience in automation and configuration management.



Preferred Skills And Experience


Experience of working with Cloud SQL
Experience working with Google BigQuery
Experience using Google Cloud Platform
Unix shell scripting or programming experience.
Experience with vector databases
High user and customer orientation
High sensitivity for security-relevant issues



Please note for internal candidates in Germany that this position is AT, therefore it will be paid outside the regular pay scale.

We are looking forward to your application. After reviewing your CV our Talent Acquisition team will contact you to schedule a short initial phone/video call. After getting this first step we will run 2-3 rounds (introductory, technical, cultural) with you - all of these with different members of the Engineering Enablement team. When appropriate these phases will be held via phone /video calls.

Internal applicants: We encourage you to speak to your manager once the interview process has started. At the point of offer acceptance, it is required that you inform your manager. If for any reason you’re unable to do so, please contact HR who can provide guidance as required.

At Travelex, data is at the heart of our relationship with our customers. We analyse data in order to understand what our customers prefer and how our products perform. Our work is fast-paced although our team remains collaborative and flexible even when delivering fast.

Your role as data analyst will be to run a wide range of queries on our datasets, interpret the results, and communicate your findings to colleagues and stakeholders. You will be working with product owners, subject matter experts, managers and engineers across the company to develop deep insight on our customers and products.

You will have an end-to-end responsibility for your deliverables: from leading the work to agree the right approach, through developing, running and continuously refining your queries, all the way to presenting your results and recommending what the business should do about them. You will have significant impact on the way our business evolves, and a high level of freedom to do things in your own way.

Responsibilities

Here are key things you’ll do as a data analyst in our team. The list isn’t complete: as a competent analyst, you’ll bring to Travelex your own ideas of what else is needed to become a world-class data-driven business.


Work with colleagues to understand their analytical needs and convert these into robust analytical tasks
Explore data in a range of business domains, such as: retail customer behaviour; online customer behaviour; payment cards; product performance; colleague performance; HR; finance, cost and pricing
Analyse data to understand trends, gaps and anomalies
Build time series, models and forecasts
Compare the performance of products, campaigns and sales across the different geographies where Travelex operates
Help automate analytical tasks so that powerful analytics can come with little effort
Present your findings in a simple, compelling and inspiring way
Develop visualisations and infographics that will shed light on complex business questions
Derive metrics from data and build the processes to monitor these metrics over time
Have particular responsibility for data quality: defining it, monitoring it and improving it


Key Requirements

This vacancy is for someone who greatly enjoys problem-solving, simplifying complex data into simple insight, and continuous learning. Below are key requirements from our data analyst, but you don’t need to tick every box: success in our team comes in many forms!


Competent in analysing data using SQL and Python
Familiar with AWS, including databases, data services and analytics capabilities
Experienced with SageMaker
Capable of creating engaging visualisations and infographics
A strong storyteller, who can turn a big pile of numbers into an interesting narrative
Self-starter and independent, able to turn loosely-defined requirements into concrete deliverables by asking questions, taking initiative and recommending a way forward
A good team player, who enjoys brainstorming and engaging, and is able to resolve differences of opinion in a constructive way
Understands the foundations of information security and data protection
Able to learn new tools, languages and methods quickly
Have the curiosity to understand the business, its requirements and culture
Knowledge of visualisation tools (e.g. Amazon QuickSight) and data modelling techniques isn’t essential but would be an advantage
Familiarity with DBT would be an advantage
Experience of building machine learning models, and familiarity with the common ML libraries in Python, would be an advantage
Your own unique style or way of working, which will make our team diverse and original

We stand up for individuality. We actively foster an inclusive workplace where diversity and individual difference are valued and leveraged to achieve the agency’s vision. And most importantly we value every individual’s wellbeing.

As a diversity champion, equal opportunities and disability confident employer and an ardent advocate of flexible working we understand that everyone has unique requirements and needs.

We are a global creative agency, but the individual really is at the heart of everything we do. We use data to find out what makes them tick. We use technology to talk to them one-to-one – but to one million at a time. And we use creativity to encourage them to engage, click, buy and bond, again and again.

Each brand is unique and has its own individual challenges. We pride ourselves in rising to each and every one of them, for brands such as KFC, Mercedes Benz, IKEA, Paypal and Virgin Media 02.

Us

In order to foster collaboration and relationships, our hybrid model requires three office days per week. As equal opportunities proponents, we are open to discuss any hybrid working related needs during the initial screening.

Learning and Development is important. We all know that. Its why we have a dedicated Learning and Development team and offer regular career conversations and bespoke L&D programmes so that you can leave us with more than when you started.

We recognise that the work of diversity, equity and inclusion calls on all of us. That’s why we set up The Neighbourhood. A collective of people, at different stages of the DE&I journey, whether impacted or allies, dedicated to helping our colleagues take ownership and effect change across 4 key pillars; Anti-racism, Disability, Gender & LGBTQ+ and Parents & Carers.

The Health and Wellbeing of our people matters immensely. We offer Coaching opportunities for all through our partnerships with Sanctus (mental health partner who provides online coaching; you can talk about anything, personal or professional) and Sayge (1:1 professional development coaching program). We have 40 trained Mental Health First Aiders across the agency and have Babylon Health (Private GP service) for all.

You’re better at work when you feel better in yourself. So, in addition to your annual holiday, you can take a “Me” day and an “Us” day, every year. Your “Me” day is for you to invest in yourself – go after a life goal, meditate, learn to paint, bake cakes or just have a duvet day watching Netflix!

Your “Us” day is all about giving back and helping others – volunteer, pick litter at a local park, hang out with the elderly or raise money for a local charity.

We’re progressive and always open to new initiatives, for example we’ve recently partnered with Fertifa (Leading Fertility and Reproductive Health benefit providers). Because we know the journey to becoming a family isn’t always easy (that includes men too), and we support our people through that journey whether you are new parent, experiencing the menopause, or anything else in between.

Whatever stage of life you are at, we make sure you have the tools you need to have a healthy work life balance.

US MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

Your Role

In the Data Analytics team you will ensure both the voice of the customer and CFO are represented in the room with hard evidence. As well as supporting exceptional customer experiences using data, you will help ensure every action we take is directly improving performance against your clients objectives.

As an Analyst, you will work under supervision to deliver projects within set deadlines, utilising your strong hands on analytical capabilities. Your strengths in Python and SQL will ensure you can efficiently deliver robust analytics with guidance from your team.

Your experience with web and social analytics tools (GA / Adobe / Brandwatch / Sprinklr) and data visualisation tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker / etc) will enable you to uncover key insights across channels and create self-service dashboards.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

At Travelex, data is at the heart of our relationship with our customers. We analyse data in order to understand what our customers prefer and how our products perform. Our work is fast-paced although our team remains collaborative and flexible even when delivering fast.

Your role as data analyst will be to run a wide range of queries on our datasets, interpret the results, and communicate your findings to colleagues and stakeholders. You will be working with product owners, subject matter experts, managers and engineers across the company to develop deep insight on our customers and products.

You will have an end-to-end responsibility for your deliverables: from leading the work to agree the right approach, through developing, running and continuously refining your queries, all the way to presenting your results and recommending what the business should do about them. You will have significant impact on the way our business evolves, and a high level of freedom to do things in your own way.

Responsibilities

Here are key things you’ll do as a data analyst in our team. The list isn’t complete: as a competent analyst, you’ll bring to Travelex your own ideas of what else is needed to become a world-class data-driven business.


Work with colleagues to understand their analytical needs and convert these into robust analytical tasks
Explore data in a range of business domains, such as: retail customer behaviour; online customer behaviour; payment cards; product performance; colleague performance; HR; finance, cost and pricing
Analyse data to understand trends, gaps and anomalies
Build time series, models and forecasts
Compare the performance of products, campaigns and sales across the different geographies where Travelex operates
Help automate analytical tasks so that powerful analytics can come with little effort
Present your findings in a simple, compelling and inspiring way
Develop visualisations and infographics that will shed light on complex business questions
Derive metrics from data and build the processes to monitor these metrics over time
Have particular responsibility for data quality: defining it, monitoring it and improving it


Key Requirements

This vacancy is for someone who greatly enjoys problem-solving, simplifying complex data into simple insight, and continuous learning. Below are key requirements from our data analyst, but you don’t need to tick every box: success in our team comes in many forms!


Competent in analysing data using SQL and Python
Familiar with AWS, including databases, data services and analytics capabilities
Experienced with SageMaker
Capable of creating engaging visualisations and infographics
A strong storyteller, who can turn a big pile of numbers into an interesting narrative
Self-starter and independent, able to turn loosely-defined requirements into concrete deliverables by asking questions, taking initiative and recommending a way forward
A good team player, who enjoys brainstorming and engaging, and is able to resolve differences of opinion in a constructive way
Understands the foundations of information security and data protection
Able to learn new tools, languages and methods quickly
Have the curiosity to understand the business, its requirements and culture
Knowledge of visualisation tools (e.g. Amazon QuickSight) and data modelling techniques isn’t essential but would be an advantage
Familiarity with DBT would be an advantage
Experience of building machine learning models, and familiarity with the common ML libraries in Python, would be an advantage
Your own unique style or way of working, which will make our team diverse and original


Why Travelex?

We are customer-centric and innovative. Our digital and data products are part of our investment in the future of Foreign Exchange, cross-border e-commerce and international payments.

I'm partnered with a client who are looking for a Senior Data Analyst to drive their analytical capability, this is an exciting greenfield role with lots of scope to add real value.




There is endless opportunity in this role to have real commercial impact using the power of Data Analytics. You will play a role in the data collection, managing what comes out of data pipelines, and you also work to drive their strategic projects.




The Data team is still quite small, so they're looking for this person to really drive analytics capability forward. You'll have the opportunity to design new product proposals and design and launch new digital products.




From a tech tool point of view, they are quite agnostic in terms of previous tools used. SQL is a must, partnered with previous use of a data viz tool.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

As per the current Public Health Order, full vaccination against COVID-19 is a condition of employment with PHSA as of October 26, 2021.

What We Do

Provincial Laboratory Medicine Services (PLMS) provides laboratory testing at 31 sites across the lower mainland and central coast of BC, including acute care hospital laboratories and specialty laboratories.

PLMS is part of the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA).

The Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) plans, manages and evaluates specialized health services with the BC health authorities to provide equitable and cost-effective health care for people throughout the province. Our values reflect our commitment to excellence and include: Respect people – Be compassionate – Dare to innovate – Cultivate partnerships – Serve with purpose. Learn more about PHSA and our programs: jobs.phsa.ca/programs-and-services

PHSA and PLMS are committed to employment equity, encouraging all qualified individuals to apply. We recognize that our ability to provide the best care for our diverse patient populations relies on a rich diversity of skills, knowledge, background and experience, and value a safe, inclusive and welcoming environment.

Reconciliation is an ongoing process and a shared responsibility for all of us. The BC Governments’ unanimous passage of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act was a significant step forward in this journey—one that all health authorities are expected to support as we work in cooperation with Indigenous Peoples to establish a clear and sustainable path to lasting reconciliation. True reconciliation will take time and ongoing commitment to work with Indigenous Peoples as they move toward self-determination. Guiding these efforts Crown agencies must remain focused on creating opportunities that implement the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Mandate.

We invited others to join us and there are now more than 300 businesses and organizations across 51 industries and 29 countries that have signed the Pledge, which means we are collectively coming at the climate crisis from nearly every sector and nearly every angle.

As part of our efforts to decarbonize our business, we became the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in 2020. We are on a path to power our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025.

We recently announced that AWS will be water positive by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations. The company also announced its 2021 global water use efficiency (WUE) metric of 0.25 liters of water per kilowatt-hour, demonstrating AWS’s leadership in water efficiency among cloud providers. To learn more about AWS’s water+ commitment visit: Water Stewardship.

Come join the team that is building the tools and innovative technology to track and share sustainability metrics for our customers.

As a Data Engineering Leader with Amazon, you will mentor and lead engineers. You will guide your team towards the best data development practices. You will serve as a leader in the team to define the priorities and vision of the group. You will collaborate with users around the globe.

About Us

Inclusive Team Culture

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship & Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Key job responsibilities

Our team operates the public Customer Carbon Footprint Tool and we have a high bar for releasing data to tens of thousands of AWS customers each month.

The successful applicant will work with our Product and SDE teams to build data systems that will simplify bringing new models to customers and enhance the visibility into our underlying modeling process.
