The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

At Travelex, data is at the heart of our relationship with our customers. We analyse data in order to understand what our customers prefer and how our products perform. Our work is fast-paced although our team remains collaborative and flexible even when delivering fast.

Your role as data analyst will be to run a wide range of queries on our datasets, interpret the results, and communicate your findings to colleagues and stakeholders. You will be working with product owners, subject matter experts, managers and engineers across the company to develop deep insight on our customers and products.

You will have an end-to-end responsibility for your deliverables: from leading the work to agree the right approach, through developing, running and continuously refining your queries, all the way to presenting your results and recommending what the business should do about them. You will have significant impact on the way our business evolves, and a high level of freedom to do things in your own way.

Responsibilities

Here are key things you’ll do as a data analyst in our team. The list isn’t complete: as a competent analyst, you’ll bring to Travelex your own ideas of what else is needed to become a world-class data-driven business.


Work with colleagues to understand their analytical needs and convert these into robust analytical tasks
Explore data in a range of business domains, such as: retail customer behaviour; online customer behaviour; payment cards; product performance; colleague performance; HR; finance, cost and pricing
Analyse data to understand trends, gaps and anomalies
Build time series, models and forecasts
Compare the performance of products, campaigns and sales across the different geographies where Travelex operates
Help automate analytical tasks so that powerful analytics can come with little effort
Present your findings in a simple, compelling and inspiring way
Develop visualisations and infographics that will shed light on complex business questions
Derive metrics from data and build the processes to monitor these metrics over time
Have particular responsibility for data quality: defining it, monitoring it and improving it


Key Requirements

This vacancy is for someone who greatly enjoys problem-solving, simplifying complex data into simple insight, and continuous learning. Below are key requirements from our data analyst, but you don’t need to tick every box: success in our team comes in many forms!


Competent in analysing data using SQL and Python
Familiar with AWS, including databases, data services and analytics capabilities
Experienced with SageMaker
Capable of creating engaging visualisations and infographics
A strong storyteller, who can turn a big pile of numbers into an interesting narrative
Self-starter and independent, able to turn loosely-defined requirements into concrete deliverables by asking questions, taking initiative and recommending a way forward
A good team player, who enjoys brainstorming and engaging, and is able to resolve differences of opinion in a constructive way
Understands the foundations of information security and data protection
Able to learn new tools, languages and methods quickly
Have the curiosity to understand the business, its requirements and culture
Knowledge of visualisation tools (e.g. Amazon QuickSight) and data modelling techniques isn’t essential but would be an advantage
Familiarity with DBT would be an advantage
Experience of building machine learning models, and familiarity with the common ML libraries in Python, would be an advantage
Your own unique style or way of working, which will make our team diverse and original


Why Travelex?

To remain the world’s leading Foreign Exchange specialist, we focus on making our customers’ lives hassle-free while they travel.

We are customer-centric and innovative. Our digital and data products are part of our investment in the future of Foreign Exchange, cross-border e-commerce and international payments.

We are an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity. We never discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability.

We stand up for individuality. We actively foster an inclusive workplace where diversity and individual difference are valued and leveraged to achieve the agency’s vision. And most importantly we value every individual’s wellbeing.

As a diversity champion, equal opportunities and disability confident employer and an ardent advocate of flexible working we understand that everyone has unique requirements and needs.

We are a global creative agency, but the individual really is at the heart of everything we do. We use data to find out what makes them tick. We use technology to talk to them one-to-one – but to one million at a time. And we use creativity to encourage them to engage, click, buy and bond, again and again.

Each brand is unique and has its own individual challenges. We pride ourselves in rising to each and every one of them, for brands such as KFC, Mercedes Benz, IKEA, Paypal and Virgin Media 02.

Us

In order to foster collaboration and relationships, our hybrid model requires three office days per week. As equal opportunities proponents, we are open to discuss any hybrid working related needs during the initial screening.

Learning and Development is important. We all know that. Its why we have a dedicated Learning and Development team and offer regular career conversations and bespoke L&D programmes so that you can leave us with more than when you started.

We recognise that the work of diversity, equity and inclusion calls on all of us. That’s why we set up The Neighbourhood. A collective of people, at different stages of the DE&I journey, whether impacted or allies, dedicated to helping our colleagues take ownership and effect change across 4 key pillars; Anti-racism, Disability, Gender & LGBTQ+ and Parents & Carers.

The Health and Wellbeing of our people matters immensely. We offer Coaching opportunities for all through our partnerships with Sanctus (mental health partner who provides online coaching; you can talk about anything, personal or professional) and Sayge (1:1 professional development coaching program). We have 40 trained Mental Health First Aiders across the agency and have Babylon Health (Private GP service) for all.

You’re better at work when you feel better in yourself. So, in addition to your annual holiday, you can take a “Me” day and an “Us” day, every year. Your “Me” day is for you to invest in yourself – go after a life goal, meditate, learn to paint, bake cakes or just have a duvet day watching Netflix!

Your “Us” day is all about giving back and helping others – volunteer, pick litter at a local park, hang out with the elderly or raise money for a local charity.

We’re progressive and always open to new initiatives, for example we’ve recently partnered with Fertifa (Leading Fertility and Reproductive Health benefit providers). Because we know the journey to becoming a family isn’t always easy (that includes men too), and we support our people through that journey whether you are new parent, experiencing the menopause, or anything else in between.

Whatever stage of life you are at, we make sure you have the tools you need to have a healthy work life balance.

US MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

We use data derived from multiple integrations including leisure centres, commercial sport facilities, wearable technology, community programmes, major sporting events, and healthcare providers. Connecting and standardising this data, positions 4GLOBAL uniquely in the provision of the following services:




Predict the likely outcomes of significant investment in sport and physical activity programmes at a local and national level, setting the sector standard for data driven insights.
Evaluate, monitor and benchmark the impact of new sport and physical activity investments.
Analyse the actual patterns in behaviours of individuals and how they participate (or not) in sport and activity programmes.

Work with our clients to predict what will drive participation and best method to engage people in sport who are currently inactive.

We use data derived from multiple integrations including leisure centres, commercial sport facilities, wearable technology, community programmes, major sporting events, and healthcare providers. Connecting and standardising this data, positions 4GLOBAL uniquely in the provision of the following services:




Predict the likely outcomes of significant investment in sport and physical activity programmes at a local and national level, setting the sector standard for data driven insights.
Evaluate, monitor and benchmark the impact of new sport and physical activity investments.
Analyse the actual patterns in behaviours of individuals and how they participate (or not) in sport and activity programmes.

Work with our clients to predict what will drive participation and best method to engage people in sport who are currently inactive.

Exercise advanced knowledge of SQL to extract critical information and business value from data spread across multiple databases and data formats.

What It Takes To Succeed


Ideally 3 years of experience in business intelligence or as a business systems analyst, data analyst/developer or similar role.

What You'll Get
