More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

We’re building the software infrastructure that enables hospital-quality care, at home. As healthcare costs have increased, the patient’s home has become incredibly important as a site of care.




Yet, patients recovering at home are highly underserved. Patients can only get better at home if they receive the high-quality care that they need reliably. The existing in-home care process involves patchwork of different vendors, all connected through faxes by nurses. We’re building modern, robust software that solves this challenge. We currently work with patients and hospitals across the United States.




We’re backed by some of the best investors in technology and healthcare and have ambitious expansion plans. It’s a particularly exciting time to join the company as we’re aggressively expanding the team.




What the role consists of:

Serve as the primary data analyst for Sales, Operations, and other business teams, providing critical support in data-driven decision-making.
Create and maintain reports, dashboards, and data visualizations to support business intelligence teams for a variety of stakeholders.
Use SQL to extract and manipulate data, ensuring high data quality and consistency.
Present findings and insights to stakeholders, providing actionable recommendations to support organizational strategies.
Collaborate with engineering to optimize data structures and ensure the accuracy of data analytics.




What we're looking for:

2+ years of relevant experience in a full-time data analysis role.
SQL Experience. Candidate should be comfortable writing and reading SQL queries in a data analysis and visualization capacity.
Data visualization within business intelligence tools. Candidate should be comfortable taking a data request, and matching it to an appropriate visualization for the data, and outputting the visualization in a tool like Metabase, Tableau, Power BI, etc.
Experience working in collaboration with engineering or database administration teams, or direct experience in those functions
Comfort working in high-visibility settings to present findings such as in a company-wide meeting or broader industry setting.




Why this role:

Fast career progression. We’re at an inflection point as a company and want our team members to grow with us.
Work in a collaborative, dynamic environment.
Work in a low bureaucracy environment that allows you to do your job well.
The data analyst role is one of the most cross-functional job descriptions within our company. Get exposure to and work with all major stakeholders, both technical and non-technical.

Ben jij op zoek naar een nieuwe uitdaging met afwisseling én een goede werk-privébalans? Dan zou Datamo wel eens de plek voor jou kunnen zijn! Bij Datamo haal je het beste uit jezelf door veel kennis en ervaring op te doen bij toonaangevende organisaties. Samen met jou stellen we een persoonlijk ontwikkelplan op, zodat je specifieke expertise kunt opdoen en de gewenste opleidingen kunt volgen.




Ontvang bij Datamo een compleet pakket, zoals een salaris tot € 7.000 bruto per maand, jaarlijks 35 vrij op te nemen dagen, en bepaal zelf hoe je naar je opdrachtgevers reist met behulp van een mobiliteitsbudget, vrij te besteden voor eigen vervoer of een leaseauto (zoals een Tesla Model 3).




De functie

Als Data Consultant bij Datamo krijg je de kans om jouw talenten te benutten en waardevolle ervaring op te doen bij diverse spraakmakende opdrachtgevers als financiële instellingen zoals de ING of overheidsorganisaties zoals ministeries of overige organisaties zoals KLM, NS en nog veel meer. Bij Datamo werk je op projectbasis, van 3 maanden tot 1 jaar, of indien gewenst zelfs langer. Je werkt in diverse rollen, zoals Data Engineer, Data Analyst of Data Scientist, afhankelijk van jouw voorkeur, ervaring en expertise. Voor wat jouw specifieke opdracht betreft zullen wij verschillende keuzes aan je voorleggen. Jij bepaalt uiteindelijk helemaal zelf welke opdracht je gaat uitvoeren, want wij willen niets liever dan dat jij op een plek zit die helemaal bij je past




Jouw taken

Het exacte takenpakket hangt volledig af van de opdracht die je gaat vervullen en natuurlijk ook van de organisatie waarvoor je aan de slag gaat.




Onderstaande taken kun je onder andere verwachten bij verschillende rollen als Data Consultant:

• Data analyseren om belangrijke patronen en trends te ontdekken

• Data Clustering, Data Mining en Data Visualisatie.

• Gesprekspartner zijn voor eindgebruikers om visualisaties optimaal te maken

• Data integreren voor het optimaliseren van analyses.

• Advies verstrekken over het effectief gebruiken van data voor besluitvorming.

• Rapporten opstellen om complexe data inzichtelijk te maken voor collega’s.

• Het ontwikkelen van producten en innovatieve modellen goed laten samengaan met software-oplossingen.




Wie zoeken wij?

Wij zoeken een enthousiaste en leergierige collega die het leuk vindt projectmatig ervaring op te doen in diverse branches, organisaties en functies. Daarnaast:

Heb je minimaal 2 jaar relevante werkervaring.
Ben je in het bezit van een hbo-/wo-diploma.
Ben je in staat goede relaties op te bouwen en te onderhouden met onze opdrachtgevers.
Weet jij wel raad met Python, R, VBA, JavaScript, Power BI (Tableau, Qlik), SQL, Excel en Azure/AWS.
Beschik je over sterke communicatieve vaardigheden.
Heb je een uitstekende beheersing van de Nederlandse taal (schrijven en spreken).




Wat kun je verwachten van Datamo?

Datamo is onderdeel van de grotere ‘Thuis van’-formule, wat betekent dat je onderdeel bent van een grotere organisatie bestaande uit 75 collega’s, die werkzaam zijn bij Datamo (Data Specialisten), Entrador (Business Analisten), Specktor (Product Owners) en Strates (Roostersoftware Specialisten). Onderling delen we kennis en netwerk met elkaar. Allen met dezelfde normen en waarden: het creëren van een thuisgevoel, het beste uit iedereen halen door jou zo goed mogelijk te faciliteren.




Datamo is een platte organisatie, je vindt bij ons geen onnodige directie of managementlagen, maar wel korte communicatielijnen. Jouw potentieel en geluk staan centraal, en wij willen jou daar graag in ondersteunen. Je bent bij ons zeker geen nummer, maar wel een hele belangrijke collega!

En laten we eerlijk zijn, bij Datamo wordt “data crunchen” ineens een stuk gezelliger. We combineren vakinhoudelijke ontwikkeling met sociale activiteiten, zodat je niet alleen groeit in je vakgebied, maar ook in je connecties binnen het team. We organiseren regelmatig groepsactiviteiten waarbij geldt dat je niet moet, maar mag deelnemen!

Last but not least… Bij Datamo is de balans tussen werk en privé erg belangrijk. Niet voor niets geven we je 35 vrij op te nemen dagen per jaar en overwerken staat niet in ons vocabulaire.




Wat bieden wij jou?

Een uitstekend salaris tussen de € 4.500 en € 7.000 bruto per maand bestaande uit een vast en een variabel component;
35 vrij op te nemen dagen per jaar;
Een meer dan goede pensioenregeling;
Mobiliteitsbudget, vrij te besteden voor flexibel zakelijk vervoer: NS, fiets, taxi, Uber, deelauto, je eigen auto etc. en/of te besteden voor een eigen leaseauto.
Een MacBook Air;
Een maandelijkse telefoonvergoeding;
Gezellige uitjes, georganiseerd door en voor Datamo collega’s!
Waardevolle (in-house) trainings- en kennissessies;
Goede opleidingsmogelijkheden, ‘’the sky is the limit’’;
Meerdere interessante bonusregelingen voor bijvoorbeeld het aandragen van nieuwe collega’s.
Een fijne werkplek in ons monumentale pand in het centrum van het mooie Amersfoort.

The work you do will impact your team and your internal and external stakeholders, and ultimately also the client servicing process and therefore the bank’s core business. Our Data Chapter colleagues have been able to incorporate sophisticated data sources into the latest projects. The projects vary from the credit risk to the reporting domain. This directly impacts the way Rabobank actively serves its clients. Also it directly contributes to the bank’s financial stability and allows the regulators to see we’re in control.

Practical Examples


Source Data for Credit Risk Models
Historical Datasets of 20 years.
Analysing Databases.


Facts & Figures


36 or 40 hours per week
43,000 Rabobank colleagues around the world


Top 4 Responsibilities


Analysis and determination of the scope of data to be archived to Modeldata-HiSDA (Highly Secured Data Archive) of a decomissioned system.
Analysis and determination of the scope of sources from GDP to Modeldata- HiSDA. Due to GDPR retention.
Reasoning from the mandate for HiSDA and data products in these analyses.
Guiding the team on how to store data so it can be used for Credit Modelling.


As a Data Analyst you will be working in the Chapter Data. You will be working on projects mainly focused on Credit Modelling and will collaborate a lot with different colleagues in the Tribe Data Factory and Tribe Credit Analytics.

Together we achieve more than alone

We believe in the power of diversity. Bringing together people's differences is what makes us an even better bank. So we are very curious about what you can bring to our Chapter Data Modelling & Insights.

“As member in the Area Model Data you are working together in a very motivated hybride team of 14 people who are focused on data archiving and sourcing for Credit Risk Modelling”

Arjan Schoutens, Product Manager Modeldata

Around 240 professionals in Chapter Data, are teaming up in several area’s and squads to support the tribes within our finance and risk domain of the bank. Working together is the way we work; as one creative problem solving team of experts at Rabobank. Talking of Rabobank: We are a Dutch bank that operates in 38 countries for over 9,500,000 customers. Together with these customers, our members and partners we stand side by side to create a world in which everyone has access to enough healthy food. In the Netherlands we work to create a country in which people are happy with how they live, work and do business.

Strong communication skills in English, both spoken and written


This Is What We Offer You


A gross annual salary between € 4.292,- and € 6.130,- per month based on 36 hours per week. Scale 9 (depending on your experience and seniority).

You’ll help publish data in easy to consume, understandable ways that allow stakeholders to self-service some of their data needs
You’ll be a champion of our analytic abilities, while ensuring accurate and ethical use of data

Kids spend most of their days in the classroom. And teachers and staff, who play a vital role in their development, are often the first to notice when something is off. But with 1 in 5 young people struggling with mental health, schools are getting crushed by a downward spiral in student crises and staff burnout.

With large increases in federal funding for schools and the rise of telehealth, schools are reimagining what mental health support can look like.

Cartwheel is an early-stage startup building technology-enabled mental health services that put schools at the center. We see our role as supporting on-campus counselors, psychologists, and school social workers who see kids every day. Instead of going around them, we collaborate with them. This means:


Earlier intervention
Higher student and family engagement in care
Better coordination among the trusted adults in a student's life


Kids shouldn't just aspire to get out of bed and drag themselves to class. They should be able to experience joy. They deserve to envision and build a life they're excited to live. If you join Cartwheel, you'll help make this vision a reality for millions of students across the country. We're backed by top investors including Menlo Ventures, Reach Capital, General Catalyst, BoxGroup, and Able Partners, and we're looking for mission-driven teammates to join our team.

ABOUT THE ROLE

As Cartwheel's second data team member, you will help our leaders make data-driven decisions by developing analytical tools and dashboards. In doing so, you'll empower Cartwheel to build an exceptional clinical program, scalable business, and highly efficient team.

Location: Remote

WHAT YOU'LL DO


Leverage data to drive strategic decision-making across the company, providing data-driven insights to inform strategy and direction.
Develop, implement, and maintain data analytics systems and predictive models, including developing outputs in the form of dashboards at the enterprise and function levels.
Communicate complex data in understandable ways to clinicians, engineers, business leaders, and other audiences
Collaborate with other departments, including product, engineering, operations, and clinical to define metrics, track success, and answer critical business questions. Example questions may include:
School district performance: How is Cartwheel performing in each school district (e.g., referrals received vs. expected, conversion rates to first therapy session, number of sessions per student, no-show rates, customer satisfaction, clinical outcomes)? In which districts are there meaningful performance gaps compared to company goals and how might these gaps be closed?
Workforce planning: What is the expected need for clinicians, care coordinators, and other care roles by month by state? Have we over-hired or under-hired? When backtesting, how accurate are our workforce planning projections compared to actuals and how can we improve the model's performance?
Care funnel performance: How quickly are we getting kids into care? Where are the key drop-off points in the care journey? Can we use predictive modeling to identify which families could most benefit from extra support to reduce no-show rates and improve clinical outcomes and target resources to those families?


WHO YOU ARE


Experience in mental health and supporting schools, students, and families
Interested in using data to improve our business operations and client outcomes
2-4 years of experience and demonstrated success in data analytics/data science roles
Deeply knowledgeable about data architecture, modeling, machine learning algorithms, and visualization tools
Exceptional analytical and problem-solving skills
Experienced in the healthcare industry, ideally mental health, and fluent in data privacy laws including HIPAA
Strong communicator and presenter, including to lay audiences
Excited to work in a fast-paced, dynamic startup environment
Proficient in data analytics software and languages, such as Python, R, SQL, etc.
Proficient with BI tools such as Looker and Snowflake


Even if you don't meet every qualification, if you are excited about shaping the future of mental health care and think you might be a good fit for this role, please apply!

WHY YOU'LL LOVE CARTWHEEL

Our hope is that Cartwheel will be your best career decision! In addition to tackling one of the biggest challenges of our time, at a company well-positioned to do so, you'll have:


Team-based culture with mission-driven colleagues who will go to bat for you
Based on candidate experience, the total cash compensation is expected to be between $140,000 - $150,000
Excellent health insurance
Meaningful equity ownership stake
Flexible paid time off
Hybrid work environment with regular in-person team retreats
401K with employer match
$500 annual educational stipend
Macbook

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have an absolute love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem, and living inside a spreadsheet/data set to find the answer to any question.
Because you love data, you have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, Google Data Studio/Data Visualization and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis. Experience with Marketing APIs, Big Query or other Cloud Data Warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.), ETL Tools (Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics) and/or Python are all pluses.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and have spent a minimum of 1 year working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.




What You’ll Do:

Reporting: With your expertise in Advanced Excel, SQL, Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools, you’ll be maintaining customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence, generating pivot tables and other visualizations that summarize thousands of lines of data. You should have experience in translating performance media metrics into coherent, digestible reports for client ad campaigns and be comfortable communicating via Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.
Strategy: You’ll be responsible for learning our clients’ businesses and aligning their media strategy with business goals as well as understanding advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to help guide media buying strategy. With a background in paid media and/or digital advertising, you understand concepts like LTV, ROAS and Incremental Revenue and are able to be engaged in discussions with clients to gain trust and shareholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is undertaking a multi-year project known as the Business Enterprise Systems Transformation (BEST) Program to implement a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software solution that will support a wide range of business functions used by all state agencies. The initial scope of the project is to implement functionality that supports Financial Management of the Commonwealth by replacing its core financial and accounting system, currently known as MMARS, which is used by 150+ state agencies. It is envisioned that the new solution will also include additional modules that support a full software suite capable of addressing government business needs including Human Capital Management, Payroll and other capabilities that will provide the Commonwealth with the capacity to migrate other applications to a single solution platform over time should it elect to do so. It is the Commonwealth's intent that the ERP solution will be delivered as a SaaS (cloud) solution that will replace the Commonwealth's current heavy investment in highly customized software housed ""on premise on virtual or physical servers.The BEST Program is jointly sponsored by the Secretary for Administration and Finance, Comptroller of the Commonwealth and the Secretary of Technology Services and Security. This job posting is being issued through the Office of the Comptroller.

Position Summary

The BEST Program Data Analyst/BI Engineer (DA/BI) will work with a Team comprised of BEST Program staff, agency business and technical SMEs and the new solution system integrator (SI) and product vendor to design and implement the data information management and reporting strategies, tools, and outputs to provide a robust reporting and data analytics capacity for users of the new Financials solution. The implementation of the new Financials solution will provide users with the ability to run queries and reports on the live data in this application directly rather than waiting for data to be available through warehouse reports. Data will be integrated across modules permitting more robust, real-time reporting and analytics capabilities.

The BEST Program Data Analyst/BI Engineer will work with the BEST Financials Data Lead to identify reporting, dashboard and business analytics needs that will drive the configuration of standard reports and dashboards delivered through the new Financials solution. The DA/BI Lead will assist in leading requirements sessions with BEST staff, agency staff and the system integrator and product vendor to review the reporting and analytics capabilities of the new solution and to identify available configuration options. The DA/BI Lead will develop and maintain a list of selected configurations for each report and dashboard and work with reports/dashboard developers during configuration to assist in translating business requirements to the configured reports. The DA/BI Lead will also participate in testing configured reports and dashboards and in organizing user testing of these items.

Whenever feasible, the BEST Program intends to adopt delivered reports and dashboards, but in instances where reporting requirements cannot be met by the delivered solutions, the DA/BI Lead will work with business and the system integrator and product vendor to identify requirements for future report development and participate in testing of these items when they are developed. The DA/BI Lead will work with business and the system integrator and product vendor to identify opportunities for improving the availability of data for reporting and analytics by understanding the solution's capacities in this area, sharing that information with business and documenting implementation options with owners of other Commonwealth business intelligence and data analytics resources.

Under this policy, all employees must be able to report to the Boston office with little or no notice, even including the same workday should an exigent circumstance arise. Therefore, a reasonable proximity to the office is necessary. CTR does not reimburse for employees to travel to the office. In addition, the successful candidate may be required to work primarily on site in Boston during the initial training and orientation period and/or for certain positions a primarily on-site role may be necessary.)<br><br><strong> Interview: </strong>Initial contact by phone, interview may be conducted in-person or by video conference<br><br><strong> Engagement Length:</strong> 1 year (with possible renewal)<br><br><strong> Hours Per Week:</strong> 37.5<br><br>The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is undertaking a multi-year project known as the Business Enterprise Systems Transformation (BEST) Program to implement a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software solution that will support a wide range of business functions used by all state agencies. The initial scope of the project is to implement functionality that supports Financial Management of the Commonwealth by replacing its core financial and accounting system, currently known as MMARS, which is used by 150+ state agencies. It is envisioned that the new solution will also include additional modules that support a full software suite capable of addressing government business needs including Human Capital Management, Payroll and other capabilities that will provide the Commonwealth with the capacity to migrate other applications to a single solution platform over time should it elect to do so. It is the Commonwealth's intent that the ERP solution will be delivered as a SaaS (cloud) solution that will replace the Commonwealth's current heavy investment in highly customized software housed ""on premise on virtual or physical servers.The BEST Program is jointly sponsored by the Secretary for Administration and Finance, Comptroller of the Commonwealth and the Secretary of Technology Services and Security. This job posting is being issued through the Office of the Comptroller.<br><br><strong>Position Summary<br><br></strong>The <strong> BEST Program Data Analyst/BI Engineer</strong> (DA/BI) will work with a Team comprised of BEST Program staff, agency business and technical SMEs and the new solution system integrator (SI) and product vendor to design and implement the data information management and reporting strategies, tools, and outputs to provide a robust reporting and data analytics capacity for users of the new Financials solution. The implementation of the new Financials solution will provide users with the ability to run queries and reports on the live data in this application directly rather than waiting for data to be available through warehouse reports. Data will be integrated across modules permitting more robust, real-time reporting and analytics capabilities.<br><br>The <strong> BEST Program Data Analyst/BI Engineer</strong> will work with the BEST Financials Data Lead to identify reporting, dashboard and business analytics needs that will drive the configuration of standard reports and dashboards delivered through the new Financials solution. The DA/BI Lead will assist in leading requirements sessions with BEST staff, agency staff and the system integrator and product vendor to review the reporting and analytics capabilities of the new solution and to identify available configuration options. The DA/BI Lead will develop and maintain a list of selected configurations for each report and dashboard and work with reports/dashboard developers during configuration to assist in translating business requirements to the configured reports. The DA/BI Lead will also participate in testing configured reports and dashboards and in organizing user testing of these items.<br><br>Whenever feasible, the BEST Program intends to adopt delivered reports and dashboards, but in instances where reporting requirements cannot be met by the delivered solutions, the DA/BI Lead will work with business and the system integrator and product vendor to identify requirements for future report development and participate in testing of these items when they are developed. The DA/BI Lead will work with business and the system integrator and product vendor to identify opportunities for improving the availability of data for reporting and analytics by understanding the solution's capacities in this area, sharing that information with business and documenting implementation options with owners of other Commonwealth business intelligence and data analytics

Ability to lift files, records, and computer paper (approximately 5-10 lbs.)
Ability to operate a computer, phone system and general office equipment.
Work over 40 hours per week as business needs deem appropriate.




At Hines, we strive for excellence as a leading global real estate investment manager, driven by our by our belief that real estate is fundamentally about people. Our diverse portfolio spans $93.2 billion¹ of assets across such property types as living, office, retail, mixed-use, logistics and life science projects – all designed to enhance value, connection and inspiration. Our strategic approach integrates local expertise with global knowledge, taking calculated risks aligned with our convictions to exceed expectations and tailor solutions to our clients' needs.




While our projects are renowned for enhancing cities and pioneering sustainable practices, we recognize that the true driving force behind Hines' success is our 5,000 dedicated employees in 30 countries who draw on our 65-year history to build the world forward.

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have an absolute love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem, and living inside a spreadsheet/data set to find the answer to any question.
Because you love data, you have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, Google Data Studio/Data Visualization and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis. Experience with Marketing APIs, Big Query or other Cloud Data Warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.), ETL Tools (Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics) and/or Python are all pluses.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and have spent a minimum of 1 year working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.




What You’ll Do:

Reporting: With your expertise in Advanced Excel, SQL, Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools, you’ll be maintaining customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence, generating pivot tables and other visualizations that summarize thousands of lines of data. You should have experience in translating performance media metrics into coherent, digestible reports for client ad campaigns and be comfortable communicating via Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.
Strategy: You’ll be responsible for learning our clients’ businesses and aligning their media strategy with business goals as well as understanding advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to help guide media buying strategy. With a background in paid media and/or digital advertising, you understand concepts like LTV, ROAS and Incremental Revenue and are able to be engaged in discussions with clients to gain trust and shareholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.
