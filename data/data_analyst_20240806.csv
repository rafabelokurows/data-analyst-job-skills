About Us

""LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We are looking for a Software or Data Engineer that is experienced in high performance Python data processing libraries (often referred to as the Composable Data Stack). You will collaborate directly with our CTO and be part of the core product team.

dlt is an open-source library that automatically creates datasets from messy, unstructured data sources. You can use the library to move data from about anywhere into the most well-known SQL and vector stores, data lakes, storage buckets, or local engines such as DuckDB, Arrow or delta-rs. The library automates many cumbersome data engineering tasks and can be handled by anyone who knows Python. You can see more details in this Hacker News article.

dltHub is based in Berlin and New York City. It was founded by data and machine learning veterans. We are backed by Foundation Capital, Dig Ventures, and many technical founders from companies such as Datadog, Instana, Hugging Face, MotherDuck, Mesosphere, Matillion, Miro, and Rasa.

Your Tasks and Responsibilities:

dlt is a missing part between traditional Modern Data Stack and the emerging Pythonic Composable Data Stack: a gateway that creates datasets which the other components can then process. Our mission is to integrate dlt fully with this new, emerging ecosystem in a way that our users love. This means we respect their time, effort and previous investments in modern data stack when designing features. To support this mission your tasks and responsibilities include:


You design and implement OSS features that make dlt a gateway to composable data stack: integrating query engines, transformation frameworks, table formats with our library
You listen to our users, always paying attention to what they need to go to production with dlt
You work with our customers in commercial projects where dlt is combined with existing ""modern data stack"" infrastructure
You maintain the open source project with the team (e.g., review PRs, resolve issues, talk with community contributors, etc.)



Requirements

Who You Are

If you are fascinated by the emerging ecosystem of data libraries in Python, which allows you to do on a single machine what until recently was possibly only in the cloud - then you'll enjoy working with us.


You know what duckdb, arrow, datafusion, lancedb, delta-rs, ibis, pyiceberg, sqlglot, kedro, hamilton and similar Python libraries / pip installable components do and know when to apply them
You have experience in building data apps or product based on composable data stack
... or you were contributing code to any (or similar) of projects above
You know what so called ""Modern Data Stack"" is and appreciate certain aspects of it (ie. maturity, fitting into enterprise workflows etc.)
... and in fact you are interested in combining both worlds
You really like Python and are fluent in writing Python code (e.g., Python typing, unit testing, writing docstrings, etc.)
You have a degree in computer science, data science, or other equivalent experience
You are familiar with GitHub workflows (e.g., pull requests, code reviews, CI/CD services, etc.)


Nice to Have:


You are based in Berlin and willing to work in our office regularly
You have a hacker nature and you love to make things optimized
Experience with DevOps (e.g., CI systems like GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP/Digital Ocean, etc.)
Experience with machine learning (e.g., the toolset, the workflows, practical applications, etc.)



Benefits

What do we offer

In our work culture, we value each other's autonomy and efficiency. We have set hours for communication and deep work. We like automation, so we automate our work before we automate the work of others.


We are an office-first company but give you plenty of opportunities for deep work and work from home. Dedicated ""no meeting days"" to help the team focus on their most impactful work
As we work often from the Berlin office, we cover your public transportation ticket
We are deeply committed to your personal and professional growth, so we have an annual budget for learning and development
We offer regular subsidized team lunches and Urban Sports Club membership
We also have an ESOP plan for employees, depending on their role and dedication. We provide an option to increase your ESOP if you grow with us.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Klue is a VC backed, capital-efficient high growth SaaS company. Tiger Global and Salesforce Ventures led our US$62m Series B in the fall of 2021. We’re creating the category of competitive enablement: helping companies understand their market and outmaneuver their competition. We benefit from having an experienced leadership team working alongside several hundred risk-taking builders who elevate every day.

We’re one of Canada’s Most Admired Corporate Cultures by Waterstone HC, a Deloitte Technology Fast 50 & Fast 500 winner, and recipient of both the Startup of the Year and Tech Culture of the Year awards at the Technology Impact Awards.

We’re growing and currently looking to add a Data Analyst Intern to our team.

This internship will span several functions of the Insights department and will give you a broad view of what it takes to run an innovative SaaS company. Klue is a very collaborative company where we believe in the value that can be unlocked by sharing data insights across departments and clients - you'll be getting a full picture of how a SaaS company on a rocketship trajectory operates. You’ll have many opportunities to listen in on strategic conversations and will be encouraged to ask questions along the way. As the company grows, we will have many roles to fill within the Insights department and would hope the right candidate would consider returning one day.

As a data analyst intern, you will be focused on helping our insights team ensure our data providers and outsourced content creators are delivering accurate data to their end-users.

The Data team's scope covers data validation for existing sources, outsourced content, and new potential data sources. As the data marketplace is always evolving, you will also be involved in broader projects across the team.

This is You:


Highly analytical and critical thinker
Ability to digest and communicate complex data
You like ambiguity and thrive in fast-paced environments
You have experience with Excel and/or Python
You like to learn new things and are keen to become an expert


Bonus points for...


Experience with analytics platforms, data cleaning initiatives, data gathering.


What you'll be measured on:


Ability to identify trends in data sets and develop unique solutions.
Efficiency in data gathering and data cleaning.


How We Work


Hybrid. Best of both worlds (remote & in-office)
Our main Canadian hubs are in Vancouver and Toronto, and most of our teams are located in EST and PST.
You and your team will be in office at least 2 days per week.


⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️

Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.
