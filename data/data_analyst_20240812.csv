Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Gusto is seeking dedicated, empathetic, and experienced Staff Data Analysts with extensive experience (ideally 7 years or more) in applying their expertise in a business environment. As a Staff Data Analyst, you will play a crucial role in leveraging data to drive strategic decision-making and contribute to our organization's overall success. The ideal candidate is a talented data storyteller with a thoughtful analytical mindset, excellent SQL skills, dedication to keeping data accurate and documented, an eye for data visualization design, and a passion for helping small businesses thrive.

In This Role, You Will


Own ambiguous problems and interact with multiple stakeholders, establish structure and process to take our analytics to the next level.
Data Thought Partnership: Collaborate with product managers, engineering leads, designers, and operations teams to drive data efforts for large product areas. Help identify what is working, discover growth opportunities, and evaluate data that informs key decisions.
Data Analysis: Collect, clean, and analyze data to extract meaningful insights and identify trends, patterns, and correlations relevant to our business, products, and services.
Reporting and Visualization: Develop and maintain dashboards, reports, and visualizations to effectively communicate key findings and trends to stakeholders.
Performance Tracking: Monitor and evaluate the performance of our products and services, conducting regular data-driven reviews and providing actionable recommendations for improvement.
Influence: Work closely with other members of our Data Team - Data Science, Analytics Engineering, and Data Platform - to promote a data-informed mindset across the company through education and role modeling.
Builder Mindset: Be responsive, build and iterate quickly, take ownership of the data needs and opportunities in your area, stay curious, and produce data products that help the business.


What We're Looking For


Successful applicants typically have between 7-10 years of experience at a product-focused software company.
Experience working with and analyzing complex datasets, including QA, querying, summarizing, visualizing, and reporting findings.
Excellent SQL skills with demonstrated ability to write efficient queries.
Excellent project management skills.
Excellent communication skills, capable of effectively delivering findings and recommendations to non-technical stakeholders in a clear and compelling manner.
Data Modeling: Collaborate with the data engineering team to design and implement data models that facilitate data analysis, reporting, and business intelligence needs.
Data Quality Assurance: Ensure data integrity and accuracy by conducting regular data audits, identifying and resolving data quality issues, and implementing data governance best practices.
Business Insights: Collaborate with cross-functional teams, including product managers and business strategists, to provide data-driven insights and support decision-making processes.


If you are passionate about using data to drive strategic decisions and help small businesses thrive, we'd love to hear from you!

Our cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at $133,000-$177,000/yr in Denver, Austin, Miami, Chicago and Atlanta, $145,000-$194,000/year in Los Angeles, $161,000-$209,000/yr for San Francisco, Seattle and New York. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including candidate experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above.

Gusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco, and New York City. Employees who are based in those locations will be expected to work from the office on designated days approximately 2-3 days per week (or more depending on role). The same office expectations apply to all Symmetry roles, Gusto's subsidiary, whose physical office is in Scottsdale.

Note: The San Francisco office expectations encompass both the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas.

When approved to work from a location other than a Gusto office, a secure, reliable, and consistent internet connection is required.

Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Gusto.

About TikTok U.S. Data Security
TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. U.S. Data Security (“USDS”) is a subsidiary of TikTok in the U.S. This new, security-first division was created to bring heightened focus and governance to our data protection policies and content assurance protocols to keep U.S. users safe. Our focus is on providing oversight and protection of the TikTok platform and U.S. user data, so millions of Americans can continue turning to TikTok to learn something new, earn a living, express themselves creatively, or be entertained. The teams within USDS that deliver on this commitment daily span across Trust & Safety, Security & Privacy, Engineering, User & Product Ops, Corporate Functions and more.

Why Join Us
Creation is the core of TikTok's purpose. Our platform is built to help imaginations thrive. This is doubly true of the teams that make TikTok possible.
Together, we inspire creativity and bring joy - a mission we all believe in and aim towards achieving every day.
To us, every challenge, no matter how difficult, is an opportunity; to learn, to innovate, and to grow as one team. Status quo? Never. Courage? Always.
At TikTok, we create together and grow together. That's how we drive impact - for ourselves, our company, and the communities we serve.

The USDS-Platform and Community Integrity (PaCI) team is missioned to: - Protect U.S. TikTok users, including and beyond content consumers, creators, and advertisers; - Secure platform health and community experience authenticity; - Build infrastructures, platforms, and technologies, as well as to collaborate with many cross-functional teams and stakeholders.

Our challenges are not some regular day-to-day technical puzzles -- You'll be part of a team that's developing novel solutions to first-seen challenges of a non-stop evolution of a phenomenal product eco-system. The work needs to be fast, transferrable, while still down to the ground to make quick and solid differences.
