Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will


Work with the capital market, finance, engineering and credit risk teams to support usage monitoring and deep-dive analysis for Capital product, which provides access to users for fast, flexible financing
Develop highly-visible dashboards and automated reporting related to key performance metrics for lending, such as delinquency/loss rate and IRR
Support ongoing investor communications, investor reporting and information requests on loan portfolio
Understand and leverage the data assets of Stripe to analyze investor performance/portfolio stratifications for existing and new lending products
Work with unstructured data to develop insights and recommendations
Collaborate with data scientists to apply loss forecasting model to generate cohort loss expectation and analyze the factors impacting investment performance, and quantify the impacts from backtesting on historical loan performance



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirement


Must be located in either New York or Chicago given this is an in office based role
3 - 5 years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Risk Analysis roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.
Experience in analytics in banking, FinTech, or investment management



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or FinTech company, on credit risk analysis and portfolio management.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We hold true to our core values: innovation in everything we do, passion & excellence in every area, individual empowerment, initiative and ownership, and teamwork over ego. At Lucid, we value diversity and are dedicated to creating an environment and culture that is respectful and inclusive for everyone. Lucid is a hybrid workplace. We promote a healthy work-life balance by allowing employees to work remotely, from one of our offices, or a combination of the two depending on the needs of the role and team.

Since the company’s founding, Lucid Software has received numerous global and regional recognitions for its products, business, and workplace culture. These include being named a Fortune Best Workplace in Technology and a 2022 Glassdoor Best Place to Work, inclusion on the Forbes Cloud 100, and ranking in the top 100 on G2’s 2023 Best Global Software Companies. Top businesses use our products all around the world, including customers such as Google, GE, and NBC Universal. Our partners include industry leaders such as Google, Atlassian, and Microsoft.

In today’s tech environment, strategic thinking must be paired with strong analytical skills. As an Analyst on Lucid’s Strategy & Analytics team, you will be expected to be fluent in all aspects of strategic problem solving - from identifying opportunities to analyzing data, presenting results, and driving change. This role is designed for candidates who are excited to dive deep into data and passionate about problem solving.

Analysts on the Strategy & Analytics team support groups across the whole business, allowing you to see multiple sides of the business and expand your knowledge and experience. These groups include Marketing, Demand Generation, Go-To-Market Operations, Customer Experience, Product, Finance, and Strategy. The tool sets developed and used are similar across these functions, but each presents domain-specific challenges that will provide unique opportunities for learning.

Some examples of past projects from our team include creating a customer health score to highlight at-risk accounts, identifying opportunities to accelerate product adoption at enterprise companies, creating tools to automate the analysis of A/B tests, finding ways to increase collaboration and virality of our product, and building dashboards to help sales reps target high-potential accounts.

Although your day-to-day work will be with the function to which you are assigned, you will be well-supported by the rest of the Strategy & Analytics team. While we are distributed throughout the company, we maintain close ties by holding weekly team trainings, daily working sessions, and regular team activities. We help each other whenever possible, and with the collective efforts of the full team, there’s rarely a question we can’t answer.

Responsibilities


Work with senior leaders and other stakeholders within various departments at Lucid
Identify and understand problems and opportunities
Construct and present data-driven recommendations
Implement new initiatives that help grow the business
Create and maintain SQL data models that encode business domain logic for analysis, building visualizations, and dashboarding


Requirements


Completed Bachelor's degree, ideally in a technical or quantitative field
Proficient with SQL
Basic understanding of statistics and hypothesis testing
Great communication skills, both written and verbal
Able to think strategically and tackle open-ended problems
Detail-oriented, organized, and a good team player


Preferred Qualifications

This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location.

Restaurants are the heart of our communities - where we go to celebrate life’s memorable moments with those we love, and find comfort and familiarity in the world. But while the digital and data revolutions have transformed other parts of commerce and hospitality, restaurants haven’t had the same opportunity. The result has been an industry that’s - on average - had their profit margins shrink by 5x over the past 20 years.




Bikky was founded on the belief that restaurants deserve the same access to data as the largest, most sophisticated businesses in the world. We believe that data can fundamentally transform the economic model of the entire restaurant industry - producing better businesses, more jobs, and stronger communities.




Bikky is based in New York City and has raised over $15 million in funding to date, most recently with a Series A in Q4 2023. We’re proud to serve thousands of restaurant locations across the U.S., including major brands like Bojangles, MOD Pizza, Dave’s Hot Chicken, and Long John Silver’s. 




About the role




As a Data Analyst, you’ll act as the bridge between our customers and our product. You’ll support customers through their journey adopting Bikky - starting from onboarding their data all the way to leveraging it for sophisticated analyses. You’ll be a key stakeholder in making sure that our customers understand Bikky’s insights and that we become a core part of their critical decision making processes. Unlike data roles that focus on internal analyses, at Bikky you’ll work across the entire restaurant industry - helping brands use their data to solve their hardest business challenges. 




From a technical perspective, you’ll have the opportunity to contribute throughout our entire data stack. A typical day might include everything from updating a DBT model to support a new customer’s needs, to performing an analysis on customer retention. You'll collaborate closely with our product and engineering teams to refine and enhance our data tools based on real-world customer feedback. Long term, there’s an opportunity to grow into a product development, data engineering, or data science role depending on where you’d like to take your career. 




About you




Our data roles are unique; they’re product and customer facing, rather than internal facing. To meet that challenge, we’re looking for candidates with a multidisciplinary skillset. In our interview process we’ll look for analysis experience, business sense, and interpersonal skills.




The ideal candidate will have: 

1-3 years of experience working with data
Fluency in SQL, experience with DBT a bonus 
Experience in a business facing or customer facing analytical role 
Strong statistical skills
Excellent verbal and written communication




This is a great role for candidates early in their careers or transitioning into data from a business role. That said, we want to talk with exceptional candidates from any background. If you feel you’re a great fit for the role, please reach out even if you don’t meet all of the points above. 




Why us




At Bikky, you’ll work on challenging problems that matter to real businesses while tackling industry leading technical challenges. Our DBT + Snowflake implementation is in the top ~1% of industry-wide sophistication and we grapple with novel data engineering, analytical, and product problems every day. Alongside challenging work, you’ll have the support of a fully Senior and Staff level team. You’ll be the first non-senior level hire and we’re deeply committed to making sure you’ll be successful. You’ll have the opportunity to accelerate your career by working alongside some of the best in the industry. 




Perks and Benefits

$100,000 - $140,000 annual salary 
Generous equity compensation
Top tier (for stage) health insurance including medical, vision, and dental 
Ability to participate in a 401k
Bikky offers a hybrid working environment. For candidates in New York City, we have an office where teammates can opt to work 2-3 times per week.
Flexible vacation policy
