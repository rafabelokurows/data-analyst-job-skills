Hast du Lust, mit Goal100 die Energiewende zu beschleunigen? Bist du begeistert von Windenergie? Hast du Erfahrung im Bereich Data Analytics? Dann bist du bei uns genau richtig!

Bei Goal100 arbeiten wir gemeinsam mit verschiedenen Partner:innen daran, den Ausbau der Windkraft an Land voranzutreiben. Unser Projekt wurde von einer engagierten Gruppe von Gründer:innen, Digitalexperten, Medienschaffenden, Wissenschaftler:innen und Aktivist:innen ins Leben gerufen.

Das erwartet dich

Bei Goal100 erwartet dich ein dynamisches Umfeld, in dem wir fest an die transformative Kraft von Daten und Teamarbeit glauben. Unsere Arbeit dreht sich um den Umgang mit Daten, in denen wir den Schlüssel für Veränderung sehen - und für Beschleunigung. Wir setzen auf die Beteiligung aller Akteure, um gemeinsam Großes zu erreichen.

In dieser Position beschäftigst du dich mit verschiedenen Datenquellen, vom Auslesen, über Cleansing bis zur Auswertung und Interpretation. Auch Aufgaben aus dem Bereich Data Engineering können in Frage kommen.

Unsere Positionen sind flexibel gestaltet und orientieren sich stark an den individuellen Stärken und Interessen unserer Teammitglieder. Flexibilität und Offenheit für neue Themen und Verantwortlichkeiten sind daher bei uns sehr willkommen, ebenso wie die Bereitschaft, neue Fähigkeiten zu entwickeln. Wir als Team und als Organisation unterstützen und fördern aktiv den Willen, Verantwortung zu übernehmen und Neues zu lernen.

Dein Profil

Wir suchen ein motiviertes und flexibles Teammitglied, das Freude am Lösen komplexer Probleme hat.


Mindestens 2 Jahre Erfahrung im Bereich Data Analytics: Du kannst eigenständig Datenbanken auslesen, große Datenmengen auswerten, diese visualisieren, und Insights daraus ableiten
Du bist vertraut mit der Verarbeitung und Bereinigung von (un-)strukturierten Daten und kannst Daten aus verschiedenen Quellen in ein gemeinsames tabellarisches Format konsolidieren
Du hast fundierte Python-Kenntnisse, Erfahrung im Umgang mit Paketen wie pandas, numpy, matplotlib und kannst deinen Code in ausführbare Skripte umwandeln. Du nutzt GitHub zur gemeinsamen Kollaboration und Versionskontrolle
Du hast einen gut bis sicheren Umgang mit relationalen Datenbanken (PostgreSQL) und SQL und bist bewandert in der Nutzung von Python-Bibliotheken zur Interaktion mit Datenbanken (SQLAlchemy, Psycopg2)
Die Ergebnisse deiner datengetriebenen Analysen stellst du in anschaulichen und verständlichen Visualisierungen dar (bspw. in Python oder Tableau), sodass komplexe Zusammenhänge, Trends und spannende Insights entnommen werden können.
Du hast Spaß daran, deine Arbeit im Team vorzustellen und deine Erkenntnisse gemeinsam weiterzuentwickeln
Vorteilhaft ist es, wenn Du Dich mit der Nutzung von Workflow-Orchestration Tools (prefect, Airflow), Container-Software zur Reproduzierbarkeit und Migration von Pipeline-Systemen und Cloud-Strukturen zum Hosten von Daten-Pipelines auskennst und grundlegende Methoden des Software-Engineering wie Code-Refactoring, Packaging und Objekt-orientiertes Programmieren anzuwenden weist


Hast Du bereits Erfahrungen im Bereich Erneuerbare Energien im Allgemeinen oder Windkraft im Speziellen gesammelt? Oder Kenntnisse in der Handhabung von Geodaten? Umso besser! Von Vorteil sind außerdem Kenntnisse im Bereich Umwelt- und Raumplanung. Wenn nicht, mach' dir keine Sorgen und bewirb dich trotzdem.

Was wir Dir bieten


Gehalt nach einem transparenten und gemeinschaftlich entwickelten Gehaltsmodell

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

We are looking for a Data Analyst that is passionate about metrics and telling the stories behind the data. We have several roles open across different teams (grocery, loyalty, restaurants). Data Analysts at Deliveroo report into our data science management team.

You will be a professional in insights storytelling, communication and visualisation and know how to create action from metrics. Crafting effective intelligent benchmarks, understanding performance, caring about data quality, enabling automation and creating phenomenal visualisations and stories are things that drive you.

What you'll be doing



Work closely with commercial stakeholders to create value and business impact through better data availability, visualisation and analysis
Discover, analyse, and interpret trends or patterns in complex datasets to perform ad-hoc analyses and deliver insights to the executive team and senior management
Understand key drivers of the business and provide data driven guidance on key levers
Identify and specify data needs and quality requirements and work closely with Analytics Engineers to ensure data is available, accurate and corresponds to the business needs
Consolidate and distribute best analytical practices from different teams and countries



Requirements



Experience identifying the root cause of problems, assessing risks/impacts and determining and implementing effective solutions.
A good understanding of querying in SQL and understanding of database structure - you'll be expected to be able to extract the data you need for your analysis.
Compelling story-telling skills, and an eye for powerful visualisations - you'll need to translate your findings for all levels of stakeholder (business and technical)
Good knowledge of Excel/GSheets - depending on the task, there is a good chance that this is where some of your exploratory analysis will take place. Being comfortable with pivot tables and functions will be essential.
Developer experience with a data visualisation tool (Looker, Tableau, Periscope)

Allica is the UK’s fastest growing company - and the fastest-growing financial technology (fintech) firm ever. Our purpose is to help established SMEs, one of the last major underserved opportunities in fintech. Established SMEs are the backbone of local communities - representing over a third of our economy - yet have been largely neglected both by traditional high street banks and modern fintech providers




Role Description

Data is a key asset to Allica and is deeply embedded in all our teams and products. With data, we assist and work with Finance, Operations, Credit Risk, Product and management. This role will be for the Lending Tribe.




We are looking for ambitious and curious people who can help us understand our data better, contribute to facilitating the discussions between engineering and the data stakeholders and have an impact on the business by telling stories around the insights they generate.




You will be an integral part of the lending data squad, and the initial focus will be scaling up our ability to deliver analytics/insights that shape our understanding of the business and enhancing our foundations for automated reporting




Principal Accountabilities

Understand our products and processes through the data we have or collect
Work with the Lending Tribe and other stakeholders (Ops, risk, etc) to understand their data needs and provide solutions that address the core need (not just the immediate request)
Contribute meaningful insights from our data that proactively drive decisions and new lines of inquiry
Build visualizations and reports that enable the Lending business to service their ongoing data needs and measure KPIs
Develop data knowledge base (definitions, working rhythms etc.) within the team that enables us to become an information hub for the business




Personal Attributes & Experience

Previous experience working as a data analyst (in finance is desirable but not essential)
You like to investigate and challenge narratives using data
The ability to write queries in SQL with logic to combine multiple data sources
You work well with stakeholders across the business.
You communicate effectively and are comfortable with learning how to translate technical detail into business and commercial language.
You have a solid foundation in Python programming OR a strong desire to learn




Don’t tick every box?

Don’t worry if you don’t have all the skills or requirements listed on the job description. If you think you’ll be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you!




Flexible working

We know the ‘9-to-5’ isn’t right for everyone. That’s why Allica Bank is fully committed to flexible and hybrid working. Please let us know what is best for you and, if we can, we will do our best to accommodate.




Diversity

We’re a diverse bunch here at Allica, with all kinds of experiences, backgrounds and lifestyles. Our openness and differences make us stronger, and we want everybody to feel comfortable bringing as much of themselves to work with them as they like.

Full-time /

Hybrid



About Octopus Electroverse

We’re making electric vehicle ownership as smart and as simple as possible, by building the giant, virtual charging platform of the future.

In just over 3 years, Octopus Electroverse has grown to become one of the largest eMobility players in Europe, with over 750,000 connected electric vehicle chargers and a customer ecosystem spanning web, iOS, Android, CarPlay, Android Auto & Automotive OS, and more.

But it’s just the start: we’re busy expanding internationally, working with more automotive and tech partners, building exciting new features at scale, and creating the integrated charging experiences of the future - all in the name of making public EV charging super simple for customers.

Electroverse is a multifunctional team made up of product, development, commercial, operations, marketing, partnerships and more - all focused together on making Octopus the go-to name in EV charging. And we’re looking for smart individuals with an interest in the space who can help us make it happen.

We're looking for a Data Analyst to join the Data Team within Electroverse.

This role offers a chance to contribute to the data solutions that will drive the electrification of transport. The role involves working with diverse datasets, from charge point locations and usage to marketing campaigns, sales, and operations data.

The ideal person will be passionate about leveraging data to provide insights and improve efficiency across various teams. You’ll need to be great at listening, understanding challenges and formulating pragmatic solutions.

This is a fantastic opportunity to help build out a small but growing team within the business; create processes and automation pipelines and help shape the framework for how the business will handle data going forward.

What You'll Do...


Develop Data and Automation Tools: Create tools to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the Electroverse product and processes.
Maintain Data Tools: Build, maintain, and support data tools, including managing the dbt codebase, building BI dashboards, and developing data.
Data Product Development: Develop new data products to offer key insights to external customers.
Conduct Analyses and Reconciliations: Perform one-off analyses and reconciliations using SQL, Python, and Jupyter notebooks.
Support Non-Technical Teams: Assist internal teams in accessing and utilising data more effectively, building tools for a non-technical audience and potentially providing technical coaching and training.
Collaborate Across Teams: Work closely with colleagues from Partnerships, Marketing, Operations, Engineering, and Finance within Electroverse and the broader Octopus Energy Group.



What You'll Have...


Data Modelling Experience: Proficiency in using dbt (ideally) for data modelling
Dashboard and Data Product Development: Experience in creating data dashboards and developing data products.
Collaborative Projects: Experience working on collaborative projects with business teams and familiarity with agile or similar methodologies.
Autonomous Problem-Solving: Ability to work independently, scope problems, and deliver pragmatic solutions.
Data Lifecycle Expertise: Versatility in handling the entire data lifecycle, from ingestion to visualisation and presentation.
Tool Building: Passion for creating robust and usable tools to enhance team efficiency.
Data Analysis Skills: Proficiency in SQL, python, pandas/numpy, Databricks/Jupyter Notebooks, and experience with large datasets in production environments.
Curiosity and Drive: Self-motivated with a strong desire to learn and improve.
Time Management: Ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously in a fast-paced environment.
Passion for Net Zero: You don’t need to be deeply familiar with the EV market and products (we can teach that), but a passion for the transition to net zero is an excellent start



What We Work With...


dbt for data modelling
Databricks Delta Lake for data lake and warehouse storage and querying
Python as our main programming language
Jupyter and Jupyter Hub for notebook analytics and collaboration
Circle CI for continuous deployment
AWS cloud infrastructure
Kubernetes for data services and task orchestration
Google Analytics, Amplitude and Firebase for client applications event processing
Airflow for job scheduling and tracking
Parquet and Delta file formats on S3 for data lake storage
Streamlit for data applications



We would prefer someone who can work in our London office 1/2 times a week and you will also need to have full working rights for the UK as we are unable to sponsor.

If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!

Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute.

We stand up for individuality. We actively foster an inclusive workplace where diversity and individual difference are valued and leveraged to achieve the agency’s vision. And most importantly we value every individual’s wellbeing.

As a diversity champion, equal opportunities and disability confident employer and an ardent advocate of flexible working we understand that everyone has unique requirements and needs.

We are a global creative agency, but the individual really is at the heart of everything we do. We use data to find out what makes them tick. We use technology to talk to them one-to-one – but to one million at a time. And we use creativity to encourage them to engage, click, buy and bond, again and again.

Each brand is unique and has its own individual challenges. We pride ourselves in rising to each and every one of them, for brands such as KFC, Mercedes Benz, IKEA, Paypal and Virgin Media 02.

Us

In order to foster collaboration and relationships, our hybrid model requires three office days per week. As equal opportunities proponents, we are open to discuss any hybrid working related needs during the initial screening.

Learning and Development is important. We all know that. Its why we have a dedicated Learning and Development team and offer regular career conversations and bespoke L&D programmes so that you can leave us with more than when you started.

We recognise that the work of diversity, equity and inclusion calls on all of us. That’s why we set up The Neighbourhood. A collective of people, at different stages of the DE&I journey, whether impacted or allies, dedicated to helping our colleagues take ownership and effect change across 4 key pillars; Anti-racism, Disability, Gender & LGBTQ+ and Parents & Carers.

The Health and Wellbeing of our people matters immensely. We offer Coaching opportunities for all through our partnerships with Sanctus (mental health partner who provides online coaching; you can talk about anything, personal or professional) and Sayge (1:1 professional development coaching program). We have 40 trained Mental Health First Aiders across the agency and have Babylon Health (Private GP service) for all.

You’re better at work when you feel better in yourself. So, in addition to your annual holiday, you can take a “Me” day and an “Us” day, every year. Your “Me” day is for you to invest in yourself – go after a life goal, meditate, learn to paint, bake cakes or just have a duvet day watching Netflix!

Your “Us” day is all about giving back and helping others – volunteer, pick litter at a local park, hang out with the elderly or raise money for a local charity.

We’re progressive and always open to new initiatives, for example we’ve recently partnered with Fertifa (Leading Fertility and Reproductive Health benefit providers). Because we know the journey to becoming a family isn’t always easy (that includes men too), and we support our people through that journey whether you are new parent, experiencing the menopause, or anything else in between.

Whatever stage of life you are at, we make sure you have the tools you need to have a healthy work life balance.

US MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

Your Role

In the Data Analytics team you will ensure both the voice of the customer and CFO are represented in the room with hard evidence. As well as supporting exceptional customer experiences using data, you will help ensure every action we take is directly improving performance against your clients objectives.

As an Analyst, you will work under supervision to deliver projects within set deadlines, utilising your strong hands on analytical capabilities. Your strengths in Python and SQL will ensure you can efficiently deliver robust analytics with guidance from your team.

Your experience with web and social analytics tools (GA / Adobe / Brandwatch / Sprinklr) and data visualisation tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker / etc) will enable you to uncover key insights across channels and create self-service dashboards.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.




To achieve this mission, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.




For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.




A few examples of your responsibilities

Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.




What we look for

Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.




What we offer

Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of €52,246. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.




Commitment & contract

Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time.




Location

Milan (Italy) or fully remote.




Before you apply

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We’re extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don’t hesitate to apply.




The selection process

We welcome applications in English and Italian. If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.




Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested at accommodations-ext@bendingspoons.com.




Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

What you’ll be doingSitting within this modern data environment, in a growing team and industry, you’ll be helping customers who struggle to get fair car insurance; people who have immigrated to the UK and struggle to drive here for the first time; and then you’ll be helping the company to retain those customers.

They’re hiring across three different teams and are considering candidates for different areas of the business; whether it be looking at customer and insurance fraud; customer segmentation and acquisitions; or insurance claims analysis; they’re hoping to grow in different areas.

This company have rapidly grown since their founding, having become profitable in the last few years and going from ‘start-up’ to ‘scale-up’, there is now no stopping them. Data has been important to them from the get-go, meaning they see the value of this – and their data teams – resulting in a modern data environment.

Please note there is a requirement of two days a week in the office in London and therefore we require someone within a commutable distance to commit to this.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.




To achieve this mission, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.




For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.




A few examples of your responsibilities

Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.




What we look for

Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.




What we offer

Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of €52,246. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.

Octopus Electroverse (eMobility) ⚡ – Data /

Full-time /

Hybrid



About Octopus Electroverse

We’re making electric vehicle ownership as smart and as simple as possible, by building the giant, virtual charging platform of the future.

In just over 3 years, Octopus Electroverse has grown to become one of the largest eMobility players in Europe, with over 750,000 connected electric vehicle chargers and a customer ecosystem spanning web, iOS, Android, CarPlay, Android Auto & Automotive OS, and more.

But it’s just the start: we’re busy expanding internationally, working with more automotive and tech partners, building exciting new features at scale, and creating the integrated charging experiences of the future - all in the name of making public EV charging super simple for customers.

Electroverse is a multifunctional team made up of product, development, commercial, operations, marketing, partnerships and more - all focused together on making Octopus the go-to name in EV charging. And we’re looking for smart individuals with an interest in the space who can help us make it happen.

We're looking for a Data Analyst to join the Data Team within Electroverse.

This role offers a chance to contribute to the data solutions that will drive the electrification of transport. The role involves working with diverse datasets, from charge point locations and usage to marketing campaigns, sales, and operations data.

The ideal person will be passionate about leveraging data to provide insights and improve efficiency across various teams. You’ll need to be great at listening, understanding challenges and formulating pragmatic solutions.

This is a fantastic opportunity to help build out a small but growing team within the business; create processes and automation pipelines and help shape the framework for how the business will handle data going forward.

What You'll Do...


Develop Data and Automation Tools: Create tools to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the Electroverse product and processes.
Maintain Data Tools: Build, maintain, and support data tools, including managing the dbt codebase, building BI dashboards, and developing data.
Data Product Development: Develop new data products to offer key insights to external customers.
Conduct Analyses and Reconciliations: Perform one-off analyses and reconciliations using SQL, Python, and Jupyter notebooks.
Support Non-Technical Teams: Assist internal teams in accessing and utilising data more effectively, building tools for a non-technical audience and potentially providing technical coaching and training.
Collaborate Across Teams: Work closely with colleagues from Partnerships, Marketing, Operations, Engineering, and Finance within Electroverse and the broader Octopus Energy Group.



What You'll Have...


Data Modelling Experience: Proficiency in using dbt (ideally) for data modelling
Dashboard and Data Product Development: Experience in creating data dashboards and developing data products.
Collaborative Projects: Experience working on collaborative projects with business teams and familiarity with agile or similar methodologies.
Autonomous Problem-Solving: Ability to work independently, scope problems, and deliver pragmatic solutions.
Data Lifecycle Expertise: Versatility in handling the entire data lifecycle, from ingestion to visualisation and presentation.
Tool Building: Passion for creating robust and usable tools to enhance team efficiency.
Data Analysis Skills: Proficiency in SQL, python, pandas/numpy, Databricks/Jupyter Notebooks, and experience with large datasets in production environments.
Curiosity and Drive: Self-motivated with a strong desire to learn and improve.
Time Management: Ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously in a fast-paced environment.
Passion for Net Zero: You don’t need to be deeply familiar with the EV market and products (we can teach that), but a passion for the transition to net zero is an excellent start



What We Work With...


dbt for data modelling
Databricks Delta Lake for data lake and warehouse storage and querying
Python as our main programming language
Jupyter and Jupyter Hub for notebook analytics and collaboration
Circle CI for continuous deployment
AWS cloud infrastructure
Kubernetes for data services and task orchestration
Google Analytics, Amplitude and Firebase for client applications event processing
Airflow for job scheduling and tracking
Parquet and Delta file formats on S3 for data lake storage
Streamlit for data applications



We would prefer someone who can work in our London office 1/2 times a week and you will also need to have full working rights for the UK as we are unable to sponsor.

If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!

Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.

We stand up for individuality. We actively foster an inclusive workplace where diversity and individual difference are valued and leveraged to achieve the agency’s vision. And most importantly we value every individual’s wellbeing.

As a diversity champion, equal opportunities and disability confident employer and an ardent advocate of flexible working we understand that everyone has unique requirements and needs.

We are a global creative agency, but the individual really is at the heart of everything we do. We use data to find out what makes them tick. We use technology to talk to them one-to-one – but to one million at a time. And we use creativity to encourage them to engage, click, buy and bond, again and again.

Each brand is unique and has its own individual challenges. We pride ourselves in rising to each and every one of them, for brands such as KFC, Mercedes Benz, IKEA, Paypal and Virgin Media 02.

Us

In order to foster collaboration and relationships, our hybrid model requires three office days per week. As equal opportunities proponents, we are open to discuss any hybrid working related needs during the initial screening.

Learning and Development is important. We all know that. Its why we have a dedicated Learning and Development team and offer regular career conversations and bespoke L&D programmes so that you can leave us with more than when you started.

We recognise that the work of diversity, equity and inclusion calls on all of us. That’s why we set up The Neighbourhood. A collective of people, at different stages of the DE&I journey, whether impacted or allies, dedicated to helping our colleagues take ownership and effect change across 4 key pillars; Anti-racism, Disability, Gender & LGBTQ+ and Parents & Carers.

The Health and Wellbeing of our people matters immensely. We offer Coaching opportunities for all through our partnerships with Sanctus (mental health partner who provides online coaching; you can talk about anything, personal or professional) and Sayge (1:1 professional development coaching program). We have 40 trained Mental Health First Aiders across the agency and have Babylon Health (Private GP service) for all.

You’re better at work when you feel better in yourself. So, in addition to your annual holiday, you can take a “Me” day and an “Us” day, every year. Your “Me” day is for you to invest in yourself – go after a life goal, meditate, learn to paint, bake cakes or just have a duvet day watching Netflix!

Your “Us” day is all about giving back and helping others – volunteer, pick litter at a local park, hang out with the elderly or raise money for a local charity.

We’re progressive and always open to new initiatives, for example we’ve recently partnered with Fertifa (Leading Fertility and Reproductive Health benefit providers). Because we know the journey to becoming a family isn’t always easy (that includes men too), and we support our people through that journey whether you are new parent, experiencing the menopause, or anything else in between.

Whatever stage of life you are at, we make sure you have the tools you need to have a healthy work life balance.

US MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

Your Role

In the Data Analytics team you will ensure both the voice of the customer and CFO are represented in the room with hard evidence. As well as supporting exceptional customer experiences using data, you will help ensure every action we take is directly improving performance against your clients objectives.

As an Analyst, you will work under supervision to deliver projects within set deadlines, utilising your strong hands on analytical capabilities. Your strengths in Python and SQL will ensure you can efficiently deliver robust analytics with guidance from your team.

Your experience with web and social analytics tools (GA / Adobe / Brandwatch / Sprinklr) and data visualisation tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker / etc) will enable you to uncover key insights across channels and create self-service dashboards.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

          <strong>About Rapp<br><br></strong>We stand up for individuality. We actively foster an inclusive workplace where diversity and individual difference are valued and leveraged to achieve the agency’s vision. And most importantly we value every individual’s wellbeing.<br><br>As a diversity champion, equal opportunities and disability confident employer and an ardent advocate of flexible working we understand that everyone has unique requirements and needs.<br><br>We are a global creative agency, but the individual really is at the heart of everything we do. We use data to find out what makes them tick. We use technology to talk to them one-to-one – but to one million at a time. And we use creativity to encourage them to engage, click, buy and bond, again and again.<br><br>Each brand is unique and has its own individual challenges. We pride ourselves in rising to each and every one of them, for brands such as KFC, Mercedes Benz, IKEA, Paypal and Virgin Media 02.<br><br><strong>Us<br><br></strong>In order to foster collaboration and relationships, our hybrid model requires three office days per week. As equal opportunities proponents, we are open to discuss any hybrid working related needs during the initial screening.<br><br>Learning and Development is important. We all know that. Its why we have a dedicated Learning and Development team and offer regular career conversations and bespoke L&amp;D programmes so that you can leave us with more than when you started.<br><br>We recognise that the work of diversity, equity and inclusion calls on all of us. That’s why we set up The Neighbourhood. A collective of people, at different stages of the DE&amp;I journey, whether impacted or allies, dedicated to helping our colleagues take ownership and effect change across 4 key pillars; Anti-racism, Disability, Gender &amp; LGBTQ+ and Parents &amp; Carers.<br><br>The Health and Wellbeing of our people matters immensely. We offer Coaching opportunities for all through our partnerships with Sanctus (mental health partner who provides online coaching; you can talk about anything, personal or professional) and Sayge (1:1 professional development coaching program). We have 40 trained Mental Health First Aiders across the agency and have Babylon Health (Private GP service) for all.<br><br>You’re better at work when you feel better in yourself. So, in addition to your annual holiday, you can take a “Me” day and an “Us” day, every year. Your “Me” day is for you to invest in yourself – go after a life goal, meditate, learn to paint, bake cakes or just have a duvet day watching Netflix!<br><br>Your “Us” day is all about giving back and helping others – volunteer, pick litter at a local park, hang out with the elderly or raise money for a local charity.<br><br>We’re progressive and always open to new initiatives, for example we’ve recently partnered with Fertifa (Leading Fertility and Reproductive Health benefit providers). Because we know the journey to becoming a family isn’t always easy (that includes men too), and we support our people through that journey whether you are new parent, experiencing the menopause, or anything else in between.<br><br>Whatever stage of life you are at, we make sure you have the tools you need to have a healthy work life balance.<br><br><strong>US MARKETING SCIENCES<br><br></strong>The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

A day in the life of a Capital One Data Analyst.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making. As a Data Analyst at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and agony in their financial lives.

Responsibilities:


Writing SQL to clean, transform, investigate data.
Working closely with business partners to harness the power of data in compliance testing.

Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in un-mined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

This opportunity will present you with the ability to make a profound impact on Stripe Crypto product, which supports online crypto business with scalable fiat payment APIs. As a data analyst here, you will work with money-movement, treasury and the crypto business team, to analyze the data on the blockchain, and to increase conversion and reduce fraud at every step of the payment flow. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems, and develop highly-visible dashboards and automated reporting related to key performance metrics for our crypto product.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirement


Must be located in New York given this is a New York based role
3 - 6+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or crypto company, and experience in analytics on blockchain data.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Job Summary

This individual is a member of the Vaccine Evaluation Center (VEC) whose primary role is to provide consultation to Investigators in the identification of data, and on data collection processes and study outcome on multiple studies as dictated by study protocols. The position coordinates the tasks performed by the data team and involves supervision of the data team. These studies have varying levels of complexities requiring an overall understanding of the data structures and programming.

Organizational Status

Exercises data management judgement (including non-routine) and is accountable for own directed actions. Makes judgements as to how the decision fits with acceptable Good Clinical Data Management Practices and what the impact of the decision will be. Reports to Senior Data Manager of the VEC.

Work Performed

Development of highly-specialized case report forms (CRFs) for each study. The project team consists of the investigator(s), field administrators, study coordinator, statistician and data coordinator who decide what information is required for a study and how it will be collected. Using this information, the data coordinator will formulate the CRF that will encompass all the needs of the study and maintain good clinical data management practise guidelines. The investigator(s) have final approval of the CRFs. Each study is faced with unique issues and the data coordinator must research and evaluate appropriate uses of data collection tools, usage of words in questions and style of questions. The data coordinator is continually evaluating the CRFs and accompanying user’s manual to ensure that the best possible tools are provided for the study.

The data coordinator is responsible for designing and implementing systems for organizing and managing the flow of data from the field through data management to analysis and to long term storage. This requires good organizational skills as there can be 15-20 different studies in progress and at different stages. In addition, data is received from many different sites across Canada in multi-centre clinical trials, which adds to the complexity of the job. This individual supervises the work of the data entry and data monitoring staff. This involves training and monitoring staff, reviewing workload assignments and adjusting schedules to reflect changes and priorities within the VEC.

The data coordinator manages the data throughout the course of each study ensuring that all work performed by study staff adheres to policies and standards. The data coordinator is responsible for maintenance of the database until study completion. Upon meeting all requirements for clean data, the database is given to the Statistician. Each study and sponsor have different needs making each study unique. The individual must be adaptable to the needs of each study to ensure good clinical data management practices are maintained.

Databases (both routine and complex) are custom designed and maintained by the data coordinator. This requires an in-depth working knowledge of software being used and keeping abreast of software changes as they occur. Maintaining and upgrading of the databases forms part of the duties.

Works in conjunction with the statistician to develop descriptive aggregate statistics for data cleanup and ensure that final statistical programme incorporates data management decisions during the study.

When necessary, provides basic statistical programming support as per pre-defined analysis plan.

The data coordinator is responsible for the long-term storage of VEC data that conforms to government set standards. The data coordinator needs to keep up with changes in the technology and acceptable practices.

Consequence of Error/Judgement

Errors in judgement can result in significant damage to the Vaccine Evaluation Center’s academic reputation as a centre of excellence, nationally and internationally. Poorly designed databases can result in higher study costs because of extra time spent dealing with data entry, data management and data analysis. Poorly designed databases can also result in making it difficult to perform effective data analysis affecting the overall science of the study. Ineffective training of data staff has budgetary and human resource implications. The systems to organize and manage the flow of data that are not appropriately designed can lead to financial problems as well as problems with conforming to good clinical data management guidelines.

Supervision Received

Receives general directions from project team leader(s) and the investigator(s) as part of the specified project team for study related issues. Study related work is reviewed by the Senior Data Manager.

Supervision Given

Supervises the data staff, a group that includes up to 8 research assistants and data monitoring staff. This includes assigning and monitoring the work, training staff and participating in job evaluation/performance measures. Works with the statistician to coordinate the flow and priority setting of the data and the analysis. Works with the field administrator(s) to ensure the efficient flow of data from the field to the data team and to coordinate workload of research assistant staff.

Job Summary

This individual is a member of the Vaccine Evaluation Center (VEC) whose primary role is to provide consultation to Investigators in the identification of data, and on data collection processes and study outcome on multiple studies as dictated by study protocols. The position coordinates the tasks performed by the data team and involves supervision of the data team. These studies have varying levels of complexities requiring an overall understanding of the data structures and programming.

Organizational Status

Exercises data management judgement (including non-routine) and is accountable for own directed actions. Makes judgements as to how the decision fits with acceptable Good Clinical Data Management Practices and what the impact of the decision will be. Reports to Senior Data Manager of the VEC.

Work Performed

Development of highly-specialized case report forms (CRFs) for each study. The project team consists of the investigator(s), field administrators, study coordinator, statistician and data coordinator who decide what information is required for a study and how it will be collected. Using this information, the data coordinator will formulate the CRF that will encompass all the needs of the study and maintain good clinical data management practise guidelines. The investigator(s) have final approval of the CRFs. Each study is faced with unique issues and the data coordinator must research and evaluate appropriate uses of data collection tools, usage of words in questions and style of questions. The data coordinator is continually evaluating the CRFs and accompanying user’s manual to ensure that the best possible tools are provided for the study.

The data coordinator is responsible for designing and implementing systems for organizing and managing the flow of data from the field through data management to analysis and to long term storage. This requires good organizational skills as there can be 15-20 different studies in progress and at different stages. In addition, data is received from many different sites across Canada in multi-centre clinical trials, which adds to the complexity of the job. This individual supervises the work of the data entry and data monitoring staff. This involves training and monitoring staff, reviewing workload assignments and adjusting schedules to reflect changes and priorities within the VEC.

The data coordinator manages the data throughout the course of each study ensuring that all work performed by study staff adheres to policies and standards. The data coordinator is responsible for maintenance of the database until study completion. Upon meeting all requirements for clean data, the database is given to the Statistician. Each study and sponsor have different needs making each study unique. The individual must be adaptable to the needs of each study to ensure good clinical data management practices are maintained.

Databases (both routine and complex) are custom designed and maintained by the data coordinator. This requires an in-depth working knowledge of software being used and keeping abreast of software changes as they occur. Maintaining and upgrading of the databases forms part of the duties.

Works in conjunction with the statistician to develop descriptive aggregate statistics for data cleanup and ensure that final statistical programme incorporates data management decisions during the study.

When necessary, provides basic statistical programming support as per pre-defined analysis plan.

The data coordinator is responsible for the long-term storage of VEC data that conforms to government set standards. The data coordinator needs to keep up with changes in the technology and acceptable practices.

Consequence of Error/Judgement

Errors in judgement can result in significant damage to the Vaccine Evaluation Center’s academic reputation as a centre of excellence, nationally and internationally. Poorly designed databases can result in higher study costs because of extra time spent dealing with data entry, data management and data analysis. Poorly designed databases can also result in making it difficult to perform effective data analysis affecting the overall science of the study. Ineffective training of data staff has budgetary and human resource implications. The systems to organize and manage the flow of data that are not appropriately designed can lead to financial problems as well as problems with conforming to good clinical data management guidelines.

Supervision Received

Receives general directions from project team leader(s) and the investigator(s) as part of the specified project team for study related issues. Study related work is reviewed by the Senior Data Manager.

Supervision Given

Supervises the data staff, a group that includes up to 8 research assistants and data monitoring staff. This includes assigning and monitoring the work, training staff and participating in job evaluation/performance measures. Works with the statistician to coordinate the flow and priority setting of the data and the analysis. Works with the field administrator(s) to ensure the efficient flow of data from the field to the data team and to coordinate workload of research assistant staff.

Minimum Qualifications

Willingness to respect diverse perspectives, including perspectives in conflict with one’s own
Demonstrates a commitment to enhancing one’s own awareness, knowledge, and skills related to equity, diversity, and inclusion


Preferred Qualifications

University degree in Computer Science is strongly recommended with additional courses in the Health Care Field desired. Related experience in data management of clinical trials with preference for vaccine trials is required. Minimum 2 years supervisory skills.

Skills

Demonstrated knowledge of web-based clinical data management software. Experience in SAS® statistical software is required. Ability to perform advanced programming. Demonstrated information management skills are required. Ability to communicate effectively verbally and in writing. Proven problem solving, analytical and decision making skills. Ability to maintain accuracy and attention to detail. Ability to work effectively independently and in a team environment.
