Hast du Lust, mit Goal100 die Energiewende zu beschleunigen? Bist du begeistert von Windenergie? Hast du Erfahrung im Bereich Data Analytics? Dann bist du bei uns genau richtig!

Bei Goal100 arbeiten wir gemeinsam mit verschiedenen Partner:innen daran, den Ausbau der Windkraft an Land voranzutreiben. Unser Projekt wurde von einer engagierten Gruppe von Gründer:innen, Digitalexperten, Medienschaffenden, Wissenschaftler:innen und Aktivist:innen ins Leben gerufen. Goal100 wird von Google.org mitfinanziert und von ProjectTogether geführt und gehostet. Mach mit und gestalte die Zukunft der Energiewende aktiv mit!

Das erwartet dich

Bei Goal100 erwartet dich ein dynamisches Umfeld, in dem wir fest an die transformative Kraft von Daten und Teamarbeit glauben. Unsere Arbeit dreht sich um den Umgang mit Daten, in denen wir den Schlüssel für Veränderung sehen - und für Beschleunigung. Wir setzen auf die Beteiligung aller Akteure, um gemeinsam Großes zu erreichen.

In dieser Position beschäftigst du dich mit verschiedenen Datenquellen, vom Auslesen, über Cleansing bis zur Auswertung und Interpretation. Auch Aufgaben aus dem Bereich Data Engineering können in Frage kommen.

Unsere Positionen sind flexibel gestaltet und orientieren sich stark an den individuellen Stärken und Interessen unserer Teammitglieder. Flexibilität und Offenheit für neue Themen und Verantwortlichkeiten sind daher bei uns sehr willkommen, ebenso wie die Bereitschaft, neue Fähigkeiten zu entwickeln. Wir als Team und als Organisation unterstützen und fördern aktiv den Willen, Verantwortung zu übernehmen und Neues zu lernen.

Dein Profil

Wir suchen ein motiviertes und flexibles Teammitglied, das Freude am Lösen komplexer Probleme hat.


Mindestens 2 Jahre Erfahrung im Bereich Data Analytics: Du kannst eigenständig Datenbanken auslesen, große Datenmengen auswerten, diese visualisieren, und Insights daraus ableiten
Du bist vertraut mit der Verarbeitung und Bereinigung von (un-)strukturierten Daten und kannst Daten aus verschiedenen Quellen in ein gemeinsames tabellarisches Format konsolidieren
Du hast fundierte Python-Kenntnisse, Erfahrung im Umgang mit Paketen wie pandas, numpy, matplotlib und kannst deinen Code in ausführbare Skripte umwandeln. Du nutzt GitHub zur gemeinsamen Kollaboration und Versionskontrolle
Du hast einen gut bis sicheren Umgang mit relationalen Datenbanken (PostgreSQL) und SQL und bist bewandert in der Nutzung von Python-Bibliotheken zur Interaktion mit Datenbanken (SQLAlchemy, Psycopg2)
Die Ergebnisse deiner datengetriebenen Analysen stellst du in anschaulichen und verständlichen Visualisierungen dar (bspw. in Python oder Tableau), sodass komplexe Zusammenhänge, Trends und spannende Insights entnommen werden können.
Du hast Spaß daran, deine Arbeit im Team vorzustellen und deine Erkenntnisse gemeinsam weiterzuentwickeln
Vorteilhaft ist es, wenn Du Dich mit der Nutzung von Workflow-Orchestration Tools (prefect, Airflow), Container-Software zur Reproduzierbarkeit und Migration von Pipeline-Systemen und Cloud-Strukturen zum Hosten von Daten-Pipelines auskennst und grundlegende Methoden des Software-Engineering wie Code-Refactoring, Packaging und Objekt-orientiertes Programmieren anzuwenden weist


Hast Du bereits Erfahrungen im Bereich Erneuerbare Energien im Allgemeinen oder Windkraft im Speziellen gesammelt? Oder Kenntnisse in der Handhabung von Geodaten? Umso besser! Von Vorteil sind außerdem Kenntnisse im Bereich Umwelt- und Raumplanung. Wenn nicht, mach' dir keine Sorgen und bewirb dich trotzdem.

Was wir Dir bieten


Gehalt nach einem transparenten und gemeinschaftlich entwickelten Gehaltsmodell
Ein motiviertes, extrem engagiertes Team
Hohe Flexibilität - Home-Office ebenso möglich wie regelmäßige Arbeit im ProjectTogether Office in Berlin-Mitte
Persönliche Weiterentwicklung als integrales Ziel deiner Arbeit, das durch individuelle Betreuung und dedizierte Weiterbildungszeit- und budget unterstützt wird
30 Urlaubstage
Finanzielle Unterstützung bei Deiner betrieblichen Altersvorsorge
Zuschuss zu Deiner Urban Sports-Mitgliedschaft und die Mitgliedschaft bei nilo.health – eine Plattform, um Deine mentale Gesundheit am Arbeitsplatz zu stärken.
Zusammenarbeit in einem freundlichen Team mit ehrlicher Feedback- und Development-Kultur, das sich leidenschaftlich für die Energiewende einsetzt

Das erwartet dich

Bei Goal100 erwartet dich ein dynamisches Umfeld, in dem wir fest an die transformative Kraft von Daten und Teamarbeit glauben. Unsere Arbeit dreht sich um den Umgang mit Daten, in denen wir den Schlüssel für Veränderung sehen - und für Beschleunigung. Wir setzen auf die Beteiligung aller Akteure, um gemeinsam Großes zu erreichen.

In dieser Position beschäftigst du dich mit verschiedenen Datenquellen, vom Auslesen, über Cleansing bis zur Auswertung und Interpretation. Auch Aufgaben aus dem Bereich Data Engineering können in Frage kommen.

Unsere Positionen sind flexibel gestaltet und orientieren sich stark an den individuellen Stärken und Interessen unserer Teammitglieder. Flexibilität und Offenheit für neue Themen und Verantwortlichkeiten sind daher bei uns sehr willkommen, ebenso wie die Bereitschaft, neue Fähigkeiten zu entwickeln. Wir als Team und als Organisation unterstützen und fördern aktiv den Willen, Verantwortung zu übernehmen und Neues zu lernen.

Dein Profil

Wir suchen ein motiviertes und flexibles Teammitglied, das Freude am Lösen komplexer Probleme hat.


Mindestens 2 Jahre Erfahrung im Bereich Data Analytics: Du kannst eigenständig Datenbanken auslesen, große Datenmengen auswerten, diese visualisieren, und Insights daraus ableiten
Du bist vertraut mit der Verarbeitung und Bereinigung von (un-)strukturierten Daten und kannst Daten aus verschiedenen Quellen in ein gemeinsames tabellarisches Format konsolidieren
Du hast fundierte Python-Kenntnisse, Erfahrung im Umgang mit Paketen wie pandas, numpy, matplotlib und kannst deinen Code in ausführbare Skripte umwandeln. Du nutzt GitHub zur gemeinsamen Kollaboration und Versionskontrolle
Du hast einen gut bis sicheren Umgang mit relationalen Datenbanken (PostgreSQL) und SQL und bist bewandert in der Nutzung von Python-Bibliotheken zur Interaktion mit Datenbanken (SQLAlchemy, Psycopg2)
Die Ergebnisse deiner datengetriebenen Analysen stellst du in anschaulichen und verständlichen Visualisierungen dar (bspw. in Python oder Tableau), sodass komplexe Zusammenhänge, Trends und spannende Insights entnommen werden können.
Du hast Spaß daran, deine Arbeit im Team vorzustellen und deine Erkenntnisse gemeinsam weiterzuentwickeln
Vorteilhaft ist es, wenn Du Dich mit der Nutzung von Workflow-Orchestration Tools (prefect, Airflow), Container-Software zur Reproduzierbarkeit und Migration von Pipeline-Systemen und Cloud-Strukturen zum Hosten von Daten-Pipelines auskennst und grundlegende Methoden des Software-Engineering wie Code-Refactoring, Packaging und Objekt-orientiertes Programmieren anzuwenden weist


Hast Du bereits Erfahrungen im Bereich Erneuerbare Energien im Allgemeinen oder Windkraft im Speziellen gesammelt? Oder Kenntnisse in der Handhabung von Geodaten? Umso besser!

We are looking for a Data Analyst that is passionate about metrics and telling the stories behind the data. We have several roles open across different teams (grocery, loyalty, restaurants). Data Analysts at Deliveroo report into our data science management team.

You will be a professional in insights storytelling, communication and visualisation and know how to create action from metrics.

Work closely with commercial stakeholders to create value and business impact through better data availability, visualisation and analysis
Discover, analyse, and interpret trends or patterns in complex datasets to perform ad-hoc analyses and deliver insights to the executive team and senior management

A good understanding of querying in SQL and understanding of database structure - you'll be expected to be able to extract the data you need for your analysis.
Compelling story-telling skills, and an eye for powerful visualisations - you'll need to translate your findings for all levels of stakeholder (business and technical)
Good knowledge of Excel/GSheets - depending on the task, there is a good chance that this is where some of your exploratory analysis will take place. Being comfortable with pivot tables and functions will be essential.
Developer experience with a data visualisation tool (Looker, Tableau, Periscope)

Allica is the UK’s fastest growing company - and the fastest-growing financial technology (fintech) firm ever. Our purpose is to help established SMEs, one of the last major underserved opportunities in fintech. Established SMEs are the backbone of local communities - representing over a third of our economy - yet have been largely neglected both by traditional high street banks and modern fintech providers




Role Description

Data is a key asset to Allica and is deeply embedded in all our teams and products. With data, we assist and work with Finance, Operations, Credit Risk, Lending and management.




We are looking for ambitious and curious people who can help us understand our data better, contribute to facilitating the discussions between engineering and the data stakeholders and have an impact on the business by telling stories around the insights they generate.




You will be an integral part of the lending data squad, and the focus will be scaling up our ability to deliver analytics/insights and managing stakeholder interactions to support ongoing data needs




Principal Accountabilities

Understand our products and processes through the data we have or collect
Work with the Lending Tribe and other stakeholders (Ops, risk, etc) to understand their data needs and provide solutions that address the core need (not just the immediate requests).
Contribute meaningful insights from our data that proactively drive decisions and new lines of inquiry
Build visualizations and reports that enable the Lending business to service their ongoing data needs and measure KPIs
Develop data knowledge base (definitions, working rhythms etc.) within the team that enables us to become an information hub for the business
Helping us implement a data-driven mindset in the company by promoting a metrics-based approach to new initiatives (opportunity sizing prior and success metrics post deployment)




Personal Attributes & Experience

Previous experience working as a data analyst
You prefer to think through how to build an interesting analytics function at a company (rather than fit into existing conventions)
The ability to write queries in SQL with logic to combine multiple data sources
You work well with stakeholders across the business.
You communicate effectively and are comfortable with learning how to translate technical detail into business and commercial language.
You have a solid foundation in Python programming OR a strong desire to learn
Prior experience working in Google Cloud Platform and using Looker is desirable (but not at all necessary)




Don’t tick every box?

Don’t worry if you don’t have all the skills or requirements listed on the job description. If you think you’ll be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you!




Flexible working

We know the ‘9-to-5’ isn’t right for everyone. That’s why Allica Bank is fully committed to flexible and hybrid working. Please let us know what is best for you and, if we can, we will do our best to accommodate.




Diversity

We’re a diverse bunch here at Allica, with all kinds of experiences, backgrounds and lifestyles. Our openness and differences make us stronger, and we want everybody to feel comfortable bringing as much of themselves to work with them as they like.




Additional Information

Working at Allica Bank

At Allica Bank we want to ensure our employees have the right tools and environment in which to succeed in their role and in support of our customers.

Our employees are at the heart of everything we do, so our benefits are designed with you in mind:

Full onboarding support and continued development opportunities
Options for flexible working
Regular social activities
25 days holiday – with the option to Buy/Sell
Pension contributions
Discretionary bonus scheme

Our long-established client, based in the heart of the City of London, has created a new Investment Data Analyst position to deliver timely data and reporting to a collaborative and supportive front office team. The Investment Team is at the forefront of the market, dedicated to delivering excellence and sustainability across a wide range of asset classes, from vanilla bonds to hedge funds, private markets to direct property.




In this newly created role, you will establish and develop reporting and analytics for the front office, providing detailed insights into the investment management business. Collaborating with the investment team, including Responsible Investing, you will build an array of reporting and analytics to answer key questions around portfolio management, scheme and fund performance, investment risk, climate, and ESG data for example.




You will lead the migration of analytics data into the cloud, construct data models, and enhance data extractions from providers using APIs and flat files. Proficiency in Excel, including VBA, is essential. While prior experience with Power BI, Charles River, or Barra is not required, a solid understanding of data warehousing and advanced Excel skills are highly desirable.




You will engage with external asset managers to streamline data collection and develop import templates for accurate data integration. As a data steward, you will ensure data accuracy within third-party systems and take ownership of resolving data issues to improve quality. Although this is a newly created role, there is existing reporting that requires rationalisation, and plenty of opportunities to develop more insightful reporting for the front office.




In return, this fast-growing boutique firm offers a small, dynamic environment where the front office and middle office are seamlessly integrated. This provides enormous scope to learn, take on strategic projects, and drive the business forward.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

A day in the life of a Capital One Data Analyst.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making. As a Data Analyst at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and agony in their financial lives.

Responsibilities:


Writing SQL to clean, transform, investigate data.
Working closely with business partners to harness the power of data in compliance testing.
Designing rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas.

Supporting and consulting with the business to propagate data management best practices.
Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of digital banking and the financial world of tomorrow.

Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.

Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity and encourages creative solutions to problems. All new engineers deploy working code their first week, and we strive to broaden individual impact with support from managers, mentors, and teams.

Are you strongly driven by a passion for data analysis, complex problem-solving, and designing business intelligence solutions? As a Business Intelligence Analyst at Yelp, you’ll work with partners and stakeholders across the company — including our Executive Leadership, Finance, BizOps, Product, Data Science, Data Engineering, Marketing, and People teams — to provide relevant data and visualization for key business decisions.

Yelp's Business Intelligence team is dedicated to empowering Yelp's leadership and analytics teams with trusted and reusable data visualizations, data warehousing products, and BI platform support. The work of our team continuously evolves with the company’s needs and is critical to Yelp’s data-driven decision making.

Contribute to data strategy for data warehousing, reporting, dashboards, and self-service analytics.
Exercise advanced knowledge of SQL to extract critical information and business value from data spread across multiple databases and data formats.
Provide training and ongoing support to business users on business intelligence products.


What It Takes To Succeed


Ideally 3 years of experience in business intelligence or as a business systems analyst, data analyst/developer or similar role.
Experience with data visualization tools (Tableau preferred).
Experience documenting business and technical requirements and directly interacting with engineers on business intelligence projects.
Excellent collaboration, communication, negotiation, and presentation skills.
Working knowledge of statistics and KPIs (LTV, Churn, etc.).
Advanced SQL skills and experience writing complex queries.
Knowledge and working experience with dimensional data modeling.


What You'll Get


Compensation range is $82,000-230,000 annually. Depending on your role and level, you may also be offered a bonus, restricted stock units, and benefits.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

This opportunity will present you with the ability to make a profound impact on Stripe Crypto product, which supports online crypto business with scalable fiat payment APIs. As a data analyst here, you will work with money-movement, treasury and the crypto business team, to analyze the data on the blockchain, and to increase conversion and reduce fraud at every step of the payment flow. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems, and develop highly-visible dashboards and automated reporting related to key performance metrics for our crypto product.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirement


Must be located in New York given this is a New York based role
3 - 6+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or crypto company, and experience in analytics on blockchain data.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

What We Do

Provincial Laboratory Medicine Services (PLMS) provides laboratory testing at 31 sites across the lower mainland and central coast of BC, including acute care hospital laboratories and specialty laboratories.

PLMS is part of the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA).

The Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) plans, manages and evaluates specialized health services with the BC health authorities to provide equitable and cost-effective health care for people throughout the province. Our values reflect our commitment to excellence and include: Respect people – Be compassionate – Dare to innovate – Cultivate partnerships – Serve with purpose.

The Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) plans, manages and evaluates specialized health services with the BC health authorities to provide equitable and cost-effective health care for people throughout the province.
