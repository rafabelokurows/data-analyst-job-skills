At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

We are looking for a Data Analyst that is passionate about metrics and telling the stories behind the data. We have several roles open across different teams (grocery, loyalty, restaurants). Data Analysts at Deliveroo report into our data science management team.

You will be a professional in insights storytelling, communication and visualisation and know how to create action from metrics. Crafting effective intelligent benchmarks, understanding performance, caring about data quality, enabling automation and creating phenomenal visualisations and stories are things that drive you.

What you'll be doing



Work closely with commercial stakeholders to create value and business impact through better data availability, visualisation and analysis
Discover, analyse, and interpret trends or patterns in complex datasets to perform ad-hoc analyses and deliver insights to the executive team and senior management
Understand key drivers of the business and provide data driven guidance on key levers
Identify and specify data needs and quality requirements and work closely with Analytics Engineers to ensure data is available, accurate and corresponds to the business needs
Consolidate and distribute best analytical practices from different teams and countries



Requirements



Experience identifying the root cause of problems, assessing risks/impacts and determining and implementing effective solutions.
A good understanding of querying in SQL and understanding of database structure - you'll be expected to be able to extract the data you need for your analysis.
Compelling story-telling skills, and an eye for powerful visualisations - you'll need to translate your findings for all levels of stakeholder (business and technical)
Good knowledge of Excel/GSheets - depending on the task, there is a good chance that this is where some of your exploratory analysis will take place. Being comfortable with pivot tables and functions will be essential.
Developer experience with a data visualisation tool (Looker, Tableau, Periscope)

Analytics is the compass that guides Sephora on its strategic journey, and we are on the lookout for a Data Analyst who can harness the power of data to propel our business forward.

Allica is the UK’s fastest growing company - and the fastest-growing financial technology (fintech) firm ever. Our purpose is to help established SMEs, one of the last major underserved opportunities in fintech. Established SMEs are the backbone of local communities - representing over a third of our economy - yet have been largely neglected both by traditional high street banks and modern fintech providers




Role Description

Data is a key asset to Allica and is deeply embedded in all our teams and products. With data, we assist and work with Finance, Operations, Credit Risk, Product and management. This role will be for the Lending Tribe.




We are looking for ambitious and curious people who can help us understand our data better, contribute to facilitating the discussions between engineering and the data stakeholders and have an impact on the business by telling stories around the insights they generate.




You will be an integral part of the lending data squad, and the initial focus will be scaling up our ability to deliver analytics/insights that shape our understanding of the business and enhancing our foundations for automated reporting




Principal Accountabilities

Understand our products and processes through the data we have or collect
Work with the Lending Tribe and other stakeholders (Ops, risk, etc) to understand their data needs and provide solutions that address the core need (not just the immediate request)
Contribute meaningful insights from our data that proactively drive decisions and new lines of inquiry
Build visualizations and reports that enable the Lending business to service their ongoing data needs and measure KPIs
Develop data knowledge base (definitions, working rhythms etc.) within the team that enables us to become an information hub for the business




Personal Attributes & Experience

Previous experience working as a data analyst (in finance is desirable but not essential)
You like to investigate and challenge narratives using data
The ability to write queries in SQL with logic to combine multiple data sources
You work well with stakeholders across the business.
You communicate effectively and are comfortable with learning how to translate technical detail into business and commercial language.
You have a solid foundation in Python programming OR a strong desire to learn




Don’t tick every box?

Don’t worry if you don’t have all the skills or requirements listed on the job description. If you think you’ll be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you!




Flexible working

We know the ‘9-to-5’ isn’t right for everyone. That’s why Allica Bank is fully committed to flexible and hybrid working. Please let us know what is best for you and, if we can, we will do our best to accommodate.




Diversity

We’re a diverse bunch here at Allica, with all kinds of experiences, backgrounds and lifestyles. Our openness and differences make us stronger, and we want everybody to feel comfortable bringing as much of themselves to work with them as they like.




Additional Information

Our employees are at the heart of everything we do, so our benefits are designed with you in mind:

About The Agency

OmniGov is a specialist division created to handle UK Government media buying, the largest advertiser in the UK, and a top 10 UK agency in its own right, handling over 80 very different government departments. We were originally awarded the four year contract in 2018 and late 2021 we became the first agency ever to retain the business for the next 4 years.

Our ambition is to be the best Government Media Buying service in the world, intelligently using media to deliver public services. In doing so we want to lead the industry in the UK and be one of the best places to work and learn in the media sector. In fact, we have been Campaign’s Agency Team of the Year for the last 3 years.

Our team of c.150 people are passionate about delivering better outcomes for the public sector. Why? This is taxpayers’ money we are dealing with, and the outcomes of these campaigns really do matter. Effectiveness is the driving factor. You will work on campaigns that can represent the most profoundly challenging issues in our society aiming to help, improve or save lives. At other times they simply aim to inform the public. But at all times they matter. To people across the UK and beyond, to us, our families and our own communities.

We are organised across different client hubs themed by government priority nationally, regionally and internationally.

Our core teams and expertise encompass Account Management, Effectiveness & Evaluation, Implementation Planning and Media Activation across all channels.

Working for OmniGOV is different to other jobs in the media agency sector. Working with government can be challenging, dynamic and demands the highest standards, but above all it is important work and rewarding. We believe there is no better place to learn and grow in the industry.

We stand up for individuality. We actively foster an inclusive workplace where diversity and individual difference are valued and leveraged to achieve the agency’s vision. And most importantly we value every individual’s wellbeing.

As a diversity champion, equal opportunities and disability confident employer and an ardent advocate of flexible working we understand that everyone has unique requirements and needs.

We are a global creative agency, but the individual really is at the heart of everything we do. We use data to find out what makes them tick. We use technology to talk to them one-to-one – but to one million at a time. And we use creativity to encourage them to engage, click, buy and bond, again and again.

Each brand is unique and has its own individual challenges. We pride ourselves in rising to each and every one of them, for brands such as KFC, Mercedes Benz, IKEA, Paypal and Virgin Media 02.

Us

In order to foster collaboration and relationships, our hybrid model requires three office days per week. As equal opportunities proponents, we are open to discuss any hybrid working related needs during the initial screening.

Learning and Development is important. We all know that. Its why we have a dedicated Learning and Development team and offer regular career conversations and bespoke L&D programmes so that you can leave us with more than when you started.

We recognise that the work of diversity, equity and inclusion calls on all of us. That’s why we set up The Neighbourhood. A collective of people, at different stages of the DE&I journey, whether impacted or allies, dedicated to helping our colleagues take ownership and effect change across 4 key pillars; Anti-racism, Disability, Gender & LGBTQ+ and Parents & Carers.

The Health and Wellbeing of our people matters immensely. We offer Coaching opportunities for all through our partnerships with Sanctus (mental health partner who provides online coaching; you can talk about anything, personal or professional) and Sayge (1:1 professional development coaching program). We have 40 trained Mental Health First Aiders across the agency and have Babylon Health (Private GP service) for all.

You’re better at work when you feel better in yourself. So, in addition to your annual holiday, you can take a “Me” day and an “Us” day, every year. Your “Me” day is for you to invest in yourself – go after a life goal, meditate, learn to paint, bake cakes or just have a duvet day watching Netflix!

Your “Us” day is all about giving back and helping others – volunteer, pick litter at a local park, hang out with the elderly or raise money for a local charity.

We’re progressive and always open to new initiatives, for example we’ve recently partnered with Fertifa (Leading Fertility and Reproductive Health benefit providers). Because we know the journey to becoming a family isn’t always easy (that includes men too), and we support our people through that journey whether you are new parent, experiencing the menopause, or anything else in between.

Whatever stage of life you are at, we make sure you have the tools you need to have a healthy work life balance.

US MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

Your Role

In the Data Analytics team you will ensure both the voice of the customer and CFO are represented in the room with hard evidence. As well as supporting exceptional customer experiences using data, you will help ensure every action we take is directly improving performance against your clients objectives.

As an Analyst, you will work under supervision to deliver projects within set deadlines, utilising your strong hands on analytical capabilities. Your strengths in Python and SQL will ensure you can efficiently deliver robust analytics with guidance from your team.

Your experience with web and social analytics tools (GA / Adobe / Brandwatch / Sprinklr) and data visualisation tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker / etc) will enable you to uncover key insights across channels and create self-service dashboards.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

We stand up for individuality. We actively foster an inclusive workplace where diversity and individual difference are valued and leveraged to achieve the agency’s vision. And most importantly we value every individual’s wellbeing.

As a diversity champion, equal opportunities and disability confident employer and an ardent advocate of flexible working we understand that everyone has unique requirements and needs.

We are a global creative agency, but the individual really is at the heart of everything we do. We use data to find out what makes them tick. We use technology to talk to them one-to-one – but to one million at a time. And we use creativity to encourage them to engage, click, buy and bond, again and again.

Each brand is unique and has its own individual challenges. We pride ourselves in rising to each and every one of them, for brands such as KFC, Mercedes Benz, IKEA, Paypal and Virgin Media 02.

Us

In order to foster collaboration and relationships, our hybrid model requires three office days per week. As equal opportunities proponents, we are open to discuss any hybrid working related needs during the initial screening.

Learning and Development is important. We all know that. Its why we have a dedicated Learning and Development team and offer regular career conversations and bespoke L&D programmes so that you can leave us with more than when you started.

We recognise that the work of diversity, equity and inclusion calls on all of us. That’s why we set up The Neighbourhood. A collective of people, at different stages of the DE&I journey, whether impacted or allies, dedicated to helping our colleagues take ownership and effect change across 4 key pillars; Anti-racism, Disability, Gender & LGBTQ+ and Parents & Carers.

The Health and Wellbeing of our people matters immensely. We offer Coaching opportunities for all through our partnerships with Sanctus (mental health partner who provides online coaching; you can talk about anything, personal or professional) and Sayge (1:1 professional development coaching program). We have 40 trained Mental Health First Aiders across the agency and have Babylon Health (Private GP service) for all.

You’re better at work when you feel better in yourself. So, in addition to your annual holiday, you can take a “Me” day and an “Us” day, every year. Your “Me” day is for you to invest in yourself – go after a life goal, meditate, learn to paint, bake cakes or just have a duvet day watching Netflix!

Your “Us” day is all about giving back and helping others – volunteer, pick litter at a local park, hang out with the elderly or raise money for a local charity.

We’re progressive and always open to new initiatives, for example we’ve recently partnered with Fertifa (Leading Fertility and Reproductive Health benefit providers). Because we know the journey to becoming a family isn’t always easy (that includes men too), and we support our people through that journey whether you are new parent, experiencing the menopause, or anything else in between.

Whatever stage of life you are at, we make sure you have the tools you need to have a healthy work life balance.

US MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

Your Role

In the Data Analytics team you will ensure both the voice of the customer and CFO are represented in the room with hard evidence. As well as supporting exceptional customer experiences using data, you will help ensure every action we take is directly improving performance against your clients objectives.

As an Analyst, you will work under supervision to deliver projects within set deadlines, utilising your strong hands on analytical capabilities. Your strengths in Python and SQL will ensure you can efficiently deliver robust analytics with guidance from your team.

Your experience with web and social analytics tools (GA / Adobe / Brandwatch / Sprinklr) and data visualisation tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker / etc) will enable you to uncover key insights across channels and create self-service dashboards.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

          <strong>About Rapp<br><br></strong>We stand up for individuality. We actively foster an inclusive workplace where diversity and individual difference are valued and leveraged to achieve the agency’s vision. And most importantly we value every individual’s wellbeing.<br><br>As a diversity champion, equal opportunities and disability confident employer and an ardent advocate of flexible working we understand that everyone has unique requirements and needs.<br><br>We are a global creative agency, but the individual really is at the heart of everything we do. We use data to find out what makes them tick. We use technology to talk to them one-to-one – but to one million at a time. And we use creativity to encourage them to engage, click, buy and bond, again and again.<br><br>Each brand is unique and has its own individual challenges. We pride ourselves in rising to each and every one of them, for brands such as KFC, Mercedes Benz, IKEA, Paypal and Virgin Media 02.<br><br><strong>Us<br><br></strong>In order to foster collaboration and relationships, our hybrid model requires three office days per week. As equal opportunities proponents, we are open to discuss any hybrid working related needs during the initial screening.<br><br>Learning and Development is important. We all know that. Its why we have a dedicated Learning and Development team and offer regular career conversations and bespoke L&amp;D programmes so that you can leave us with more than when you started.<br><br>We recognise that the work of diversity, equity and inclusion calls on all of us. That’s why we set up The Neighbourhood. A collective of people, at different stages of the DE&amp;I journey, whether impacted or allies, dedicated to helping our colleagues take ownership and effect change across 4 key pillars; Anti-racism, Disability, Gender &amp; LGBTQ+ and Parents &amp; Carers.<br><br>The Health and Wellbeing of our people matters immensely. We offer Coaching opportunities for all through our partnerships with Sanctus (mental health partner who provides online coaching; you can talk about anything, personal or professional) and Sayge (1:1 professional development coaching program). We have 40 trained Mental Health First Aiders across the agency and have Babylon Health (Private GP service) for all.<br><br>You’re better at work when you feel better in yourself. So, in addition to your annual holiday, you can take a “Me” day and an “Us” day, every year. Your “Me” day is for you to invest in yourself – go after a life goal, meditate, learn to paint, bake cakes or just have a duvet day watching Netflix!<br><br>Your “Us” day is all about giving back and helping others – volunteer, pick litter at a local park, hang out with the elderly or raise money for a local charity.<br><br>We’re progressive and always open to new initiatives, for example we’ve recently partnered with Fertifa (Leading Fertility and Reproductive Health benefit providers). Because we know the journey to becoming a family isn’t always easy (that includes men too), and we support our people through that journey whether you are new parent, experiencing the menopause, or anything else in between.<br><br>Whatever stage of life you are at, we make sure you have the tools you need to have a healthy work life balance.<br><br><strong>US MARKETING SCIENCES<br><br></strong>The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology.

Our long-established client, based in the heart of the City of London, has created a new Investment Data Analyst position to deliver timely data and reporting to a collaborative and supportive front office team. The Investment Team is at the forefront of the market, dedicated to delivering excellence and sustainability across a wide range of asset classes, from vanilla bonds to hedge funds, private markets to direct property.




In this newly created role, you will establish and develop reporting and analytics for the front office, providing detailed insights into the investment management business. Collaborating with the investment team, including Responsible Investing, you will build an array of reporting and analytics to answer key questions around portfolio management, scheme and fund performance, investment risk, climate, and ESG data for example.




You will lead the migration of analytics data into the cloud, construct data models, and enhance data extractions from providers using APIs and flat files. Proficiency in Excel, including VBA, is essential. While prior experience with Power BI, Charles River, or Barra is not required, a solid understanding of data warehousing and advanced Excel skills are highly desirable.




You will engage with external asset managers to streamline data collection and develop import templates for accurate data integration. As a data steward, you will ensure data accuracy within third-party systems and take ownership of resolving data issues to improve quality. Although this is a newly created role, there is existing reporting that requires rationalisation, and plenty of opportunities to develop more insightful reporting for the front office.




In return, this fast-growing boutique firm offers a small, dynamic environment where the front office and middle office are seamlessly integrated. This provides enormous scope to learn, take on strategic projects, and drive the business forward. You will have the opportunity to assume additional responsibilities and play a key role in shaping the future of the firm. To be considered, candidates must hold an analytical degree and be either an accomplished Investment Data Analyst with around four years of experience or a graduate with at least 12 months of work experience or an internship focused on financial data analysis and reporting.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

A day in the life of a Capital One Data Analyst.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making. As a Data Analyst at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and agony in their financial lives.

Responsibilities:


Writing SQL to clean, transform, investigate data.

Curious: You ask why, you explore, and you’re not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You know SQL and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.
A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database or an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.).
Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in un-mined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.


Basic Qualifications:


Will obtain or have obtained a Bachelor’s degree or higher and graduating in 2024-2025

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Data Analyst Co-op

Our Capital One Data Analysis Team.

Yes, we’re a credit card company. But we’re more than that too. We’re driven by what our customers want, and how to make their lives simpler.

We’re always looking for creative ways to offer digital solutions that make sense for our customers. With your help, we’ll build the next generation of banking in Canada based on customer-focused values, compelling products and great engineering.

Working with us

How do we do things at Capital One Canada? We listen — to our people, and to our customers. We change with the times and have adopted a flexible hybrid model (remote and/or in-office). A flexible hybrid working model is one that creates the opportunity to match the work that we do to the environment that best supports that work. Associates working in the hybrid model are expected to come into the office 3 days a week across Tuesdays and Thursdays, reserving Mondays and Fridays as company-wide virtual days. As was true before the pandemic, expectations of being in the office will be balanced with personal life flexibility. We recognize that everyone has a unique working pattern so we’re open to discussing flexible working arrangements that will best accommodate you.

At Capital One we’re committed to diversity, inclusion and belonging . We strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and inclusive behaviours are embedded in everything we do to positively impact associates. Strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and to help challenge the status quo and create the best outcomes for everyone.

Capital One Canada is an equal opportunity employer committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment. We consider all qualified applicants and will meet the needs of those requiring reasonable accommodations.

A day in the life of a Capital One Data Analyst Co-op.

As a Data Analyst co-op, you will work with cross-functional teams to identify, design and develop tools that address challenges in our business processes. As a creative problem-solver, you will be challenged to consider multiple options and select the optimal solution to meet the needs of your customers. You will own the recommendation and resolution to an existing business problem and will be involved end to end, from problem identification to solution deployment.

Responsibilities:


Build, automate, and maintain critical business reporting using cutting edge tools
Design and develop data solutions that provide seamless execution of business intent
Consult on and influence design of critical business processes and controls
Create, enhance and maintain well managed critical data processes that meet regulatory requirements
Enable delivery of business ideas from concept to implementation
Identify data process improvements and deliver on them
Perform ad hoc analytics on large/diverse datasets


The ideal candidate will be:


Curious: You ask why, you explore, and you're not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You know SQL and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.
A Wrangler: You can quickly learn to programmatically extract data from a database or an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, Quicksight, Tableau, etc.).
Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don't frighten you. You're keen to work with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.


Basic qualifications:


Will obtain or have obtained a Bachelor’s degree or higher between January 2025 and June 2026


Preferred Qualifications :


Pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or another quantitative discipline with a strong programming background
Familiarity with SQL. Python experience would also be an asset
Ability to shape and develop requirements into practical solutions
Ability to clearly explain technical terms to a non-technical audience
Experience in a Unix/Linux environment
Excellent verbal and written communication skills
Previous coop experience

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

A day in the life of a Capital One Data Analyst.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making. As a Data Analyst at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and agony in their financial lives.

Responsibilities:


Writing SQL to clean, transform, investigate data.
Working closely with business partners to harness the power of data in compliance testing.
Designing rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas.
Ensure data and intent integrity by automated data quality verification pipelines.
Supporting and consulting with the business to propagate data management best practices.
Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of digital banking and the financial world of tomorrow.

Curious: You ask why, you explore, and you’re not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You know SQL and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.
A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database or an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.).
Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in un-mined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.

Will obtain or have obtained a Bachelor’s degree or higher and graduating in 2024-2025
