This role is based in Ireland, and you have the option of working remotely from home anywhere in Ireland or on a hybrid basis to our offices in Dublin 2.




ETU helps the world’s leading companies measure and develop skills to drive business performance. Employees apply workplace skills in realistic scenarios while the simulation platform measures their strengths and gaps. Rich data insights inform business decisions and guide skill development at scale.




Our story began on the campus of Trinity College Dublin, where a passionate group of PhD researchers saw the potential of immersive simulation for learners to unlock their true potential, rooted in skill mapping and demonstrating skill adoption through real-life scenarios. Our continued focus on a data-driven methodology has paved the way forward for ETU’s game-changing skill development and verification. With ETU, simulations are co-developed across the full range of critical skills with extensive experience demonstrated in six main categories: leadership, sales and service, diversity, equity and inclusion, onboarding, compliance and risk, and digital transformation. ETU brings a wealth of behavioral science to the creation of these engaging, impactful simulations that can help develop real-world, business-critical skills. 

Part of what makes ETU simulations so effective is that they begin with skill measurement. This is a critical starting point for tracking and personalizing any learning program. Learners can “test out” of material they do not need to review and “test up” to new levels of learning in line with their skill-based strengths and development areas.

ETU helps the world’s leading companies measure and develop skills to drive business performance. Employees apply workplace skills in realistic scenarios while the simulation platform measures their strengths and gaps. Rich data insights inform business decisions and guide skill development at scale.




Our story began on the campus of Trinity College Dublin, where a passionate group of PhD researchers saw the potential of immersive simulation for learners to unlock their true potential, rooted in skill mapping and demonstrating skill adoption through real-life scenarios. Our continued focus on a data-driven methodology has paved the way forward for ETU’s game-changing skill development and verification. With ETU, simulations are co-developed across the full range of critical skills with extensive experience demonstrated in six main categories: leadership, sales and service, diversity, equity and inclusion, onboarding, compliance and risk, and digital transformation. ETU brings a wealth of behavioral science to the creation of these engaging, impactful simulations that can help develop real-world, business-critical skills. 

Part of what makes ETU simulations so effective is that they begin with skill measurement. This is a critical starting point for tracking and personalizing any learning program. Learners can “test out” of material they do not need to review and “test up” to new levels of learning in line with their skill-based strengths and development areas.

Uplight is creating a new category of energy. We make software that manages energy resources in homes and businesses—including things like smart thermostats, electric vehicles, solar panels, storage batteries, heat pumps, and even people’s behavior—to generate, shift, or save energy to balance the grid, making it more efficient and reliable. This creates clean energy capacity that can be used by the power grid instead of burning more fossil fuels. Our solutions accelerate the transition to clean energy and save money for energy customers.

We are looking for a Data Analyst to drive our company forward, and help us lead the clean energy revolution!
