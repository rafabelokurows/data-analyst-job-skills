Collaborate cross departmentally by using data to identify, validate, and uncover drivers of our key performance indicators; implement new metrics to evaluate business performance and/or experiments; build reports and dashboards to monitor and understand them.
Be a voice and advocate to use data to improve the quality of our decision making.


Who You Are


BS or BA degree in computer science, mathematics, statistics, analytics, economics, or equivalent analytical work experience.
At least 2 years of experience in a business environment focused on analysis and reporting, including data visualization tools (Looker, Tableau, PowerBI), influencing business decisions.
Ability to understand and present new data-driven approaches and their relevance to shared business goals.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, using hypothesis-driven analysis to address business questions.
Fluent in SQL and Excel.
Some experience with data modeling and ETL concepts.
Proficient at working with data ambiguity to derive meaningful insights.
