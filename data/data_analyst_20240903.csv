We are looking for a Data Analyst that is passionate about metrics and telling the stories behind the data. We have several roles open across different teams (grocery, loyalty, restaurants). Data Analysts at Deliveroo report into our data science management team.

You will be a professional in insights storytelling, communication and visualisation and know how to create action from metrics.

Work closely with commercial stakeholders to create value and business impact through better data availability, visualisation and analysis
Discover, analyse, and interpret trends or patterns in complex datasets to perform ad-hoc analyses and deliver insights to the executive team and senior management

Identify and specify data needs and quality requirements and work closely with Analytics Engineers to ensure data is available, accurate and corresponds to the business needs
Consolidate and distribute best analytical practices from different teams and countries



Requirements



Experience identifying the root cause of problems, assessing risks/impacts and determining and implementing effective solutions.
A good understanding of querying in SQL and understanding of database structure - you'll be expected to be able to extract the data you need for your analysis.
Compelling story-telling skills, and an eye for powerful visualisations - you'll need to translate your findings for all levels of stakeholder (business and technical)
Good knowledge of Excel/GSheets - depending on the task, there is a good chance that this is where some of your exploratory analysis will take place. Being comfortable with pivot tables and functions will be essential.

Analytics is the compass that guides Sephora on its strategic journey, and we are on the lookout for a Data Analyst who can harness the power of data to propel our business forward. As a Data Analyst, you'll play a critical role in analyzing and interpreting customer data to drive business decisions across our digital platforms. Leveraging your strong experience in BigQuery SQL, you'll craft scripts that seamlessly integrate back-end data with Google Analytics 4 for in-depth customer analysis and segmentation.




Your expertise in data modeling will enable you to map out data structures that support the creation and maintenance of dashboards and reports, tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) related to online engagement, traffic, conversion rates, and marketing effectiveness. In this role, you'll work with data visualization tools like Power BI and Google Data Studio to develop compelling visual reports that convey complex insights in a clear and actionable manner. Additionally, you'll ensure the accuracy and quality of data, while effectively communicating your insights to non-technical stakeholders.







You will also be responsible for:

Writing and optimizing BigQuery SQL scripts for GA4 analysis, integrating back-end data to segment and analyze customer data.
Developing and maintaining dashboards and regular weekly/monthly reports to track KPIs related to performance, online engagement, A/B testing, traffic, conversion rates, marketing attribution, and campaign effectiveness.

Utilizing digital analytics tools like Google Analytics and Quantum Metric to deliver data-driven recommendations.

You will utilize your strong foundation in BigQuery SQL, particularly in GA4 analysis, coupled with hands-on experience in data visualization using tools like Power BI. Your deep understanding of digital analytics, especially within Ecommerce and Retail, will enable you to provide actionable insights that drive business success. Your proficiency in digital analytics tools such as Google Analytics and Quantum Metric will be essential in providing recommendations that optimize performance.







Our ideal candidate will also possess:

Proficiency in Google Analytics, Quantum Metric, or similar digital analytics platforms.
Experience with Google Marketing Platform.
Strong communication skills, both written and verbal, for conveying complex data insights to non-technical stakeholders.
An eye for detail and a commitment to data accuracy and quality.
Familiarity with Google Tag Manager, A/B testing tools, competitor research using market share tools, setting up data feed APIs, and UX platforms would be advantageous.







While at Sephora, You’ll Enjoy...

About The Agency

OmniGov is a specialist division created to handle UK Government media buying, the largest advertiser in the UK, and a top 10 UK agency in its own right, handling over 80 very different government departments. We were originally awarded the four year contract in 2018 and late 2021 we became the first agency ever to retain the business for the next 4 years.

Our ambition is to be the best Government Media Buying service in the world, intelligently using media to deliver public services. In doing so we want to lead the industry in the UK and be one of the best places to work and learn in the media sector. In fact, we have been Campaign’s Agency Team of the Year for the last 3 years.

Our team of c.150 people are passionate about delivering better outcomes for the public sector. Why? This is taxpayers’ money we are dealing with, and the outcomes of these campaigns really do matter. Effectiveness is the driving factor. You will work on campaigns that can represent the most profoundly challenging issues in our society aiming to help, improve or save lives. At other times they simply aim to inform the public. But at all times they matter. To people across the UK and beyond, to us, our families and our own communities.

We are organised across different client hubs themed by government priority nationally, regionally and internationally.

Our core teams and expertise encompass Account Management, Effectiveness & Evaluation, Implementation Planning and Media Activation across all channels.

Working for OmniGOV is different to other jobs in the media agency sector. Working with government can be challenging, dynamic and demands the highest standards, but above all it is important work and rewarding. We believe there is no better place to learn and grow in the industry.

Carwow Group is driven by a passion for getting people into cars. But not just any car, the right car. That's why we are building the go-to destination for car-changing. Designed to reach drivers everywhere with our trail-blazing portfolio of personality rich automotive brands; Carwow, Auto Express, evo, Driving Electric and Car Buyer.

What started as a simple reviews site, is now one of the largest online car-changing destinations in Europe - over 10m customers have used Carwow to help them buy and sell cars since its inception. Last year we grew over 50% with nearly £3bn worth of cars bought on site, while £1.8bn of cars were listed for sale through our Sell My Car service. 

In 2024 we went big and acquired Autovia, doubling our audience overnight. Together we now have one of the biggest YouTube channels in the world with over 1.1 billion annual views, sell 1.2 million print copies of our magazines and have an annual web content reach over 350million.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We’re a company on a mission - We are a unique Canadian Fintech that is the one stop shop for all financial needs of the consumer - Save, Spend, Borrow, Invest, and Protect. Every single team member, from product & engineering to sales & marketing, finance, operations, and everything in between is obsessed with one thing; helping Canadians make better financial choices. And we’re pretty great at it, too. Via our digital application technology and our award-winning in-house brokerages, we help over 2M Canadians per month make a positive impact on their finances. We have many unique businesses - a mortgage brokerage, a life insurance brokerage, a home and auto insurance brokerage, a mortgage originations and servicing business, a Financial Services Marketplace and a content business across Ratehub and MoneySense. 365 days a year we deliver our users the best online mortgage experience, personalized Credit Card and Loans options, and cheaper auto & home insurance policies than they typically get from their existing financial adviser.

Changing how people make financial choices isn’t easy, though. We know that achieving our mission is full of challenges; challenges that can be complex and often unexpected, but that are always interesting, rewarding, and fun to solve as a team. This is where you come in. We are on the hunt for the right kind of people to join us and help lead us forward to continued growth.

We have a newly created Data Team that is capturing data, analyzing it, harvesting it, modeling it to provide meaningful insights to our Members and to our businesses. We’re looking for a top performing Data Analyst to join this team, which will be the backbone of all the businesses (based in downtown Toronto but also open to remote candidates)! Reporting to the Head of Data, the Data Analyst is a critical member of Ratehub’s team who will drive decision making across the company. You will work on high impact projects with business stakeholders and will need to use data to solve long-term and immediate business problems. The role will involve data analysis, modeling and insights development. The ideal candidate has strong communications skills, a passion for data, a background in quantitative analysis and an interest in personal finance. You will get the opportunity to work closely with the other analysts in the team as well as the business stakeholders to learn different parts of the business and provide valuable support with data reporting and analysis across various business units.

Your Responsibilities


Drive business strategy by engaging with key stakeholders to understand the business vision, requirements & priorities and help to translate this into actionable insights
Analyze data to drive meaningful insights on consumer behavior, consumer’s financial needs, attitudes, pricing, revenue management, modeling and AI
Model, build, and maintain scorecards for different parts of the business using our BI tool
Collaborate with the other analysts to support product, marketing, sales and finance teams with ad hoc analysis and reporting
Support in developing and maintaining our data model by understanding key data sources and relationships between them


Your Qualifications


1-2 years’ of relevant work experience at an internet / ecommerce company (including co-ops and internships) required
Post-secondary degree: We value intelligence over relevance, but a Bachelors in Computer Science would be looked upon favorably
High proficiency with SQL for data analysis
Some knowledge of BI & reporting tools e.g. Looker, Tableau, Sisense, QlikView
Knowledge of Python or R is considered an asset
Experience with a web analytics tool to support product and marketing analysis will be an asset
Exposure to cloud infrastructure such as AWS, Azure or GCP is nice to have


BEYOND THE TECHNICAL YOU ARE:


Strong Analytical Skills
Detail oriented: High standard of data quality and integrity
Resourceful: You don’t have all the answers, but you know how to get them
Strong problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities
Adaptable to a fast paced environment and able to pivot quickly to align with changing priorities


CULTURE FIT:


No Ego: No task is too big or small. You are never afraid to ask questions when you are trying to learn and understand things. You have no problem rolling up your sleeves and helping to execute when the team needs help. This humility extends to all aspects of your work and interaction with teammates
Player Coach: You mentor and teach as you execute. You model the behaviour you expect from your team. You don’t just tell others what to do, you know and show how to do it at a high standard
Growth mindset: You have a desire to always continue to grow and learn. This means a willingness to get outside your comfort zone and try new things because you view these as opportunities to gain skills and knowledge
Helping Hand: You always offer to help without having to be asked. You go the extra mile to help out regardless of your team and function
Get S##T Done: Your bias is towards action. This means pitching in and rallying to get things across the finish line. Rather than putting off work ask yourself what you can do today to move the needle on a project or goal
Digs Deep: You aren't afraid to ask questions because you want to understand every issue so that you can properly solve the root cause of the problem instead of just completing the task you are given


JOB PERKS:


Competitive salary: We know life is expensive
Flexible hours: Enjoy a couple more hours of sleep in the morning, if you want
Benefits: Health is wealth! A benefits package with no employee contribution required
Perks: RRSP matching program, individual training allowance, access to financial literacy training and resources
Casual dress code: If it’s good enough for you, it’s good enough for us
Fun team socials


Ratehub welcomes and encourages applications from people with disabilities. Accommodations are available upon request for candidates taking part in all aspects of the selection process.

A day in the life of a Capital One Data Analyst.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making. As a Data Analyst at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and agony in their financial lives.

Responsibilities:


Writing SQL to clean, transform, investigate data.
Working closely with business partners to harness the power of data in compliance testing.
Designing rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas.
Ensure data and intent integrity by automated data quality verification pipelines.
Supporting and consulting with the business to propagate data management best practices.
Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of digital banking and the financial world of tomorrow.
Investigating the use of technology to automate compliance testing.


The ideal candidate will be:


Curious: You ask why, you explore, and you’re not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You know SQL and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.
A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database or an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.).
Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in un-mined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.


Basic Qualifications:


Will obtain or have obtained a Bachelor’s degree or higher and graduating in 2024-2025


Preferred Qualifications :


Pursuing a degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Engineering, or another quantitative discipline
Experience analyzing and manipulating large data sets using tools such as SQL or Python through co-op or school programs

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

          Who we are<br><br><strong>About Stripe<br><br></strong>Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.<br><br><strong>About The Team<br><br></strong>Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.<br><br>What you’ll do<br><br>As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.<br><br><strong>Responsibilities<br><br></strong><ul><li>Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.</li><li>Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.</li><li>Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.</li><li>Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.</li><li>Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.</li><li>Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.<br><br><br></li></ul>Who you are<br><br>We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.<br><br><strong>Minimum Requirements<br><br></strong><ul><li>8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets</li><li>Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field</li><li>Proficiency in SQL and Python</li><li>Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams</li><li>Strong knowledge of statistics</li><li>Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals</li><li>Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail</li><li>Outstanding written and verbal communication skills<br><br><br></li></ul><strong>Preferred Qualifications<br><br></strong><ul><li>Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field</li><li>Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication</li><li>Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight</li><li>Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)<br><br><br></li></ul>Hybrid work at Stripe<br><br>This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).<br><br>Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.<br><br>A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We’re a company on a mission - We are a unique Canadian Fintech that is the one stop shop for all financial needs of the consumer - Save, Spend, Borrow, Invest, and Protect. Every single team member, from product & engineering to sales & marketing, finance, operations, and everything in between is obsessed with one thing; helping Canadians make better financial choices. And we’re pretty great at it, too. Via our digital application technology and our award-winning in-house brokerages, we help over 2M Canadians per month make a positive impact on their finances. We have many unique businesses - a mortgage brokerage, a life insurance brokerage, a home and auto insurance brokerage, a mortgage originations and servicing business, a Financial Services Marketplace and a content business across Ratehub and MoneySense. 365 days a year we deliver our users the best online mortgage experience, personalized Credit Card and Loans options, and cheaper auto & home insurance policies than they typically get from their existing financial adviser.

Changing how people make financial choices isn’t easy, though. We know that achieving our mission is full of challenges; challenges that can be complex and often unexpected, but that are always interesting, rewarding, and fun to solve as a team. This is where you come in. We are on the hunt for the right kind of people to join us and help lead us forward to continued growth.

We have a newly created Data Team that is capturing data, analyzing it, harvesting it, modeling it to provide meaningful insights to our Members and to our businesses. We’re looking for a top performing Data Analyst to join this team, which will be the backbone of all the businesses (based in downtown Toronto but also open to remote candidates)! Reporting to the Head of Data, the Data Analyst is a critical member of Ratehub’s team who will drive decision making across the company. You will work on high impact projects with business stakeholders and will need to use data to solve long-term and immediate business problems. The role will involve data analysis, modeling and insights development. The ideal candidate has strong communications skills, a passion for data, a background in quantitative analysis and an interest in personal finance. You will get the opportunity to work closely with the other analysts in the team as well as the business stakeholders to learn different parts of the business and provide valuable support with data reporting and analysis across various business units.

Your Responsibilities


Drive business strategy by engaging with key stakeholders to understand the business vision, requirements & priorities and help to translate this into actionable insights
Analyze data to drive meaningful insights on consumer behavior, consumer’s financial needs, attitudes, pricing, revenue management, modeling and AI
Model, build, and maintain scorecards for different parts of the business using our BI tool
Collaborate with the other analysts to support product, marketing, sales and finance teams with ad hoc analysis and reporting
Support in developing and maintaining our data model by understanding key data sources and relationships between them


Your Qualifications


1-2 years’ of relevant work experience at an internet / ecommerce company (including co-ops and internships) required
Post-secondary degree: We value intelligence over relevance, but a Bachelors in Computer Science would be looked upon favorably
High proficiency with SQL for data analysis
Some knowledge of BI & reporting tools e.g. Looker, Tableau, Sisense, QlikView
Knowledge of Python or R is considered an asset
Experience with a web analytics tool to support product and marketing analysis will be an asset
Exposure to cloud infrastructure such as AWS, Azure or GCP is nice to have


BEYOND THE TECHNICAL YOU ARE:


Strong Analytical Skills
Detail oriented: High standard of data quality and integrity
Resourceful: You don’t have all the answers, but you know how to get them
Strong problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities
Adaptable to a fast paced environment and able to pivot quickly to align with changing priorities


CULTURE FIT:


No Ego: No task is too big or small. You are never afraid to ask questions when you are trying to learn and understand things. You have no problem rolling up your sleeves and helping to execute when the team needs help. This humility extends to all aspects of your work and interaction with teammates
Player Coach: You mentor and teach as you execute. You model the behaviour you expect from your team. You don’t just tell others what to do, you know and show how to do it at a high standard
Growth mindset: You have a desire to always continue to grow and learn. This means a willingness to get outside your comfort zone and try new things because you view these as opportunities to gain skills and knowledge
Helping Hand: You always offer to help without having to be asked. You go the extra mile to help out regardless of your team and function
Get S##T Done: Your bias is towards action. This means pitching in and rallying to get things across the finish line. Rather than putting off work ask yourself what you can do today to move the needle on a project or goal
Digs Deep: You aren't afraid to ask questions because you want to understand every issue so that you can properly solve the root cause of the problem instead of just completing the task you are given


JOB PERKS:


Competitive salary: We know life is expensive
Flexible hours: Enjoy a couple more hours of sleep in the morning, if you want
Benefits: Health is wealth! A benefits package with no employee contribution required
Perks: RRSP matching program, individual training allowance, access to financial literacy training and resources
Casual dress code: If it’s good enough for you, it’s good enough for us
Fun team socials


Ratehub welcomes and encourages applications from people with disabilities. Accommodations are available upon request for candidates taking part in all aspects of the selection process.

We’re always looking for creative ways to offer digital solutions that make sense for our customers. With your help, we’ll build the next generation of banking in Canada based on customer-focused values, compelling products and great engineering.

Working with us

How do we do things at Capital One Canada? We listen — to our people, and to our customers. We change with the times and have adopted a flexible hybrid model (remote and/or in-office). A flexible hybrid working model is one that creates the opportunity to match the work that we do to the environment that best supports that work. Associates working in the hybrid model are expected to come into the office 3 days a week across Tuesdays and Thursdays, reserving Mondays and Fridays as company-wide virtual days. As was true before the pandemic, expectations of being in the office will be balanced with personal life flexibility. We recognize that everyone has a unique working pattern so we’re open to discussing flexible working arrangements that will best accommodate you.

At Capital One we’re committed to diversity, inclusion and belonging . We strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and inclusive behaviours are embedded in everything we do to positively impact associates. Strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and to help challenge the status quo and create the best outcomes for everyone.

We’re focused on helping associates live well—physically, financially and emotionally. When you join us, we support you and those who are most important to you, offering full coverage for spouses, domestic partners, and dependents. We’ve designed our benefits program to be flexible, comprehensive and consistent across our organization. From health and fitness center discounts, to training and professional development programs—and much more—you’ll discover that Capital One is committed to helping you live your best life.

Capital One Canada is an equal opportunity employer committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment. We consider all qualified applicants and will meet the needs of those requiring reasonable accommodations.

A day in the life of a Capital One Data Analyst.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making. As a Data Analyst at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and agony in their financial lives.

Responsibilities:


Writing SQL to clean, transform, investigate data.
Working closely with business partners to harness the power of data in compliance testing.
Designing rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas.
Ensure data and intent integrity by automated data quality verification pipelines.
Supporting and consulting with the business to propagate data management best practices.
Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of digital banking and the financial world of tomorrow.
Investigating the use of technology to automate compliance testing.


The ideal candidate will be:


Curious: You ask why, you explore, and you’re not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You know SQL and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.
A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database or an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.).
Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in un-mined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.


Basic Qualifications:


Will obtain or have obtained a Bachelor’s degree or higher and graduating in 2024-2025


Preferred Qualifications :


Pursuing a degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Engineering, or another quantitative discipline
Experience analyzing and manipulating large data sets using tools such as SQL or Python through co-op or school programs
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines
Experience in a Linux/Unix environment, with Git, AWS, or APIs through co-op or school programs is considered an asset
Excellent verbal and written communication skills

Human Rights Code.<br><br>One of PHSA’s North Star priorities is to eradicate Indigenous-specific racism, which includes dismantling barriers to health care employment at every level. We welcome Indigenous individuals to apply and/or contact the Sanya'kula Team (Indigenous Recruitment &amp; Employee Experience) for support at indigenous.employment@phsa.ca.<br><br>Indigenous-specific anti-racism initiatives are rooted in addressing the unique forms of discrimination, historical and ongoing injustices, and marginalization faced by Indigenous peoples. These initiatives align with an Indigenous rights-based approach, recognizing the inherent rights and self-determination of Indigenous communities.
