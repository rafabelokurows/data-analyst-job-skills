The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

We are looking for a Data Analyst that is passionate about metrics and telling the stories behind the data. We have several roles open across different teams (grocery, loyalty, restaurants). Data Analysts at Deliveroo report into our data science management team.

You will be a professional in insights storytelling, communication and visualisation and know how to create action from metrics. Crafting effective intelligent benchmarks, understanding performance, caring about data quality, enabling automation and creating phenomenal visualisations and stories are things that drive you.

What you'll be doing



Work closely with commercial stakeholders to create value and business impact through better data availability, visualisation and analysis
Discover, analyse, and interpret trends or patterns in complex datasets to perform ad-hoc analyses and deliver insights to the executive team and senior management
Understand key drivers of the business and provide data driven guidance on key levers
Identify and specify data needs and quality requirements and work closely with Analytics Engineers to ensure data is available, accurate and corresponds to the business needs
Consolidate and distribute best analytical practices from different teams and countries



Requirements



Experience identifying the root cause of problems, assessing risks/impacts and determining and implementing effective solutions.
A good understanding of querying in SQL and understanding of database structure - you'll be expected to be able to extract the data you need for your analysis.
Compelling story-telling skills, and an eye for powerful visualisations - you'll need to translate your findings for all levels of stakeholder (business and technical)
Good knowledge of Excel/GSheets - depending on the task, there is a good chance that this is where some of your exploratory analysis will take place. Being comfortable with pivot tables and functions will be essential.
Developer experience with a data visualisation tool (Looker, Tableau, Periscope)

Analytics is the compass that guides Sephora on its strategic journey, and we are on the lookout for a Data Analyst who can harness the power of data to propel our business forward. As a Data Analyst, you'll play a critical role in analyzing and interpreting customer data to drive business decisions across our digital platforms. Leveraging your strong experience in BigQuery SQL, you'll craft scripts that seamlessly integrate back-end data with Google Analytics 4 for in-depth customer analysis and segmentation.




Your expertise in data modeling will enable you to map out data structures that support the creation and maintenance of dashboards and reports, tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) related to online engagement, traffic, conversion rates, and marketing effectiveness. In this role, you'll work with data visualization tools like Power BI and Google Data Studio to develop compelling visual reports that convey complex insights in a clear and actionable manner. Additionally, you'll ensure the accuracy and quality of data, while effectively communicating your insights to non-technical stakeholders.







You will also be responsible for:

Writing and optimizing BigQuery SQL scripts for GA4 analysis, integrating back-end data to segment and analyze customer data.
Developing and maintaining dashboards and regular weekly/monthly reports to track KPIs related to performance, online engagement, A/B testing, traffic, conversion rates, marketing attribution, and campaign effectiveness.
Using data visualization tools such as Power BI and Google Data Studio to create clear, actionable insights for stakeholders.
Engaging in data modeling to effectively map out data structures that support business goals.
Utilizing digital analytics tools like Google Analytics and Quantum Metric to deliver data-driven recommendations.
Ensuring the accuracy and quality of data while drawing insightful conclusions and making strategic recommendations.

You thrive in an ever-evolving landscape, where driving innovation and continuous improvement is paramount. We are looking for a detail-oriented Data Analyst with strong analytical skills, capable of working both independently and collaboratively within a dynamic team environment.

We value ambition paired with a logical mindset—individuals who are curious, inquisitive, and able to articulate suggestions with precision. You will utilize your strong foundation in BigQuery SQL, particularly in GA4 analysis, coupled with hands-on experience in data visualization using tools like Power BI. Your deep understanding of digital analytics, especially within Ecommerce and Retail, will enable you to provide actionable insights that drive business success. Your proficiency in digital analytics tools such as Google Analytics and Quantum Metric will be essential in providing recommendations that optimize performance.







Our ideal candidate will also possess:

Proficiency in Google Analytics, Quantum Metric, or similar digital analytics platforms.
Experience with Google Marketing Platform.
Strong communication skills, both written and verbal, for conveying complex data insights to non-technical stakeholders.
An eye for detail and a commitment to data accuracy and quality.
Familiarity with Google Tag Manager, A/B testing tools, competitor research using market share tools, setting up data feed APIs, and UX platforms would be advantageous.







While at Sephora, You’ll Enjoy...







The people. You will be surrounded by some of the most talented leaders and teams – people you can be proud to work with.
The learning. We invest in training and developing our teams, and you will continue evolving and building your skills through personalized career plans.

Allica is the UK’s fastest growing company - and the fastest-growing financial technology (fintech) firm ever. Our purpose is to help established SMEs, one of the last major underserved opportunities in fintech. Established SMEs are the backbone of local communities - representing over a third of our economy - yet have been largely neglected both by traditional high street banks and modern fintech providers




Role Description

Data is a key asset to Allica and is deeply embedded in all our teams and products. With data, we assist and work with Finance, Operations, Credit Risk, Product and management. This role will be for the Lending Tribe.




We are looking for ambitious and curious people who can help us understand our data better, contribute to facilitating the discussions between engineering and the data stakeholders and have an impact on the business by telling stories around the insights they generate.




You will be an integral part of the lending data squad, and the initial focus will be scaling up our ability to deliver analytics/insights that shape our understanding of the business and enhancing our foundations for automated reporting




Principal Accountabilities

Understand our products and processes through the data we have or collect
Work with the Lending Tribe and other stakeholders (Ops, risk, etc) to understand their data needs and provide solutions that address the core need (not just the immediate request)
Contribute meaningful insights from our data that proactively drive decisions and new lines of inquiry
Build visualizations and reports that enable the Lending business to service their ongoing data needs and measure KPIs
Develop data knowledge base (definitions, working rhythms etc.) within the team that enables us to become an information hub for the business




Personal Attributes & Experience

Previous experience working as a data analyst (in finance is desirable but not essential)
You like to investigate and challenge narratives using data
The ability to write queries in SQL with logic to combine multiple data sources
You work well with stakeholders across the business.
You communicate effectively and are comfortable with learning how to translate technical detail into business and commercial language.
You have a solid foundation in Python programming OR a strong desire to learn




Don’t tick every box?

Don’t worry if you don’t have all the skills or requirements listed on the job description. If you think you’ll be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you!




Flexible working

We know the ‘9-to-5’ isn’t right for everyone. That’s why Allica Bank is fully committed to flexible and hybrid working. Please let us know what is best for you and, if we can, we will do our best to accommodate.




Diversity

We’re a diverse bunch here at Allica, with all kinds of experiences, backgrounds and lifestyles. Our openness and differences make us stronger, and we want everybody to feel comfortable bringing as much of themselves to work with them as they like.




Additional Information

Working at Allica Bank

At Allica Bank we want to ensure our employees have the right tools and environment in which to succeed in their role and in support of our customers.




Our employees are at the heart of everything we do, so our benefits are designed with you in mind:

Full onboarding support and continued development opportunities
Options for flexible working
Regular social activities
25 days holiday – with the option to Buy/Sell
Pension contributions
Discretionary bonus scheme

At Gaia, we're on a mission to make IVF more accessible for more people. With a better way to pay for treatment, a backup plan if it doesn't work, one-on-one support along the way, and access to a community that just gets it, we're here to offer the IVF experience we wish we'd had. We believe that everyone who wants a family should have the chance to try.

Gaia is a revolutionary way to manage the financial toll and risk associated with fertility treatments. Members begin a new cycle for as little as an upfront protection fee, and only pay for their treatment when they have a child — nothing if they don't. Each plan is personalized and underpinned by a proprietary clinical model predicting treatment outcomes. Launched in 2022 in the UK, Gaia has been recognized in Bloomberg, Wired, and FastCo.

Our Company Values

Because we're building in an extraordinarily complex space, we need to be unapologetically demanding and single-minded in the pursuit of our goals, while going out of our way to support people. Four values drive everything we do at Gaia:

Them, not you: Do right by our members, be kind, and take one for the team.

Drive or get out of the way: Identify problems, take initiative, and step out of your lane.

When in doubt, be brave: It's the only way to bring about change.

Be extraordinary at what you do: Pursue your craft with excellence and seriousness.

The role

As our dedicated data analyst, you will be responsible for the delivery and usage of the data pipeline. You will have ownership around how the data is modelled and how much value it delivers in the company will ultimately depend on you.

You will work closely with engineering and team leads to both excel at data modelling but also provide and support data insights across the company. Your ultimate expertise will help Gaia take better, faster decisions.

What you will own

You will own and work on Gaia's data analytics pipeline:


Working with the engineering and product teams to make sure your data requirements are taken into account before any development work happens
Working with the engineering team to ingest the data and think through how to best model it to a consumable, sensible format and surface it in our BI
Maintaining the data pipeline - with the relevant monitoring in place to ensure it runs smoothly, daily. This includes testing the data and monitoring these tests. You will also work closely with our data engineer to implement new solutions or updates to our current stack.
Work with our data engineer to support specific data flows built around the data warehouse (reverse ETL to our CRM, Ads platforms, ingesting custom data…)


Our stack: dbt + Fivetran + Prefect + Snowflake + Omni

You will also work closely with the rest of the company to:


Ensure the relevant data is shown in the self-serve BI. You will work with different team leaders to deeply understand their areas of focus and ensure the right data is properly modelled & documented so that they can make the most of it to inform their decisions
Ensure teams across Gaia are trained and capable in getting the most out of the BI. This includes developing best practices and tips on how to use Omni, sharing good visualisation techniques, and being a thought-partner on measuring the performance of a product release.


You'll be a great candidate if


You have worked in the past in a similar role within a data team and are fully comfortable around Github and collaborating around dbt. As such you have good experience writing any variant of SQL.
You are comfortable with Python in the context of data modelling.
You've got experience working both with software engineers and business owners ; being able to adapt in how you discuss your work. You understand the trade-offs that engineers might face when architecting the data you consume and you are able to match your needs with their requirements.
You are data-curious: you will help us refine how we model our data to best answer questions and won't hesitate to challenge business decisions with relevant insights.
You know how to balance speed and thoroughness: you like going down data rabbit holes to deeply understand a problem and help answer difficult question, but you are also comfortable with quickly getting to a first answer without iterating too many times.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.




To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.




For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.




A few examples of your responsibilities

Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.




What we look for

Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.




What we offer

Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of €52,246. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.




Commitment & contract

Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time.




Location

Milan (Italy) or fully remote.




Before you apply

          <p>At Bending Spoons, we’re striving to build one of the all-time great companies. A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.</p><p><br></p><p>To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.</p><p><br></p><p>For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A few examples of your responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.</li><li>Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.</li><li>Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.</li><li>Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.</li><li>Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><u>What we look for</u></p><ul><li><strong>Reasoning ability.</strong> Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.</li><li><strong>Drive.</strong> You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.</li><li><strong>Team spirit.</strong> You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.</li><li><strong>Proficiency in English.</strong> You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><u>What we offer</u></p><ul><li><strong>Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams.</strong> You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.</li><li><strong>An exceptional opportunity for growth.</strong> We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.</li><li><strong>Competitive pay and access to equity in the company.</strong> Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of €52,246. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.</li><li><strong>All. These. Benefits.</strong> Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Commitment &amp; contract</strong></p><p>Permanent or fixed-term.

Carwow Group is driven by a passion for getting people into cars. But not just any car, the right car. That's why we are building the go-to destination for car-changing. Designed to reach drivers everywhere with our trail-blazing portfolio of personality rich automotive brands; Carwow, Auto Express, evo, Driving Electric and Car Buyer.

What started as a simple reviews site, is now one of the largest online car-changing destinations in Europe - over 10m customers have used Carwow to help them buy and sell cars since its inception. Last year we grew over 50% with nearly £3bn worth of cars bought on site, while £1.8bn of cars were listed for sale through our Sell My Car service. 

In 2024 we went big and acquired Autovia, doubling our audience overnight. Together we now have one of the biggest YouTube channels in the world with over 1.1 billion annual views, sell 1.2 million print copies of our magazines and have an annual web content reach over 350million.


WHY JOIN US?

We are winners of the prestigious Culture 100 award that recognises the most loved and happiest tech companies to work for! We have just raised $52m in funding led by global venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners (an early backer of LinkedIn and Shopify) to accelerate our growth plans!

As pioneers, we're always driving for new territory and positive change, so our work as a group is never done. Where others see difficulty, it's our responsibility to see possibility - building new experiences, launching new titles and listening to drivers.

Being a part of Carwow Group means championing drivers and the automotive industry, acting as a disrupter and never being afraid to fail (but learning fast when we do!).

WHAT YOU'LL NEED

Please note: We know that no candidate will be the perfect match for all we've listed in this posting, so we'd encourage you to apply if you feel you're close to the brief but not an exact match.

Proactivity and curiosity are vital qualities in our analytics team to enable you to take responsibility for operations for the team.

The ideal candidate will have active SC Clearance or be eligible to undergo SC Clearance.




The Role




Experis Academy are seeking a Data Analyst working for a global organisation on a full-time, initially on a temporary ongoing basis.




People have multiple identities within the data platform. These identities are asserted at various points during the processes and are all associated to an owning person. Applications will then use these identities and the associated biographics as part of their processing.




We experience a 'Merged Identity' issue when the identities for more than one individual are linked together. This then leads to the data from separate individuals displaying under one profile. There are numerous reasons this can arise.




To fix such issues, the current IBM Level 2 team apply a data fix to resolve the underlying issue and split the individuals apart. This is done with direction from which identity belongs to which individual. Identity Operations (IDOps) are currently the client-side team responsible with providing this direction before a final approval is provided by the Common Services Data Platform (CSDP) approval prior to actioning.




Essential skills required




A minimum of 18 months experience in a Data Analyst role.
Excellent problem solving, teamwork skills and collaborative skills.
An eagerness to learn.
Interest in developing and delivering leading edge technologies.
Ability to work in high-pressure scenarios.
Understanding of data tools such as; Postman, graph visualisation software.

Carwow Group is driven by a passion for getting people into cars. But not just any car, the right car. That's why we are building the go-to destination for car-changing. Designed to reach drivers everywhere with our trail-blazing portfolio of personality rich automotive brands; Carwow, Auto Express, evo, Driving Electric and Car Buyer.

What started as a simple reviews site, is now one of the largest online car-changing destinations in Europe - over 10m customers have used Carwow to help them buy and sell cars since its inception. Last year we grew over 50% with nearly £3bn worth of cars bought on site, while £1.8bn of cars were listed for sale through our Sell My Car service. 

In 2024 we went big and acquired Autovia, doubling our audience overnight. Together we now have one of the biggest YouTube channels in the world with over 1.1 billion annual views, sell 1.2 million print copies of our magazines and have an annual web content reach over 350million.

At Gaia, we're on a mission to make IVF more accessible for more people. With a better way to pay for treatment, a backup plan if it doesn't work, one-on-one support along the way, and access to a community that just gets it, we're here to offer the IVF experience we wish we'd had. We believe that everyone who wants a family should have the chance to try.

Gaia is a revolutionary way to manage the financial toll and risk associated with fertility treatments. Members begin a new cycle for as little as an upfront protection fee, and only pay for their treatment when they have a child — nothing if they don't. Each plan is personalized and underpinned by a proprietary clinical model predicting treatment outcomes. Launched in 2022 in the UK, Gaia has been recognized in Bloomberg, Wired, and FastCo.

Our Company Values

Because we're building in an extraordinarily complex space, we need to be unapologetically demanding and single-minded in the pursuit of our goals, while going out of our way to support people. Four values drive everything we do at Gaia:

Them, not you: Do right by our members, be kind, and take one for the team.

Drive or get out of the way: Identify problems, take initiative, and step out of your lane.

When in doubt, be brave: It's the only way to bring about change.

Be extraordinary at what you do: Pursue your craft with excellence and seriousness.

The role

As our dedicated data analyst, you will be responsible for the delivery and usage of the data pipeline. You will have ownership around how the data is modelled and how much value it delivers in the company will ultimately depend on you.

You will work closely with engineering and team leads to both excel at data modelling but also provide and support data insights across the company. Your ultimate expertise will help Gaia take better, faster decisions.

What you will own

You will own and work on Gaia's data analytics pipeline:


Working with the engineering and product teams to make sure your data requirements are taken into account before any development work happens
Working with the engineering team to ingest the data and think through how to best model it to a consumable, sensible format and surface it in our BI
Maintaining the data pipeline - with the relevant monitoring in place to ensure it runs smoothly, daily. This includes testing the data and monitoring these tests. You will also work closely with our data engineer to implement new solutions or updates to our current stack.
Work with our data engineer to support specific data flows built around the data warehouse (reverse ETL to our CRM, Ads platforms, ingesting custom data…)


Our stack: dbt + Fivetran + Prefect + Snowflake + Omni

You will also work closely with the rest of the company to:


Ensure the relevant data is shown in the self-serve BI. You will work with different team leaders to deeply understand their areas of focus and ensure the right data is properly modelled & documented so that they can make the most of it to inform their decisions
Ensure teams across Gaia are trained and capable in getting the most out of the BI. This includes developing best practices and tips on how to use Omni, sharing good visualisation techniques, and being a thought-partner on measuring the performance of a product release.


You'll be a great candidate if


You have worked in the past in a similar role within a data team and are fully comfortable around Github and collaborating around dbt. As such you have good experience writing any variant of SQL.
You are comfortable with Python in the context of data modelling.
You've got experience working both with software engineers and business owners ; being able to adapt in how you discuss your work. You understand the trade-offs that engineers might face when architecting the data you consume and you are able to match your needs with their requirements.
You are data-curious: you will help us refine how we model our data to best answer questions and won't hesitate to challenge business decisions with relevant insights.
You know how to balance speed and thoroughness: you like going down data rabbit holes to deeply understand a problem and help answer difficult question, but you are also comfortable with quickly getting to a first answer without iterating too many times.

Gaia counts 38 employees spanning 10+ different nationalities. Gaia's board of directors is composed of founder Nader AlSalim and 2 women — from Kindred Capital and Leila Zegna from KindredCapital and Terese Hougaard. Women are also well represented at the company's C-suite level (COO, CMO, Chief of Staff) and within Gaia's data and engineering team, a traditionally male dominated field.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We’re a company on a mission - We are a unique Canadian Fintech that is the one stop shop for all financial needs of the consumer - Save, Spend, Borrow, Invest, and Protect. Every single team member, from product & engineering to sales & marketing, finance, operations, and everything in between is obsessed with one thing; helping Canadians make better financial choices. And we’re pretty great at it, too. Via our digital application technology and our award-winning in-house brokerages, we help over 2M Canadians per month make a positive impact on their finances. We have many unique businesses - a mortgage brokerage, a life insurance brokerage, a home and auto insurance brokerage, a mortgage originations and servicing business, a Financial Services Marketplace and a content business across Ratehub and MoneySense. 365 days a year we deliver our users the best online mortgage experience, personalized Credit Card and Loans options, and cheaper auto & home insurance policies than they typically get from their existing financial adviser.

Changing how people make financial choices isn’t easy, though. We know that achieving our mission is full of challenges; challenges that can be complex and often unexpected, but that are always interesting, rewarding, and fun to solve as a team. This is where you come in. We are on the hunt for the right kind of people to join us and help lead us forward to continued growth.

We have a newly created Data Team that is capturing data, analyzing it, harvesting it, modeling it to provide meaningful insights to our Members and to our businesses. We’re looking for a top performing Data Analyst to join this team, which will be the backbone of all the businesses (based in downtown Toronto but also open to remote candidates)! Reporting to the Head of Data, the Data Analyst is a critical member of Ratehub’s team who will drive decision making across the company. You will work on high impact projects with business stakeholders and will need to use data to solve long-term and immediate business problems. The role will involve data analysis, modeling and insights development. The ideal candidate has strong communications skills, a passion for data, a background in quantitative analysis and an interest in personal finance. You will get the opportunity to work closely with the other analysts in the team as well as the business stakeholders to learn different parts of the business and provide valuable support with data reporting and analysis across various business units.

Your Responsibilities


Drive business strategy by engaging with key stakeholders to understand the business vision, requirements & priorities and help to translate this into actionable insights
Analyze data to drive meaningful insights on consumer behavior, consumer’s financial needs, attitudes, pricing, revenue management, modeling and AI
Model, build, and maintain scorecards for different parts of the business using our BI tool
Collaborate with the other analysts to support product, marketing, sales and finance teams with ad hoc analysis and reporting
Support in developing and maintaining our data model by understanding key data sources and relationships between them


Your Qualifications


1-2 years’ of relevant work experience at an internet / ecommerce company (including co-ops and internships) required
Post-secondary degree: We value intelligence over relevance, but a Bachelors in Computer Science would be looked upon favorably
High proficiency with SQL for data analysis
Some knowledge of BI & reporting tools e.g. Looker, Tableau, Sisense, QlikView
Knowledge of Python or R is considered an asset
Experience with a web analytics tool to support product and marketing analysis will be an asset
Exposure to cloud infrastructure such as AWS, Azure or GCP is nice to have


BEYOND THE TECHNICAL YOU ARE:


Strong Analytical Skills
Detail oriented: High standard of data quality and integrity
Resourceful: You don’t have all the answers, but you know how to get them
Strong problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities
Adaptable to a fast paced environment and able to pivot quickly to align with changing priorities


CULTURE FIT:


No Ego: No task is too big or small. You are never afraid to ask questions when you are trying to learn and understand things. You have no problem rolling up your sleeves and helping to execute when the team needs help. This humility extends to all aspects of your work and interaction with teammates
Player Coach: You mentor and teach as you execute. You model the behaviour you expect from your team. You don’t just tell others what to do, you know and show how to do it at a high standard
Growth mindset: You have a desire to always continue to grow and learn. This means a willingness to get outside your comfort zone and try new things because you view these as opportunities to gain skills and knowledge
Helping Hand: You always offer to help without having to be asked. You go the extra mile to help out regardless of your team and function
Get S##T Done: Your bias is towards action. This means pitching in and rallying to get things across the finish line. Rather than putting off work ask yourself what you can do today to move the needle on a project or goal
Digs Deep: You aren't afraid to ask questions because you want to understand every issue so that you can properly solve the root cause of the problem instead of just completing the task you are given


JOB PERKS:


Competitive salary: We know life is expensive
Flexible hours: Enjoy a couple more hours of sleep in the morning, if you want
Benefits: Health is wealth! A benefits package with no employee contribution required
Perks: RRSP matching program, individual training allowance, access to financial literacy training and resources
Casual dress code: If it’s good enough for you, it’s good enough for us
Fun team socials


Ratehub welcomes and encourages applications from people with disabilities. Accommodations are available upon request for candidates taking part in all aspects of the selection process.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We’re a company on a mission - We are a unique Canadian Fintech that is the one stop shop for all financial needs of the consumer - Save, Spend, Borrow, Invest, and Protect. Every single team member, from product & engineering to sales & marketing, finance, operations, and everything in between is obsessed with one thing; helping Canadians make better financial choices. And we’re pretty great at it, too. Via our digital application technology and our award-winning in-house brokerages, we help over 2M Canadians per month make a positive impact on their finances. We have many unique businesses - a mortgage brokerage, a life insurance brokerage, a home and auto insurance brokerage, a mortgage originations and servicing business, a Financial Services Marketplace and a content business across Ratehub and MoneySense. 365 days a year we deliver our users the best online mortgage experience, personalized Credit Card and Loans options, and cheaper auto & home insurance policies than they typically get from their existing financial adviser.

Changing how people make financial choices isn’t easy, though. We know that achieving our mission is full of challenges; challenges that can be complex and often unexpected, but that are always interesting, rewarding, and fun to solve as a team. This is where you come in. We are on the hunt for the right kind of people to join us and help lead us forward to continued growth.

We have a newly created Data Team that is capturing data, analyzing it, harvesting it, modeling it to provide meaningful insights to our Members and to our businesses. We’re looking for a top performing Data Analyst to join this team, which will be the backbone of all the businesses (based in downtown Toronto but also open to remote candidates)! Reporting to the Head of Data, the Data Analyst is a critical member of Ratehub’s team who will drive decision making across the company. You will work on high impact projects with business stakeholders and will need to use data to solve long-term and immediate business problems. The role will involve data analysis, modeling and insights development. The ideal candidate has strong communications skills, a passion for data, a background in quantitative analysis and an interest in personal finance. You will get the opportunity to work closely with the other analysts in the team as well as the business stakeholders to learn different parts of the business and provide valuable support with data reporting and analysis across various business units.

Your Responsibilities


Drive business strategy by engaging with key stakeholders to understand the business vision, requirements & priorities and help to translate this into actionable insights
Analyze data to drive meaningful insights on consumer behavior, consumer’s financial needs, attitudes, pricing, revenue management, modeling and AI
Model, build, and maintain scorecards for different parts of the business using our BI tool
Collaborate with the other analysts to support product, marketing, sales and finance teams with ad hoc analysis and reporting
Support in developing and maintaining our data model by understanding key data sources and relationships between them


Your Qualifications


1-2 years’ of relevant work experience at an internet / ecommerce company (including co-ops and internships) required
Post-secondary degree: We value intelligence over relevance, but a Bachelors in Computer Science would be looked upon favorably
High proficiency with SQL for data analysis
Some knowledge of BI & reporting tools e.g. Looker, Tableau, Sisense, QlikView
Knowledge of Python or R is considered an asset
Experience with a web analytics tool to support product and marketing analysis will be an asset
Exposure to cloud infrastructure such as AWS, Azure or GCP is nice to have


BEYOND THE TECHNICAL YOU ARE:


Strong Analytical Skills
Detail oriented: High standard of data quality and integrity
Resourceful: You don’t have all the answers, but you know how to get them
Strong problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities
Adaptable to a fast paced environment and able to pivot quickly to align with changing priorities


CULTURE FIT:


No Ego: No task is too big or small. You are never afraid to ask questions when you are trying to learn and understand things. You have no problem rolling up your sleeves and helping to execute when the team needs help. This humility extends to all aspects of your work and interaction with teammates
Player Coach: You mentor and teach as you execute. You model the behaviour you expect from your team. You don’t just tell others what to do, you know and show how to do it at a high standard
Growth mindset: You have a desire to always continue to grow and learn. This means a willingness to get outside your comfort zone and try new things because you view these as opportunities to gain skills and knowledge
Helping Hand: You always offer to help without having to be asked. You go the extra mile to help out regardless of your team and function
Get S##T Done: Your bias is towards action. This means pitching in and rallying to get things across the finish line. Rather than putting off work ask yourself what you can do today to move the needle on a project or goal
Digs Deep: You aren't afraid to ask questions because you want to understand every issue so that you can properly solve the root cause of the problem instead of just completing the task you are given


JOB PERKS:


Competitive salary: We know life is expensive
Flexible hours: Enjoy a couple more hours of sleep in the morning, if you want
Benefits: Health is wealth! A benefits package with no employee contribution required
Perks: RRSP matching program, individual training allowance, access to financial literacy training and resources
Casual dress code: If it’s good enough for you, it’s good enough for us
Fun team socials


Ratehub welcomes and encourages applications from people with disabilities. Accommodations are available upon request for candidates taking part in all aspects of the selection process.

A day in the life of a Capital One Data Analyst.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making. As a Data Analyst at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and agony in their financial lives.

Responsibilities:


Writing SQL to clean, transform, investigate data.

Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.

PHSA is committed to equity in our hiring and employment practices. With learning and compassion, we are addressing existing inequities and barriers throughout our systems. PHSA is seeking to create a diverse workforce and to establish an inclusive and culturally safe environment. We invite applications and enquiries from all people, particularly those belonging to the historically, systemically, and/or persistently marginalized groups identified under the B.C. Human Rights Code.

One of PHSA’s North Star priorities is to eradicate Indigenous-specific racism, which includes dismantling barriers to health care employment at every level. We welcome Indigenous individuals to apply and/or contact the Sanya'kula Team (Indigenous Recruitment & Employee Experience) for support at indigenous.employment@phsa.ca.

Indigenous-specific anti-racism initiatives are rooted in addressing the unique forms of discrimination, historical and ongoing injustices, and marginalization faced by Indigenous peoples. These initiatives align with an Indigenous rights-based approach, recognizing the inherent rights and self-determination of Indigenous communities. PHSA must uphold legislative obligations and provincial commitments found in the foundational documents such as including Truth & Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action (2015), In Plain Sight (2020), BC's Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (2019), United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), Reclaiming Power and Place Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women & Girls Calls for Justice (2019), the Declaration Act Action Plan and Remembering Keegan: A First Nations Case Study.
