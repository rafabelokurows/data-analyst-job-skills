Analytics is the compass that guides Sephora on its strategic journey, and we are on the lookout for a Data Analyst who can harness the power of data to propel our business forward.

At Gaia, we're on a mission to make IVF more accessible for more people. With a better way to pay for treatment, a backup plan if it doesn't work, one-on-one support along the way, and access to a community that just gets it, we're here to offer the IVF experience we wish we'd had. We believe that everyone who wants a family should have the chance to try.

Gaia is a revolutionary way to manage the financial toll and risk associated with fertility treatments. Members begin a new cycle for as little as an upfront protection fee, and only pay for their treatment when they have a child — nothing if they don't. Each plan is personalized and underpinned by a proprietary clinical model predicting treatment outcomes. Launched in 2022 in the UK, Gaia has been recognized in Bloomberg, Wired, and FastCo.

Our Company Values

Because we're building in an extraordinarily complex space, we need to be unapologetically demanding and single-minded in the pursuit of our goals, while going out of our way to support people. Four values drive everything we do at Gaia:

Them, not you: Do right by our members, be kind, and take one for the team.

Drive or get out of the way: Identify problems, take initiative, and step out of your lane.

When in doubt, be brave: It's the only way to bring about change.

Be extraordinary at what you do: Pursue your craft with excellence and seriousness.

The role

As our dedicated data analyst, you will be responsible for the delivery and usage of the data pipeline. You will have ownership around how the data is modelled and how much value it delivers in the company will ultimately depend on you.

You will work closely with engineering and team leads to both excel at data modelling but also provide and support data insights across the company. Your ultimate expertise will help Gaia take better, faster decisions.

What you will own

You will own and work on Gaia's data analytics pipeline:


Working with the engineering and product teams to make sure your data requirements are taken into account before any development work happens
Working with the engineering team to ingest the data and think through how to best model it to a consumable, sensible format and surface it in our BI
Maintaining the data pipeline - with the relevant monitoring in place to ensure it runs smoothly, daily. This includes testing the data and monitoring these tests. You will also work closely with our data engineer to implement new solutions or updates to our current stack.
Work with our data engineer to support specific data flows built around the data warehouse (reverse ETL to our CRM, Ads platforms, ingesting custom data…)


Our stack: dbt + Fivetran + Prefect + Snowflake + Omni

You will also work closely with the rest of the company to:


Ensure the relevant data is shown in the self-serve BI. You will work with different team leaders to deeply understand their areas of focus and ensure the right data is properly modelled & documented so that they can make the most of it to inform their decisions
Ensure teams across Gaia are trained and capable in getting the most out of the BI. This includes developing best practices and tips on how to use Omni, sharing good visualisation techniques, and being a thought-partner on measuring the performance of a product release.


You'll be a great candidate if


You have worked in the past in a similar role within a data team and are fully comfortable around Github and collaborating around dbt. As such you have good experience writing any variant of SQL.
You are comfortable with Python in the context of data modelling.
You've got experience working both with software engineers and business owners ; being able to adapt in how you discuss your work. You understand the trade-offs that engineers might face when architecting the data you consume and you are able to match your needs with their requirements.
You are data-curious: you will help us refine how we model our data to best answer questions and won't hesitate to challenge business decisions with relevant insights.
You know how to balance speed and thoroughness: you like going down data rabbit holes to deeply understand a problem and help answer difficult question, but you are also comfortable with quickly getting to a first answer without iterating too many times.

Carwow Group is driven by a passion for getting people into cars. But not just any car, the right car. That's why we are building the go-to destination for car-changing. Designed to reach drivers everywhere with our trail-blazing portfolio of personality rich automotive brands; Carwow, Auto Express, evo, Driving Electric and Car Buyer.

What started as a simple reviews site, is now one of the largest online car-changing destinations in Europe - over 10m customers have used Carwow to help them buy and sell cars since its inception. Last year we grew over 50% with nearly £3bn worth of cars bought on site, while £1.8bn of cars were listed for sale through our Sell My Car service. 

In 2024 we went big and acquired Autovia, doubling our audience overnight. Together we now have one of the biggest YouTube channels in the world with over 1.1 billion annual views, sell 1.2 million print copies of our magazines and have an annual web content reach over 350million.


WHY JOIN US?

We are winners of the prestigious Culture 100 award that recognises the most loved and happiest tech companies to work for! We have just raised $52m in funding led by global venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners (an early backer of LinkedIn and Shopify) to accelerate our growth plans!

As pioneers, we're always driving for new territory and positive change, so our work as a group is never done. Where others see difficulty, it's our responsibility to see possibility - building new experiences, launching new titles and listening to drivers.

Being a part of Carwow Group means championing drivers and the automotive industry, acting as a disrupter and never being afraid to fail (but learning fast when we do!).

Our team of 500 employees across the UK, Germany, Spain and Portugal are revolutionising car-changing and we are fast expanding our mission across every single brand and country we operate in, so jump in!

The role sits within the Analytics & Data Science team to benefit from the wider expertise but is closely aligned with Commercial stakeholders to enable us to deliver the most impactful analysis by fully understanding business questions and problems that we need to solve.

WHAT YOU'LL DO

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.
