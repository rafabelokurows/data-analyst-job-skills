We created the first end-to-end TransitTech solution for cities and transit agencies, offering world-class software, service design, and operational expertise to fundamentally improve the way the world moves.

Via was founded with the guiding principle that we go further when we go together. We are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace.

Wat ga je doen

Wij zijn Forfacts, een sterk groeiende consultancy startup. Wij geloven in een eenvoudige wereld, eentje zonder bureaucratie en omslachtigheid. Een wereld waarin mensen houden van eerlijke discussies en zeggen wat ze denken. Wij helpen organisaties met verandermanagement, procesoptimalisatie, procesautomatisering, datagedreven werken, dataontsluiting, dashboarddesign, en nog veel meer. Ons uiteindelijke doel? Eenvoud. Hoe doen we dat? We creëren inzicht, vanuit vrijheid en met realisme.




De rol

Als BI/data consultant help jij onze opdrachtgevers te vereenvoudigen. Afhankelijk van de opdracht bevindt je je korter of voor langere termijn binnen de organisatie van de opdrachtgever. Dit doen wij door écht inzicht te geven: op basis van feiten en data, en niet op onderbuikgevoel.

Wij geloven in een integrale aanpak van mens, proces, systeem en informatie: de mens werkt in een proces, het proces wordt geborgd in een systeem, uit dit systeem ontsluiten we data, waar we vervolgens informatie voor de mens van maken. Met het inzicht uit deze informatie, stuurt de mens het proces aan. In deze functie ligt de focus ligt op het ontsluiten van data en het vertalen van deze data naar inzichten. Zo help jij bijvoorbeeld met het inventariseren van de benodigde stuurinformatie en gebruikersbehoeften, het verzamelen en opschonen van de onderliggende data, en het ontwikkelen van een dashboard met relevante sturingsinformatie.




Dit ben jij

Onze factbuilders zijn mensen die met verwondering naar de wereld kijken. Af en toe een tikkeltje rebels, maar bovenal creatief van geest in het bedenken van oplossingen. Daarnaast zoeken wij voor deze rol:

Je hebt een afgeronde studie in de richting van (technische) Bedrijfskunde, Accountancy, Finance, Data Science, Operations Management of vergelijkbaar.
Je hebt een positieve en proactieve instelling in combinatie met een groot relativeringsvermogen. Het is uiteindelijk maar werk ;).
Je brengt passie, plezier en af en toe wat gekkigheid. Je krijgt het immers ook terug.
Je kan goed zelfstandig werken, maar weet ook intern om hulp te vragen waar nodig.
Jij kan ook goed samenwerken en communiceren, zodat jij bij opdrachtgevers de juiste mensen weet te vinden.
Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal goed, het draait niet alleen maar om eentjes en nulletjes.
Je hebt affiniteit met data en processen, of de wens je te verdiepen in de mogelijkheden hiervan. Wij leren je graag de ins en outs!
Kennis van data analyse, Business Intelligence, Data Science en/of Lean SixSigma is een pré.




Dit krijg jij ervoor terug

Met een bachelor op zak, ontvang je een minimaal startsalaris van €2.900,- op basis van 40 uren per week (of meer, afhankelijk van kennis en/of werkervaring). Aanstelling voor 32 uur ook mogelijk.
Ruime mobiliteitsregeling: mogelijkheden voor een leaseauto, NS Business Card of ruime reiskostenvergoeding voor eigen vervoer.
Hybride werken.
Onbeperkt verlof.
Een sportieve omgeving. Wil jij een marathon lopen of een toernooi voor het hele team organiseren? Leuk, wij vergoeden het voor je!
Ruimte om je zowel persoonlijk als inhoudelijk verder te ontwikkelingen met diverse trainingen (denk aan datagedreven werken, verandermanagement en procesoptimalisatie). Allemaal in lijn met jouw eigen ambities.
Passie en plezier. Naast hard werken vieren wij succes met borrels, uitjes en sportiviteit, zoals ons jaarlijkse skiweekend in Oostenrijk :).
We zijn een volwassen start-up: je staat met ons aan de basis van de ontwikkeling van de organisatie. Jouw ideeën doen ertoe.

Wij zijn Forfacts, een sterk groeiende consultancy startup. Wij geloven in een eenvoudige wereld, eentje zonder bureaucratie en omslachtigheid. Een wereld waarin mensen houden van eerlijke discussies en zeggen wat ze denken. Wij helpen organisaties met verandermanagement, procesoptimalisatie, procesautomatisering, datagedreven werken, dataontsluiting, dashboarddesign, en nog veel meer. Ons uiteindelijke doel? Eenvoud. Hoe doen we dat? We creëren inzicht, vanuit vrijheid en met realisme.




De rol

Als BI/data consultant help jij onze opdrachtgevers te vereenvoudigen. Afhankelijk van de opdracht bevindt je je korter of voor langere termijn binnen de organisatie van de opdrachtgever. Dit doen wij door écht inzicht te geven: op basis van feiten en data, en niet op onderbuikgevoel.

Wij geloven in een integrale aanpak van mens, proces, systeem en informatie: de mens werkt in een proces, het proces wordt geborgd in een systeem, uit dit systeem ontsluiten we data, waar we vervolgens informatie voor de mens van maken. Met het inzicht uit deze informatie, stuurt de mens het proces aan. In deze functie ligt de focus ligt op het ontsluiten van data en het vertalen van deze data naar inzichten. Zo help jij bijvoorbeeld met het inventariseren van de benodigde stuurinformatie en gebruikersbehoeften, het verzamelen en opschonen van de onderliggende data, en het ontwikkelen van een dashboard met relevante sturingsinformatie.




Dit ben jij

Onze factbuilders zijn mensen die met verwondering naar de wereld kijken. Af en toe een tikkeltje rebels, maar bovenal creatief van geest in het bedenken van oplossingen. Daarnaast zoeken wij voor deze rol:

Je hebt een afgeronde studie in de richting van (technische) Bedrijfskunde, Accountancy, Finance, Data Science, Operations Management of vergelijkbaar.
Je hebt een positieve en proactieve instelling in combinatie met een groot relativeringsvermogen. Het is uiteindelijk maar werk ;).
Je brengt passie, plezier en af en toe wat gekkigheid. Je krijgt het immers ook terug.
Je kan goed zelfstandig werken, maar weet ook intern om hulp te vragen waar nodig.
Jij kan ook goed samenwerken en communiceren, zodat jij bij opdrachtgevers de juiste mensen weet te vinden.
Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal goed, het draait niet alleen maar om eentjes en nulletjes.
Je hebt affiniteit met data en processen, of de wens je te verdiepen in de mogelijkheden hiervan. Wij leren je graag de ins en outs!
Kennis van data analyse, Business Intelligence, Data Science en/of Lean SixSigma is een pré.




Dit krijg jij ervoor terug

Met een bachelor op zak, ontvang je een minimaal startsalaris van €2.900,- op basis van 40 uren per week (of meer, afhankelijk van kennis en/of werkervaring). Aanstelling voor 32 uur ook mogelijk.
Ruime mobiliteitsregeling: mogelijkheden voor een leaseauto, NS Business Card of ruime reiskostenvergoeding voor eigen vervoer.
Hybride werken.
Onbeperkt verlof.
Een sportieve omgeving. Wil jij een marathon lopen of een toernooi voor het hele team organiseren? Leuk, wij vergoeden het voor je!
Ruimte om je zowel persoonlijk als inhoudelijk verder te ontwikkelingen met diverse trainingen (denk aan datagedreven werken, verandermanagement en procesoptimalisatie). Allemaal in lijn met jouw eigen ambities.
Passie en plezier. Naast hard werken vieren wij succes met borrels, uitjes en sportiviteit, zoals ons jaarlijkse skiweekend in Oostenrijk :).
We zijn een volwassen start-up: je staat met ons aan de basis van de ontwikkeling van de organisatie. Jouw ideeën doen ertoe.

Du liebst Daten und hast erkannt, dass sie das Gold der Zukunft sind? Du möchtest lernen, Zusammenhänge und Muster darin zu erkennen? Sehr gut, dann suchen wir Dich ab Oktober 2024 am Standort Stuttgart für unser berufsbegleitendes Masterprogramm!

Das Masterstudium zeichnet sich durch eine hohe Anwendungsorientierung aus und ermöglicht ein gewinnbringendes Studieren in Verbindung mit dem Beruf. Dabei wird dir im theoretischen Teil des Studiums modernes Wissen, Vorgehensweisen und Tools in den Bereichen Datenanalyse, maschinelles Lernen, künstliche Intelligenz und Big Data vermittelt. Du lernst, wie Du Daten effektiv erfasst, verarbeitest, analysierst und modellierst, um große Datenmengen gewinnbringend zu nutzen, komplexe Probleme zu lösen und eine datenbasierte Entscheidungsfindung zu unterstützen.

Studiendauer: voraussichtlich 5 Semester

Deine Aufgaben

Das Masterstudium Data Science & Business Analytics bei DYMATRIX beinhaltet 3 Schwerpunkte: Data Management, Marketing Automation & Costumer Analytics/ Data Science. Nach dem Studium bist Du also in der Lage, die Kundenansprache von Unternehmen in Form von Marketingkampagnen mit Hilfe von Daten zu optimieren.

Data Management

Du wirst bei uns im Bereich Solutions & Consulting eingesetzt – und lernst so die technische und fachliche Grundlage für unser Business kennen:


Du erlebst, wie theoretische Vorlesungsinhalte zu „Business Intelligence“ und „Data Warehousing“ in der Praxis angewendet werden und arbeitest Dich mit unserer Unterstützung in die Themen ein. So bleiben ETL-Prozesse, OLAP-Cubes und Reportings für Dich nicht nur graue Theorie, sondern werden Bestandteil spannender Projektarbeit.
Du hebst das Datengold, indem Du lernst, komplexe Datenarchitekturen zur Massendaten- (BIG DATA) oder Echtzeitdatenverarbeitung zu konzipieren und zu realisieren.
Du sorgst für die Umsetzung auf Basis neuester Technologien unserer führenden Technikpartner, lässt das Gold in Social-Media-Plattformen fließen und optimierst den Fluss durch z.B. InMemory-Datenbanken.
… und dabei bleibst Du nicht stehen, sondern erschließt neue Goldminen und arbeitest Dich mit unserer Unterstützung in neue Technologien ein.


Marketing Automation:


Du erhältst Einblick in herausfordernde Prozesse im Bereich Marketing Automation und Customer Monitoring und unterstützt uns bei der Umsetzung.
Du sorgst für die Umsetzung Deines erworbenen Wissens rund um Data Management/ Business Analytics und Data Science, um die Marketingkampagnen unserer Kundenunternehmen zu automatisieren und zu optimieren.


Im letzten Semester arbeitest Du in Analytics-Projekten mit und hilfst gemeinsam mit uns dabei, das Datengold unserer Kunden weiter zu veredeln.

Customer Analytics/ Data Science


Anhand von Algorithmen und Modellen sagst Du vorher, was ein Kunde / eine Kundin wollen wird – vielleicht ohne, dass er / sie es selbst schon weiß!
Du optimierst den Gutscheinversand, prognostizierst Kündigungswahrscheinlichkeiten oder hilfst, die Zweitkaufrate zu steigern.
Dazu arbeitest du mit Daten in verschiedenen Speichersystemen (z.B. Hadoop, relationale Datenbanken, NoSQL) und bereitest die Inhalte für die konkrete Analysefragestellung auf.
Außerdem nutzt du statistische Software (KNIME, Apache Spark, R, Python …) um Analysen durchzuführen und verschiedene Data Mining-Modelle zu entwickeln.


Die dazugehörigen Vorlesungen und theoretischen Lehrinhalte werden Dir an einer unserer Kooperationshochschulen (z.B. HdM), ggf. in Form eines mehrstufigen Kontaktstudiums vermittelt.

Das Bringst Du Idealerweise Mit


abgeschlossenes Bachelor- oder Diplomstudium (mindestens 210 ECTS) in Wirtschaftsinformatik, -mathematik, -wissenschaften, Ökonometrie, Statistik, Psychologie, Physik, Informatik oder vergleichbare Studiengänge
mindestens eine einjährige einschlägige Berufserfahrung nach dem ersten Hochschulstudium
ausgeprägte analytische und konzeptionelle Denkweise
Programmieraffinität
Interesse an CRM/Marketing
sehr gute Präsentations- und Kommunikationsfähigkeiten

Kooperation: Du arbeitest in interdisziplinären Teams, um datengetriebene Projekte erfolgreich umzusetzen und gemeinsam die Zukunft unserer Datenplattform zu gestalten und weiterzuentwickeln.

Das erwartet dich

Projektarbeit – Gemeinsam mit unserem Team unterstützt du unsere nationalen und internationalen Kunden bei Benchmarking und Data Analytics Projekten.

Vielfältige Themen – Du bietest unseren Kunden Benchmarking-Lösungen zur Markt- und Preisübersicht oder zur Beurteilung behördlicher Vorgaben in regulierten Bereichen der Energiebranche. Daneben unterstützt du große Industriekunden bei der Ermittlung ihrer Emissionen mit Hilfe von globalen Input-Output Modellen. Hierbei spielen Data Science, Machine Learning und die Entwicklung von Business-Intelligence-Anwendungen eine zentrale Rolle. Daneben implementierst du Lösungen zur Digitalisierung von Beratungsleistungen.

Verantwortung – Du übernimmst entsprechend deiner Erfahrung und Qualifikation Verantwortung für Teilprojekte oder auch die Gesamtprojektleitung.

Das bringst du mit


Dein Studium der (Wirtschafts-)Informatik, Statistik, Wirtschaftswissenschaft, Energiewirtschaft oder einer vergleichbaren Disziplin hast du erfolgreich abgeschlossen.
Idealerweise bringst du erste praktische Erfahrung in den Bereichen Statistik, Data Analytics, Programmierung, Datenbankmanagement, Softwarearchitektur oder Nachhaltigkeitsmanagement mit.
Du hast bereits Erfahrung mit R sowie idealerweise auch Power BI, Shiny oder Python, sowie eine hohe Lernbereitschaft für neue Tools.
Du verfügst über sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse in Wort und Schrift.


Deine Benefits

Flexibilität – Deine Arbeitszeit und deinen Arbeitsort kannst du bei uns - in Abstimmung mit den betrieblichen Anforderungen und arbeitsrechtlichen Bestimmungen - selber bestimmen.

Masterförderung – Durch unsere interne Academy, internationale Erfahrungen durch Secondments und kontinuierliches Mentoring entwickelst du dich stetig weiter. Darüber hinaus bieten wir die Möglichkeit einer Masterförderung für Examensmaster und Spezialisierungsmaster an.

Freizeit – Dank eines Teilzeit-Blockmodells kannst du auch mehrmonatige Auszeiten in Form eines Sabbaticals nehmen. Zusätzlich kannst du bei PwC Deutschland Überstunden auf einem persönlichen Jahresarbeitszeitkonto sammeln. Dabei bleibt es dir überlassen, ob du dir deine Überstunden auszahlen lässt oder flexibel in mehr Freizeit umwandelst.

Gesundheit – Deine Gesundheit liegt uns am Herzen: Neben einer eigenen betrieblichen Krankenkasse bieten wir auch Vorsorgeuntersuchungen sowie Sportangebote an. Nimm an unserem kostenlosen Betriebssportprogramm teil oder profitiere von vergünstigten Beiträgen in diversen Fitnessstudios oder einer Urban Sports Club-Mitgliedschaft.

Das ist noch nicht alles – Wir möchten ein positives Arbeitsumfeld schaffen: Ein Umfeld, in dem flexibles und kreatives Arbeiten möglich ist, in dem Arbeit anerkannt und Leistung honoriert wird und auf das wir stolz sind. Alle Benefits findest du auf unserer Karriereseite.

Bei PwC Deutschland arbeiten wir daran, entscheidende Herausforderungen zu lösen, nachhaltige Ergebnisse zu schaffen und das Vertrauen in die Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft auszubauen.

Ein Traditionsunternehmen, das internationale Wege geht, seine Ziele klar definiert und innovative Möglichkeiten schafft.

Deine Aufgaben

Als Business Intelligence Developer (m/w/d) bei Breuninger spielst Du eine zentrale Rolle in der Weiterentwicklung unserer Datenplattform. Du verantwortest die End-to-End-Entwicklung wiederverwendbarer Datenprodukte in einem modernen Data Stack und arbeitest eng mit verschiedenen Fachbereichen zusammen, um aus Daten aussagekräftige Insights zu generieren und datengetriebene Entscheidungen zu unterstützen. Dabei bist Du auch im ständigen Austausch mit anderen Datenteams wie Data Engineering und Data Science. Du hast keine Angst vor großen Datenmengen.


Plattform weiterentwickeln: Du bist maßgeblich an der Gestaltung und kontinuierlichen Weiterentwicklung unserer Datenplattform beteiligt. Dabei übernimmst Du die End-to-End-Entwicklung von der Anforderungsdefinition über die Datenmodellierung bis hin zur Implementierung und Überwachung. Aus Rohdaten entwickelst Du wiederverwendbare Datenprodukte.
Insights generieren: Du unterstützt verschiedene Unternehmensbereiche dabei, aus komplexen Daten wertvolle Erkenntnisse zu generieren und legst dabei besonderen Wert auf einen effizienten Time-to-Insight. Durch die Analyse von Anforderungen und die Erstellung klar verständlicher Dashboards ermöglichst Du den Fachbereichen eine verbesserte Steuerung und förderst datenbasierte Entscheidungen.
Datengetriebenes Arbeiten unterstützen: Du befähigst andere Teams, eigenständig und effizient mit Daten im Self-Service (bspw. Power BI und Looker Studio) zu arbeiten. Dafür führst Du nicht nur maßgeschneiderte Trainings durch, sondern vermittelst auch bewährte Best Practices im Umgang mit Daten.
Innovation vorantreiben: Du nutzt Deine Erfahrung und Expertise, um neue datengetriebene Lösungen zu entwickeln und bestehende Prozesse zu verbessern. Genau wie unsere Systeme stehst Du nicht still und interessierst Dich für neue Technologien und Software insbesondere in den Bereichen Data Management, Data Warehousing und Big Data.
Qualität sichern: Du implementierst Best Practices für Datenqualität, Überwachung und Sicherheit, um eine zuverlässige Dateninfrastruktur sicherzustellen. Du treibst Data Governance-Themen voran und trägst du dazu bei, Regeln, Standards und Prozesse zu definieren.
Kooperation: Du arbeitest in interdisziplinären Teams, um datengetriebene Projekte erfolgreich umzusetzen und gemeinsam die Zukunft unserer Datenplattform zu gestalten und weiterzuentwickeln.

Deine Aufgaben

Als Analytical Engineer (m/w/d) bei Breuninger spielst Du eine zentrale Rolle in der Weiterentwicklung unserer Datenplattform. Du verantwortest die End-to-End-Entwicklung wiederverwendbarer Datenprodukte in einem modernen Data Stack und arbeitest eng mit verschiedenen Fachbereichen zusammen, um aus Daten aussagekräftige Insights zu generieren und datengetriebene Entscheidungen zu unterstützen. Dabei bist Du auch im ständigen Austausch mit anderen Datenteams wie Data Engineering und Data Science. Du hast keine Angst vor großen Datenmengen.


Plattform weiterentwickeln: Du bist maßgeblich an der Gestaltung und kontinuierlichen Weiterentwicklung unserer Datenplattform beteiligt. Dabei übernimmst Du die End-to-End-Entwicklung von der Anforderungsdefinition über die Datenmodellierung bis hin zur Implementierung und Überwachung. Aus Rohdaten entwickelst Du wiederverwendbare Datenprodukte.
Insights generieren: Du unterstützt verschiedene Unternehmensbereiche dabei, aus komplexen Daten wertvolle Erkenntnisse zu generieren und legst dabei besonderen Wert auf einen effizienten Time-to-Insight. Durch die Analyse von Anforderungen und die Erstellung klar verständlicher Dashboards ermöglichst Du den Fachbereichen eine verbesserte Steuerung und förderst datenbasierte Entscheidungen.
Datengetriebenes Arbeiten unterstützen: Du befähigst andere Teams, eigenständig und effizient mit Daten im Self-Service (bspw. Power BI und Looker Studio) zu arbeiten. Dafür führst Du nicht nur maßgeschneiderte Trainings durch, sondern vermittelst auch bewährte Best Practices im Umgang mit Daten.
Innovation vorantreiben: Du nutzt Deine Erfahrung und Expertise, um neue datengetriebene Lösungen zu entwickeln und bestehende Prozesse zu verbessern. Genau wie unsere Systeme stehst Du nicht still und interessierst Dich für neue Technologien und Software insbesondere in den Bereichen Data Management, Data Warehousing und Big Data.
Qualität sichern: Du implementierst Best Practices für Datenqualität, Überwachung und Sicherheit, um eine zuverlässige Dateninfrastruktur sicherzustellen. Du treibst Data Governance-Themen voran und trägst du dazu bei, Regeln, Standards und Prozesse zu definieren.
Kooperation: Du arbeitest in interdisziplinären Teams, um datengetriebene Projekte erfolgreich umzusetzen und gemeinsam die Zukunft unserer Datenplattform zu gestalten und weiterzuentwickeln.

Dein Profil


Erfahrung: Du hast ein abgeschlossenes Studium mit Schwerpunkt auf Datenanalyse, Datenmanagement oder einem ähnlichen Fachgebiet und hast mehrjährige Erfahrung als Analytical Engineer (m/w/d) oder in einer ähnlichen Rolle, idealerweise in einem Umfeld mit komplexen Datenstrukturen.
Technisches Know-how: Du verfügst über fundierte Kenntnisse in der Datenmodellierung und hast bereits ELT-Prozesse in Cloud Data Warehousing-Lösungen wie BigQuery, Snowflake oder Databricks entwickelt. Zudem besitzt Du umfangreiche Erfahrung in SQL und bist mit BI-Tools, idealerweise Power BI, vertraut. Kenntnisse in den Programmiersprachen Python oder R sind ebenfalls wünschenswert.
Zusammenarbeit: Du arbeitest gerne im Team, zeigst Einsatzbereitschaft und hast Spaß daran die fachlichen Anforderungen unserer Stakeholder zu verstehen und in die Sprache der Daten zu übersetzen.
Verantwortung übernehmen: Du zeichnest Dich durch eine selbstständige und proaktive Arbeitsweise aus und übernimmst gerne Verantwortung, um Themen eigeninitiativ voranzutreiben. Dabei bist Du in der Lage, in einem dynamischen Umfeld Prioritäten klar zu setzen und effektiv zu handeln.
Problemlösungsfähigkeiten: Du kombinierst ausgeprägte analytische Fähigkeiten und ein starkes Gespür für effiziente Datenlösungen mit einem tiefgehenden Verständnis für geschäftliche Zusammenhänge und Anforderungen. Dadurch bist Du in der Lage, komplexe Probleme zielgerichtet zu lösen.
Kommunikation: Du kannst komplexe Sachverhalte klar und verständlich vermitteln und kannst diese so aufbereiten, dass sie für Kolleg:innen und Stakeholder aus verschiedenen Fachbereichen leicht nachvollziehbar sind. Du verfügst über gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse und kannst Dich somit ideal in unser multi-kulturelles Team integrieren.

We are seeking business-oriented and inquisitive data experts to help our client subdomains become data-driven. You will act as a bridge between the data team and the business, spending 80-90% of your time within the business subdomains (T/C/W).




The role primarily involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and experimentation with datasets. When stakeholders have questions, the Data Analyst (DA) will assist by querying the relevant datasets and creating Power BI dashboards to visualize the insights.




Additionally, metadata enrichment is a key responsibility. We have several datasets that lack proper documentation, so the DA will need to collaborate with subdomain business SMEs to complete the data catalog in Unity Catalog.




Some high-level data engineering tasks are also expected. For instance, the DA may need to transform multiple tables within the Databricks Unity Catalog to create aggregated tables necessary for analysis.




Moreover, the DA will be responsible for building Databricks Genie Rooms for stakeholders.

Hej från en kollega!

“Hej, jag heter Emil och jag kommer att arbeta med dig i teamet. Att arbeta på Aftonbladet & Subscription Sweden med data ger många fördelar, inklusive ett öppet förhållningssätt för att tackla utmaningar och en stark tech-gemenskap inom organisationen.

Det bästa för mig personligen är teamet. Jag är omgiven av fantastiska och mycket kompetenta kollegor som alltid är stöttande och gör det lilla extra för att hjälpa. Det finns inget vi inte kan diskutera, och det är en avslappnad och bekväm atmosfär i teamet. Johanna, vår chef, har tydliga mål om vart laget är på väg, och jag känner mig trygg med henne i spetsen. Hon är en utmärkt partner för brainstorming och har djupgående kunskap om analytics.”

We're proud to be one of the fastest-growing casino groups in Sweden, driven by a tight-knit team of industry veterans. Our success stems from innovative thinking and smart strategies, and we're always looking for new ways to stay ahead in this dynamic industry. As we embark on our next chapter, we're expanding our team and setting the stage for the future. We believe in continuous learning, embracing challenges, and creating a workspace that inspires and excites.




If you're ready to take a chance and be part of an exciting journey, we invite you to join us in shaping the future of gaming!




Role Description

As our Business Intelligence Lead, you won’t just be creating dashboards and reports on demand—you’ll be an integral part of shaping our data-driven culture. You’ll have the autonomy to define what metrics matter most, how they’re tracked, and why they’re important. Your insights will directly influence business decisions, and your ideas will help us continuously improve our operations.




You’ll collaborate with various teams across the company, from product development to customer support, to understand their data needs, develop tailored solutions, and dig into data to uncover actionable insights. This role is less about having a particular set of technical skills and more about bringing a fresh perspective, challenging the status quo, and driving innovation.




We prioritize finding the right fit for our team over specific past experiences. While we value what you’ve done before, we’re more interested in your passion, character, and alignment with our company values—qualities we believe are crucial to your success in this role.




What You'll Be Doing

Take ownership of problem-solving, data analysis, and answering business questions using tools like Excel/Sheets, SQL, Python, Superset, or any other affordable tools you're skilled with.
Develop and maintain dashboards and reports to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and support strategic decision-making.
Partner with cross-functional teams to define business challenges, gather requirements, identify data sources, and select the best tools to address these challenges.
Analyze data to identify patterns and trends, providing insights that optimize business processes and drive efficiency.
Serve as the company’s go-to expert for data and analytics, becoming the trusted resource for data-driven decision-making.
Design and maintain data models that support both tactical and strategic decision-making across the organization.
Ensure data quality and integrity by implementing and overseeing data governance processes.




Qualifications

At least two years of experience in data analysis, creating visualizations, and leveraging analytics to support business decisions.
Strong interpersonal skills, with the ability to build relationships and communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical colleagues.
Expertise in creating impactful visualizations that clearly communicate insights, whether for presentations, reports, or dashboards.
A proactive approach to your work, taking ownership of processes and outcomes, and using your experience to craft solutions and solve complex problems.




What We Offer

Be part of a forward-thinking, innovative team that’s setting the pace in the gaming industry.
Work in a collaborative environment where your insights and ideas are valued and have a direct impact on the company’s success.
Enjoy a vibrant and supportive workplace that fosters growth, creativity, and a shared commitment to excellence.
A competitive salary and incentive program
Frequent and generous company events
Possibility to work abroad (Malta)

Brinner du för att skapa insikter och affärsvärde genom data? Vi söker nu en passionerad och driven analytiker som kan bidra med både affärsförståelse med avancerade analysmetoder.




I rollen får du:

Stötta affären med strategiska och taktiska affärsanalyser
Löpande kund- och försäljningsanalyser
Leda analysprojekt; från definition av analysfrågeställning till presentation av praktiskt implementerbara insikter
Ett tätt samarbete med olika delar av organisationen för att dela med sig av affärsinsikter




Detta är en roll som är placerad i ATG:s Customer Analytics-team, och du har därigenom tillgång till all den samlade kunskap om våra kunder och möjlighet att påverka affärens utveckling.




Är det här du?

Vi kommer att lägga stor vikt vid din personlighet men för att lyckas i rollen ser vi gärna att du har en akademisk examen inom statistik, matematik, datavetenskap eller ekonomi och några års arbetslivserfarenhet med att omvandla stor mängd data till värdeskapande insikter. Du bör ha erfarenhet och kompetens av att jobba med SQL och BI-verktyg.




Vi utgår ifrån att du är van att jobba datadrivet, och proaktivt angriper problem utifrån ett faktabaserat förhållningssätt. Viktigt i rollen är att du har god affärsförståelse och förmågan att koppla ditt analysarbete till konkret nytta för såväl kunder som för vår affär.

Vidare är du noggrann, har förmåga att driva egna initiativ, tydlighet i ditt framförande och med god kommunikationsförmåga. Du ska kunna kommunicera insikter och data på ett pedagogiskt sätt till övriga i organisationen, så du ska drivas av att skapa och utveckla goda relationer.

Har du ett intresse eller erfarenhet inom sport/casino-spel är det starkt meriterande.




”Som ledare strävar jag efter att skapa en välkomnande, tillåtande miljö, där vi har stark tilltro till varandras kompetenser, uppmuntrar eget ansvar och ha nära till skratt.”

I snart nio år har jag jobbat på ATG och kan konstatera att varit en fartfylld, händelserik resa. Och resan med att utveckla Världens Bästa Spelupplevelse fortsätter i rask takt och där spelar kundanalys en central roll, vilket tilltalar mig och får mig motiverad att ständigt förbättra våra leveranser. Utöver att ATG bryr sig om sina anställa och deras välmående, uppskattar jag den offensivlusta som genomsyrar hela företaget och ambitionerna framöver. Som ledare strävar jag efter att skapa en välkommande, tillåtande miljö, där vi har stark tilltro till varandras kompetenser, uppmuntrar eget ansvar och ha nära till skratt. Utanför jobbet trivs som jag allra bäst i sällskap med min familj, gärna under en krispig, syrerik höstdag i Stockholms Skärgård!

Kambi Group plc is a leading B2B provider of premium sports betting services to licensed gaming operators. Our services provide an end-to-end solution for operators wanting to launch a standalone Sportsbook or bolster their existing offering with an innovative sports betting product. From front-end user interface to customer intelligence, risk management and odds compiling, all built on our in-house developed software, we strive to deliver the ultimate service and solution to our partners.

Our vision is to create the world’s leading sports betting experiences, together with our partners.

We are looking for an experienced Data Engineer to join Kambi’s Data Platform stream to support us in building a decentralized and self-serviced data platform, contributing to our Data Mesh journey. We believe in the high importance of data in every organization, and we are committed to empowering Kambi’s businesses through our solution.

The Role And Responsibilities

As a Data Engineer, you will help shape our data platform by connecting modern data mesh principles with the practical aspects of our current warehousing solution.

You will initially join the Data Warehouse team, however as we move forward with next delivered data products you may find yourself to work in smaller, cross-functional teams with Data Engineers and Analytics Engineers, focusing on a particular area of our unified data platform.

We believe that you have valuable experience in data modelling and transformations, which will help you understand business requirements and how they translate into data models. Experience with dbt or other modern tools will be beneficial.

As we aim to shift from Data Warehouse towards Lakehouse concept, we expect that you will be familiar with CI/CD and cloud infrastructure solutions appropriate for data platform. At Kambi we work with AWS tools, we use Airflow for orchestration, and we have recently rebuilt our Data Lake with the use of Iceberg and Trino.

Languages that we are looking for are Python and SQL for your daily work, and English for communication with your colleagues.

Is Kambi a place for you?

We highly value soft skills such as collaboration, communication, and problem-solving abilities. Our teams have a high level of autonomy in decisions around solutions and ways of working. You will thrive in this role if you are curious, enjoy technical discussions with your team and willing to collaborate to find the most suitable solution.

We offer friendly, welcoming, and inclusive working culture in an international work environment. We value learning and development, both on an individual level and as a whole organization. It is important for us that we grow together. We like to have fun with our colleagues, but we also understand that each employee needs their flexibility to thrive.

And one last thing...

We would be happy if you tick off all our boxes, yet we also believe it is just as important we tick off all of yours. And if you think you have most of what we are looking for, but not every single thing, go ahead and hit apply. We would still love to hear from you!

We want a balance between office work and working from home. We believe we will all gain from the best of both worlds, so the way of working in Kambi is hybrid – we want to have a chance to work with you in our Stockholm office 2 days in a week.

Our teams have a high level of autonomy in decisions around solutions and ways of working. You will thrive in this role if you are curious, enjoy technical discussions with your team and willing to collaborate to find the most suitable solution.<br><br>We offer friendly, welcoming, and inclusive working culture in an international work environment. We value learning and development, both on an individual level and as a whole organization. It is important for us that we grow together. We like to have fun with our colleagues, but we also understand that each employee needs their flexibility to thrive.<br><br><strong> And one last thing... <br><br></strong>We would be happy if you tick off all our boxes, yet we also believe it is just as important we tick off all of yours. And if you think you have most of what we are looking for, but not every single thing, go ahead and hit apply. We would still love to hear from you!<br><br>We want a balance between office work and working from home. We believe we will all gain from the best of both worlds, so the way of working in Kambi is hybrid – we want to have a chance to work with you in our Stockholm office 2 days in a week.<br><br>#wearekambi<br><br><strong>Kambi's ongoing commitment to Diversity and Inclusion in the workplace<br><br></strong>If you require any reasonable adjustment during the recruitment process, please notify your recruiter, who will assist you however they can.

Brinner du för att skapa insikter och affärsvärde genom data? Vi söker nu en passionerad och driven analytiker som kan bidra med både affärsförståelse med avancerade analysmetoder.




I rollen får du:

Stötta affären med strategiska och taktiska affärsanalyser
Löpande kund- och försäljningsanalyser
Leda analysprojekt; från definition av analysfrågeställning till presentation av praktiskt implementerbara insikter
Ett tätt samarbete med olika delar av organisationen för att dela med sig av affärsinsikter




Detta är en roll som är placerad i ATG:s Customer Analytics-team, och du har därigenom tillgång till all den samlade kunskap om våra kunder och möjlighet att påverka affärens utveckling.




Är det här du?

Vi kommer att lägga stor vikt vid din personlighet men för att lyckas i rollen ser vi gärna att du har en akademisk examen inom statistik, matematik, datavetenskap eller ekonomi och några års arbetslivserfarenhet med att omvandla stor mängd data till värdeskapande insikter. Du bör ha erfarenhet och kompetens av att jobba med SQL och BI-verktyg.




Vi utgår ifrån att du är van att jobba datadrivet, och proaktivt angriper problem utifrån ett faktabaserat förhållningssätt. Viktigt i rollen är att du har god affärsförståelse och förmågan att koppla ditt analysarbete till konkret nytta för såväl kunder som för vår affär.

Vidare är du noggrann, har förmåga att driva egna initiativ, tydlighet i ditt framförande och med god kommunikationsförmåga. Du ska kunna kommunicera insikter och data på ett pedagogiskt sätt till övriga i organisationen, så du ska drivas av att skapa och utveckla goda relationer.

Har du ett intresse eller erfarenhet inom sport/casino-spel är det starkt meriterande.




”Som ledare strävar jag efter att skapa en välkomnande, tillåtande miljö, där vi har stark tilltro till varandras kompetenser, uppmuntrar eget ansvar och ha nära till skratt.”

I snart nio år har jag jobbat på ATG och kan konstatera att varit en fartfylld, händelserik resa. Och resan med att utveckla Världens Bästa Spelupplevelse fortsätter i rask takt och där spelar kundanalys en central roll, vilket tilltalar mig och får mig motiverad att ständigt förbättra våra leveranser. Utöver att ATG bryr sig om sina anställa och deras välmående, uppskattar jag den offensivlusta som genomsyrar hela företaget och ambitionerna framöver. Som ledare strävar jag efter att skapa en välkommande, tillåtande miljö, där vi har stark tilltro till varandras kompetenser, uppmuntrar eget ansvar och ha nära till skratt. Utanför jobbet trivs som jag allra bäst i sällskap med min familj, gärna under en krispig, syrerik höstdag i Stockholms Skärgård!

- Filip Dyrssen, Head of Customer Analytics

Could you see yourself thriving in a dynamic global culture, working on big and innovative projects that propel the Lenus brand towards an impactful vision of making the world a happier and healthier place? Then this could be the dream job you’ve been looking for.




Why business intelligence specialist and not data analyst?

While the role involves data analysis, the primary responsibility is to co-create solutions with business stakeholders and deliver tangible value. We don’t just build and ship dashboards, we build solutions that enable our stakeholders to reach their goals. Not everything we build is a dashboard. Sometimes it’s a sheet, sometimes it’s a steamlit app, sometimes it’s a product feature, etc. We put a lot of emphasis on business understanding and continuous collaboration. We don’t just deliver numbers but take active ownership of how numbers are used and how our deliveries create value.




Who are we looking for?




Key Responsibilities

As a BI Specialist, you will join us in our Business Intelligence and Data team in Copenhagen and you will:

Identify and design solutions that improve business performance and operational efficiency.
Be responsible for the entire process from requirement identification till successful adoption of deliverables.
Collaborate with stakeholders across business functions (Finance, Marketing, Sales amongst others) to understand data requirements and identify process improvement opportunities.
Design functional and easily interpretable visualizations that drive decision making.
Conduct workshops to educate teams on how to incorporate data in their daily processes.
Work with a high level of autonomy.




Qualifications

You are keen to work on a modern tech stack that is constantly evolving to better meet our business's rapid growth. We use BigQuery as our data warehouse, DBT to organise our business logic and Tableau to primarily visualize all of our data and insights.
You are familiar with Tableau or PowerBI - with some work experience in building the dashboards, preferably from a student position (up to 2 years of relevant experience from a full-time job position is also welcome).
You have a masters in business or a technical masters with some introductory business courses.
You are familiar with SQL to model large datasets.
You are the kind of person that is curious, proactive and a quick learner with solid business understanding.
You love visualizing complex datasets.
You have experience and/or willingness to work in a fast-paced agile environment.
You are motivated by professional challenges and intellectual sparring.




The Team

You will be a valued member of our close-knit team consisting of Data Scientists, BI Specialists and Data Engineers.

Our team is driven by excellent cooperation and dynamic sparring. We take ownership of our projects, come up with new ideas and strive to deliver with the highest quality. Our team is trusted with a great amount of responsibility and we take pride in our autonomous way of working. We trust each other to speak up if feeling stuck or if a new perspective is needed and you’ll find us chatting and sparring throughout the day. As a majority of the team are expats we have naturally become a part of each other’s lives outside Lenus through monthly board game nights, sports activities, team dinners, boat trips, etc.

If you recognize yourself in a setting like this, we’d love to have you on board!




Benefits & Perks

Structured and prioritised development opportunities
Development feedback cycle with quarterly check ins
Team events and monthly social events in all our offices
Company wide events like our summer party, end of year party and Lenus birthday party!
Sports and activities, like paddle tournaments, Workout Wednesdays, Run & Dip, and much more!
Daily snacks and fuel. Our offices are set up with fruits, snack bars, and a selection of drinks
A Macbook and other hardware to support you in your daily work
Mandatory insurance through AP Pension
Voluntary pension plan




We'll be going through applications frequently, so if this sounds like a great opportunity for you, hit apply and our talent team will go through it and be in touch with you. We look forward to reading your application.

ICA Level: IICA-1/LICA-9

Duty station: Copenhagen, Denmark

Duration: 01/10/2024 - 31/12/2024 (with possibility of extension)

General Background

UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is a global organization dedicated to saving lives, protecting rights, and building a better future for refugees, forcibly displaced communities, and stateless people.

     

The Statistics, Data Science, and Survey Section (SDSS) located in UNHCR’s Global Data Service (GDS) in Copenhagen oversees the production of global statistics on forcibly displaced and stateless populations. Access to reliable, timely and accurate data is essential to achieve the aims of the Data Transformation Strategy 2020-2025, that is, to position UNHCR as a trusted leader on data and information related to refugees and other populations of concern. The Section develops external products such as the annual Global Trends report, which analyzes the changes in forced displacement and statelessness and deepens public understanding of ongoing crises, and maintains the Refugee Data Finder, which enables humanitarian workers, decision-makers, researchers, and many more to quickly access data and information on affected populations. The Section ensures that quality and coherent data related to forced displacement is systematically, responsibly, and efficiently collected, analyzed, and presented by UNHCR and its partners.

Increasingly, UNHCR’s approach to strengthen statistics, data and information systems is based on collaboration and collective efforts with partners and stakeholders, as the optimal way to both ensure the effective use of resources and to achieve outcomes for those affected by forced displacement.

At global level, UNHCR is a member of several multi-stakeholder statistical expert groups, ensuring that forcibly displaced people are visible in global statistical recommendations and reporting, through disaggregation of data by forced displacement status and, through the custodian role of a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator. SDSS has taken a leading role in the Expert Group on Refugee, IDP and Statelessness Statistics (EGRISS), both as a steering committee member and host of the secretariat. EGRISS is a multistakeholder group, which was established by the UN Statistical Commission in 2016 to develop recommendations to improve official statistics on forced displacement and statelessness. UNHCR coordinates the activities of the group together with other steering committee members, consisting of organizations from country, regional and international levels. In addition, SDSS is co-leading the work of the EGRISS subgroup on capacity building on forced displacement statistics.

The section is a key member of the International Data Alliance for Children on the Move (IDAC), a platform that brings together diverse stakeholders working at the nexus between data and the topics of migration, forced displacement, human mobility, development, and child protection. It is led by a joint Secretariat comprised of UNICEF as Chair, UNHCR, IOM, Eurostat, and OECD. UNHCR is also a member of its capacity building and technical guidance working group.

Through the above-mentioned initiatives, UNHCR works closely with global, regional, and national partners to strengthen capacity on how to collect and compile official statistics on forced displacement and to improve the quality and availability of such statistics.

Access to reliable, timely and accurate data is essential to achieve the aims of the Data Transformation Strategy 2020-2025, that is, to position UNHCR as a trusted leader on data and information related to refugees and other populations of concern. The Section develops external products such as the annual Global Trends report, which analyzes the changes in forced displacement and statelessness and deepens public understanding of ongoing crises, and maintains the Refugee Data Finder, which enables humanitarian workers, decision-makers, researchers, and many more to quickly access data and information on affected populations.

SDSS has taken a leading role in the Expert Group on Refugee, IDP and Statelessness Statistics (EGRISS), both as a steering committee member and host of the secretariat. EGRISS is a multistakeholder group, which was established by the UN Statistical Commission in 2016 to develop recommendations to improve official statistics on forced displacement and statelessness. UNHCR coordinates the activities of the group together with other steering committee members, consisting of organizations from country, regional and international levels. In addition, SDSS is co-leading the work of the EGRISS subgroup on capacity building on forced displacement statistics.<br><br>The section is a key member of the International Data Alliance for Children on the Move (IDAC), a platform that brings together diverse stakeholders working at the nexus between data and the topics of migration, forced displacement, human mobility, development, and child protection.

Our Mission

At Consumer Panel Services GfK, our mission is clear: to provide key information on who buys what, where, how much, how often, and most importantly, why (or why not). We take pride in delivering high-quality, uninterrupted data, expert consultancy, and unparalleled expertise to empower our clients to deliver superior customer experiences at every stage of the shopper journey.

Job Description

Our Consumer Panel Services (CPS) team, now part of YouGov, manages a panel of 3.000 families in Denmark. These households continuously register their groceries with the use of our reporting solution, an app called MyScan.

In an exciting new initiative, CPS is more than doubling the panel by partnering up with Heco who have developed an app called Optius to passively collect purchase data. By adding those passively collected data to our existing panel, CPS will be able to deliver an unprecedented level of detail to FMCG and retail clients.

The Data & Quality Specialist will support in matching the CPS purchase database to the passively measured data and vice versa, based on an algorithm and improved manually where needed . The Data & Quality Specialist will pair passive data from the Optius app with big data from our CPS database and maintain data quality through rigorous quality checking and adjustment. The Data & Quality Specialist will improve database coding through accurate classification and measurement. The Data & Quality Specialist will regularly analyse their work and identify ways to improve data quality and further evolve classification, collaborating with other Data & Operations colleagues to develop comprehensive processes & techniques to drive best practice.

Det er en stilling, hvor fokus vil være på at få struktureret data, samt at få udrullet data til forretningen gennem rapporter i Power BI.

Dataanalytiker i Økonomi

Som Dataanalytiker kommer du i samarbejde med vores anden dataanalytiker til at blive indgangsvinklen for teamets arbejde med Power BI og datahåndtering i kuber. Du får en nøglerolle i at realisere, at de øvrige controllere får værktøjer, som gør at de kan formidle viden på den mest optimale måde til forretningen samtidig med, at data bliver udstillet og gjort tilgængelig for ledere.

Dine primære arbejdsopgaver omfatter, at du:


Udvikler og kvalitetssikrer BI-platform for HR
Transformerer de nuværende finansdata og udstiller dem i Power BI
Sikrer at de udstillede rapporter/datakilder til en hver tid er valideret og retvisende
Optimerer og udvikler den nuværende rapportering visuelt



Dataforståelse og visualiseringsevner

Vi søger en dygtig dataanalytiker, fx cand. merc, eller tilsvarende uddannelse. Du skal være skarp til Excel og helst have kendskab til Business Intelligence og visualiseringsværktøjer som Power BI. Har du arbejdet med Access og SQL, er det en fordel, men ikke et krav.

Vi er åbne for både nyuddannede og erfarne kandidater. Det vigtigste for os er, at du har en passion for dataanalyse og har en interesse i at udvikle dine færdigheder. Hvis du motiveres af at nørde med data, vil læringen også komme naturligt.

Vi forventer derudover, at du:


Har en god forståelse for data – struktur, modellering og udstilling
Ønsker at arbejde med best practice for principper for datavisualisering



Som person er du struktureret, selvkørende og kan planlægge din egen tid, så du formår at sikre fremdrift i dine opgaver og projekter. Du besidder gode analytiske færdigheder og vil trives med at samarbejde med mange datakilder i forretningen.

Vi ser frem til at byde dig velkommen

Du bliver en del af teamet FP&A, som består af 8 medarbejdere, der gerne vil hinanden. I teamet har vi et stort fokus på at have det sjovt, såvel på arbejdet men også gennem fejring af succeser ved sociale arrangementer uden for arbejdstiden.

Der er frie rammer og en stor interesse i at støtte hinanden i teamet, samtidig med at vi sætter en stor ære i at holde en høj faglighed. Teamet er en del af et velfungerende økonomiområde med mere end 60 engagerede medarbejdere.

Vi har et fleksibelt arbejdsmiljø og giver plads og mulighed for hjemmearbejde efter aftale med nærmeste leder. Hos os er der plads til dig, og til at du har et bæredygtigt arbejdsliv.

Du kan læse mere om vores medarbejdergoder her

Bliv en del af HOFOR og vær med til at gøre en forskel

Er du klar til nye muligheder, så ser vi frem til at modtage dit cv på 1-2 sider, hvor du blot tilføjer nogle linjer om din motivation for at søge stillingen. En egentlig ansøgning er derfor ikke et krav.

Ansøgningsfristen er sødang den 15. september 2024, og vi afholder 1. samtale den 19. september 2024 og 2. samtale den 25.-27. september 2024.

Har du spørgsmål til jobbet, er du velkommen til at kontakte teamleder Michael Lund Sahl på tlf. 2795 2146 eller mail mics@hofor.dk.

Send din ansøgning ved at klikke på ”Søg stillingen” i højre side.

Er jobbet ikke det rette match for dig?

Hvis dette job ikke er det rette match for dig, vil vi opfordre dig til at dele jobannoncen med andre i dit netværk, der kunne finde stillingen interessant. Tag også et kig på vores andre ledige stillinger her - måske vi har det rette job til dig.

Hos os får du plads

Vand, varme, hverdag. I HOFOR sikrer vi forsyningen i hovedstadsområdet. Men vores ansvar rækker længere: Vi skaber fremtidens bæredygtige byer. Det kræver overskud, og derfor giver vi dig plads. Plads til at forfølge de store ideer og til at hente de små. Plads til at dyrke de faglige detaljer og til at tegne de store linjer. Plads til at hjælpe hinanden og til at tænke nyt, når der er brug for det. Vi har plads til flere og til, at du kan være med.

HOFOR. Hos os får du plads. Til fællesskab, udvikling og et bæredygtigt arbejdsliv.

Inkluderende kultur og rekruttering

I HOFOR arbejder vi på at skabe en inkluderende kultur, og vi leder efter dygtige kollegaer uanset udseende, køn, kønsidentitet, seksuel orientering, etnicitet, religion, handicap, alder osv. Vi vil gerne skabe lige muligheder for alle samt sikre en retfærdig rekrutteringsproces. Undlad venligst at vedhæfte et billede.

Har du motivation for at lære og udvikle dig i en voksende dataafdeling? Så er jobbet som Data Engineer noget for dig.




Jobbet

Som Data Engineer i Dataplatform får du en central rolle i udviklingen og vedligeholdelsen af vores eksisterende dataplatform. Vi har fået vores første erfaringer med dataarbejde i skyen, og skal videre med udviklingen. Teamet er ansvarligt for vores nuværende dataplatform (placeret både on-premise og i en Azure cloud), samt at drive og vedligeholde vores SAS-driftsetup.




Dine primære arbejdsopgaver vil derfor være:

Vedligeholdelse af data på SQL-servere (primært Azure)
Optimering og strukturering af data på Azure
Datamigrering fra on-prem til Cloud
Drift og sparring til løsninger ift. anvendelse og strukturering af data
Dokumentation af vores platform
Datasparringspartner i projekter




Din profil

Der er mange veje ind til jobbet. Vi forventer, at du er serviceorienteret, har stor interesse for data, samt har lyst til at udfordre nuværende måder at gøre tingene på. Derudover skal du have lyst til at lære vores eksisterende dataplatform at kende, og tage ansvar for dens anvendelse.

Vi forestiller os, at du gerne har;




Erfaring med SAS
Erfaring med Microsoft SQL
Erfaring i udviklingen af MSSQL Views og Stored Procedures
Erfaring med at arbejde i Azure DevOps




Kendskab til BEC-samarbejdet og bank er kun en fordel. Det også en fordel hvis du kender andre kodesprog herunder Python eller har arbejdet med snowflake eller Databricks.

Vi forventer desuden at du har gode samarbejds- og kommunikationsevner, da værdien af data skabes sammen med andre. Derudover forventer vi, at du kan arbejde selvstændigt og struktureret. Det er et krav, at du behersker dansk i skrift og tale.




Dataplatform

Vi værdsætter din karriereudvikling og tilbyder adgang til en bred vifte af læringsressourcer. Som en del af vores team vil du have mulighed for at udvikle dine færdigheder og vokse professionelt i et miljø, der støtter innovation og personlig udvikling.

Teamet består af 7 Data Engineers og er en del af bankens Data og Modeller afdeling, som rummer over 30 dataentusiaster. Vi er kendetegnet ved godt samarbejde og sparring i hverdagen. Vi tager tid til fælles opgaveafklaring og opgavemøder, har retrospektiv med fokus på teamlæring, samt har interne demo og review med fokus at kunne fordybe sig i detaljerne.




Teamet er centralt beliggende i Panoptikonbygningen, Banegårdspladsen 1 – lige overfor Tivoli og 2 min. gang fra Københavns Hovedbanegård. Der også mulighed for lejlighedsvis at arbejde hjemmefra. Fra 2025 sidder vi alle samlet i vores helt nye hovedkontor på Sluseholmen.




Vi tilbyder en attraktiv arbejdsplads

I Arbejdernes Landsbank bliver du del af en kultur, hvor stærke værdier som ordentlighed, fællesskab og åbenhed er i fokus. Derudover kan du se frem til at blive del af:

En arbejdsplads hvor arbejdsglæden og medarbejdertilfredsheden er blandt de højeste i sektoren
En arbejdsplads, som er rangeret #3 ud af Danmarks 25 største pengeinstitutter målt på det bedste image som arbejdsplads i 2023
En bank som 15 år i træk er kåret til danskernes foretrukne bank
En flad organisationsstruktur med hurtige beslutningsprocesser
En vækstorienteret organisation, hvor der er rig mulighed for at udvikle sig både fagligt og personligt




Du får desuden en lang række medarbejdergoder, som bl.a. omfatter sundhedsforsikring, tandforsikring og ekstra ferietillæg.




Er du interesseret?

Hvis du gerne vil have mere information om stillingen, kan du ringe til leder af Dataplatform Mattias Westergaard Clausen på tlf. nr. 2370 1741 eller sende en mail til mawc@al-bank.dk.

Allica is the UK’s fastest growing company - and the fastest-growing financial technology (fintech) firm ever. Our purpose is to help established SMEs, one of the last major underserved opportunities in fintech. Established SMEs are the backbone of local communities - representing over a third of our economy - yet have been largely neglected both by traditional high street banks and modern fintech providers




Role Description

Data is a key asset to Allica and is deeply embedded in all our teams and products. With data, we assist and work with Finance, Operations, Credit Risk, Product and management. This role will be for the Lending Tribe.




We are looking for ambitious and curious people who can help us understand our data better, contribute to facilitating the discussions between engineering and the data stakeholders and have an impact on the business by telling stories around the insights they generate.




You will be an integral part of the lending data squad, and the initial focus will be scaling up our ability to deliver analytics/insights that shape our understanding of the business and enhancing our foundations for automated reporting




Principal Accountabilities

Understand our products and processes through the data we have or collect
Work with the Lending Tribe and other stakeholders (Ops, risk, etc) to understand their data needs and provide solutions that address the core need (not just the immediate request)
Contribute meaningful insights from our data that proactively drive decisions and new lines of inquiry
Build visualizations and reports that enable the Lending business to service their ongoing data needs and measure KPIs
Develop data knowledge base (definitions, working rhythms etc.) within the team that enables us to become an information hub for the business




Personal Attributes & Experience

Previous experience working as a data analyst (in finance is desirable but not essential)
You like to investigate and challenge narratives using data
The ability to write queries in SQL with logic to combine multiple data sources
You work well with stakeholders across the business.
You communicate effectively and are comfortable with learning how to translate technical detail into business and commercial language.
You have a solid foundation in Python programming OR a strong desire to learn




Don’t tick every box?

Don’t worry if you don’t have all the skills or requirements listed on the job description. If you think you’ll be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you!




Flexible working

We know the ‘9-to-5’ isn’t right for everyone. That’s why Allica Bank is fully committed to flexible and hybrid working. Please let us know what is best for you and, if we can, we will do our best to accommodate.




Diversity

We’re a diverse bunch here at Allica, with all kinds of experiences, backgrounds and lifestyles. Our openness and differences make us stronger, and we want everybody to feel comfortable bringing as much of themselves to work with them as they like.

Analytics is the compass that guides Sephora on its strategic journey, and we are on the lookout for a Data Analyst who can harness the power of data to propel our business forward. As a Data Analyst, you'll play a critical role in analyzing and interpreting customer data to drive business decisions across our digital platforms. Leveraging your strong experience in BigQuery SQL, you'll craft scripts that seamlessly integrate back-end data with Google Analytics 4 for in-depth customer analysis and segmentation.




Your expertise in data modeling will enable you to map out data structures that support the creation and maintenance of dashboards and reports, tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) related to online engagement, traffic, conversion rates, and marketing effectiveness. In this role, you'll work with data visualization tools like Power BI and Google Data Studio to develop compelling visual reports that convey complex insights in a clear and actionable manner. Additionally, you'll ensure the accuracy and quality of data, while effectively communicating your insights to non-technical stakeholders.







You will also be responsible for:

Writing and optimizing BigQuery SQL scripts for GA4 analysis, integrating back-end data to segment and analyze customer data.
Developing and maintaining dashboards and regular weekly/monthly reports to track KPIs related to performance, online engagement, A/B testing, traffic, conversion rates, marketing attribution, and campaign effectiveness.
Using data visualization tools such as Power BI and Google Data Studio to create clear, actionable insights for stakeholders.
Engaging in data modeling to effectively map out data structures that support business goals.
Utilizing digital analytics tools like Google Analytics and Quantum Metric to deliver data-driven recommendations.
Ensuring the accuracy and quality of data while drawing insightful conclusions and making strategic recommendations.







What You'll Bring







Your passion for detail is matched by your logical thinking and curiosity. You not only obsess over details but also possess the agility to communicate improvements rapidly and clearly. You thrive in an ever-evolving landscape, where driving innovation and continuous improvement is paramount. We are looking for a detail-oriented Data Analyst with strong analytical skills, capable of working both independently and collaboratively within a dynamic team environment.

We value ambition paired with a logical mindset—individuals who are curious, inquisitive, and able to articulate suggestions with precision. You will utilize your strong foundation in BigQuery SQL, particularly in GA4 analysis, coupled with hands-on experience in data visualization using tools like Power BI. Your deep understanding of digital analytics, especially within Ecommerce and Retail, will enable you to provide actionable insights that drive business success. Your proficiency in digital analytics tools such as Google Analytics and Quantum Metric will be essential in providing recommendations that optimize performance.







Our ideal candidate will also possess:

Proficiency in Google Analytics, Quantum Metric, or similar digital analytics platforms.
Experience with Google Marketing Platform.
Strong communication skills, both written and verbal, for conveying complex data insights to non-technical stakeholders.
An eye for detail and a commitment to data accuracy and quality.
Familiarity with Google Tag Manager, A/B testing tools, competitor research using market share tools, setting up data feed APIs, and UX platforms would be advantageous.







While at Sephora, You’ll Enjoy...







The people. You will be surrounded by some of the most talented leaders and teams – people you can be proud to work with.
The learning. We invest in training and developing our teams, and you will continue evolving and building your skills through personalized career plans.
The culture. As a leading beauty retailer within the LVMH family, our reach is broad, and our impact is global. It is in our DNA to innovate and, at Sephora, all 40,000 passionate team members across 35 markets and 3,000 stores, are united by a common goal - to reimagine the future of beauty.

About the Role




We are DataOps advocates and use software engineering best practices to build scalable and re-usable data solutions to help clients use their data to gain insights, drive decisions and deliver business value.

About You




You're an engineer at heart and enjoy the challenge of building reliable, efficient data applications systems, services and platforms.
You have a good understanding of coding best practices and design patterns and experience with code and data versioning, dependency management, code quality and optimisation, error handling, logging, monitoring, validation and alerting.
You have experience in writing well tested object-oriented Python.
You have experience with using CI/CD tooling to analyse, build, test and deploy your code.
You have a good understanding of design choices for data storage and data processing, with a particular focus on cloud data services.
You have experience in using parallel computing to process large datasets and to optimise computationally intensive tasks.
You have experience in programmatically deploying, scheduling and monitoring components in a workflow.
You have experience in writing complex queries against relational and non-relational data stores.
