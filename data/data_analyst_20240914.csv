Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

THE SMALL PRINT WE WANT YOU TO BE AWARE OF

T&C is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer.

We’re building the next generation of recruiting software and we’re starting with a suite of products that helps talent leaders, recruiters, and hiring managers run an efficient and data-driven hiring process.

We are well-funded and backed by great investors, including Y Combinator, Elad Gil and Lachy Groom. We have over 1,500 amazing customers including Ramp, Notion, OpenAI and Zapier – yet we've only taken the first steps toward a much larger opportunity. In short, it's the perfect time to join! 🚀

About This Role

👋 Hi, I’m Kevin, I manage the data team and analytics products at Ashby. With Ashby’s ongoing growth we’re entering a new phase where the role of data will become more important than ever before. With that in mind, I’m looking for a talented data analyst to join our dynamic team!

As a data analyst at Ashby you’ll primarily be focused on product-related analytical questions. This will cover the gamut of most standard analyses and related assets (analysis summaries, metric monitoring, dashboards, etc). Given Ashby is well-positioned to capture global recruiting data, our product analyses naturally lend themselves to global job market benchmark reports which are highly valuable to Ashby and the broader employer and candidate job markets (see our Talent Trends for some examples).

Your responsibilities will cover the whole data funnel: starting from raw or lightly modeled data all the way through final analysis summary. When appropriate, you will be responsible for analysis work that become standardized internal dashboards for other Ashby team members. All in, you will have broad analytical ownership and responsibilities, so this is a role best fit for a curious and ambitious type that enjoys touching the whole data analysis ecosystem.

If you are a product-minded analyst, given Ashby supports a whole recruiting analytics product line there is a very real potential that your internal analysis work could contribute directly to our product. This is not a requirement, but I see it as a genuinely likely possibility and an added bonus.

Data Culture at Ashby

At Ashby, we draw a clear distinction between when to look to data for ""the answer"" and when to use data to aid principled thinking for decision making. In general, a primary consideration is whether or not data is needed to help clarify points of uncertainty. When data is considered necessary, a secondary consideration is to what depth data will be required. Data questions lend themselves to ongoing what about... or what if... explorations, which can be important in some situations but are not always necessary. With these dynamics in mind, we do not foster an environment where every decision we make should be backed by data, but we do foster an environment where teammates ask whether or not data will fit the task at hand well. This, in turn, allows us to operate a lean team focused on projects where data provides true leverage to our overall business and product goals.

As a related but distinct point, Ashby’s data culture as far as transparency and access goes is very open. We share company-wide access to our financial standings, progress, and goals and generally make any data and reporting we do consider valuable broadly available. Outside of constraints related to whether a teammate has access to a particular tool, there are close to no constraints on access the state of the company as told by data or reporting. In general, we would like to continue and extend open access to data throughout the company (with your help!), but with consideration and not as a substitute for principled thinking :)

Requirements

The essence of this role dictates you must be analytical, conversant in statistical reasoning, capable of managing the data you work with and distilling results into the appropriate downstream assets. There are a lot of ways to meet those responsibilities. If the dot product of your skill vector with this requirements vector is close to 1, please consider applying, but please note it does not have to be 1.0.


Expertise in SQL-based data analysis
Strong in analytical and statistical thinking - you must be able to generate insights
Expertise with data visualization (i.e. visual communication of results)
Proficiency in Python (primarily in the domain of data analysis and visualization)
Interest in working directly with business partners, e.g. product or go-to-market teammates, to identify and plan related analysis efforts
Proficiency building internal “data products” based on your analysis results, e.g. high-usage dashboards via BI tools (Looker, Tableau, etc) for various business partners
Excellent written and verbal communication. Ashby has a writing-centric culture, but you will also be responsible for direct collaboration with various teammates
Very detail-oriented: in your analysis work you can anticipate complications and identify bad-but-not-obviously-wrong data discrepancies
Experience modeling and working with product analytics events


You could be a great fit if


You identify as exceptionally curious by nature
You could pass as an “analytics engineer” or have working proficiency in dbt-based data modeling
You have been a first or early data analyst at a growing, fast-moving startup
You have working experience in B2B SaaS and understand how analysis facilitates business success
You have an intuition for solving problems pragmatically and an eye for leverage
You enjoy collaboration and find reward in enabling other teammates to succeed
You have strong, experience-backed opinions about data products and data culture in a company setting
Familiarity with our data stack is a bonus, but not a requirement
Have a passion for refining the role of data within company environments, spanning everything from communication standards and data request management - you’ll help shape this as Ashby grows
You can appreciate the whole distribution as much as a point estimator


Reasons not to apply


You do not enjoy working directly with analysts or other business stakeholders. This role will require working closely and in earnest with teammates across the company as various data-related needs come up.
You are looking for consumer-scale data infrastructure projects. We have a huge and interesting set of data to work with (check out our data trends reports!), but we are a B2B SaaS company. Relative to B2C services, we might best be considered small but mighty :)
You are seeking an in-person work experience. Although there are hot spots of Ashby employees around the world, Ashby is a remote workplace. Rest assured, we do meet up in person for various events throughout the year!
You want to be on a large team of analysts. The data team at Ashby is lean, so you will be primarily working with a data engineering partner and your manager (me!). That said, you will be working directly with many team members across the company, so your teammates in the analysis sense will be the diversity of folks you collaborate with on analysis to analysis.


Ashby's Data Stack

As it will undoubtedly be a point of interest, a quick summary of our data stack is provided here. Our production database is postgres, which we integrate into a Snowflake data warehouse via a custom data pipeline. All other business systems are integrated via Fivetran. We use Prefect for orchestration and dbt for data modeling. Frontend event tracking is done via Rudderstack. Data visualization and reporting varies, but the broader company is primarily served standardized analytics via Looker. For version control we use Git/Github (and Github Actions for CI/CD). As an Analyst, you'll be at liberty to work in a notebook or tool of your choice. Internal documentation lives in Slab.

Interview Process

Our interview process is thorough — we aim to ensure each person that joins the team is the right fit for Ashby and will provide ample information for you to assess if Ashby is the right fit for you. The process for this role is as follows:


Hiring Manager Screen - 30 to 45 min
Take home mini-analysis & review
Final Round - about 2.5 to 3 hours (can do multi-day)


Note: please do not reach out to the broader Ashby team requesting more information or time to connect. We will diligently review all applications in detail after the public posting period is over.

Benefits


Competitive salary and equity.
10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.
Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it 😅.
Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.
Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!
$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.
If you’re in the US, top-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us.


Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.

If you've made it this far and are excited about Ashby, please apply and follow us on LinkedIn to stay up to date!

Compensation Range: $120K - $150K

Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It’s where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you’ll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You’ll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Creating a life you love also means finding a career that celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences that you bring. As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

The mission of the Business Operations team is to assess how well Pinterest’s strategy is delivering enterprise performance and influence exec-level decisions to evolve strategy and operations accordingly. As the Lead Data Analyst (Trust & Safety), you will shape and deliver on the analytical agenda that provides critical business insights for our Exec Team while partnering with Product, Engineering, Data Science, and others to improve how we execute. With a combination of exceptional analytical skills, insatiable curiosity, and strong partnering skills, you’ll help us better understand how to keep Pinterest a safe, inspiring platform and drive changes that shape its future.

What You’ll Do


Business Analytics & Reporting. Develop a deep understanding of the Trust & Safety challenges and roadmap and how they drive our business / user experience to inform important decisions and priorities across the organization. Define critical KPIs and build core operating dashboards to help teams drive operational rigor and manage performance. Be the primary point person with our senior leadership on understanding metrics movements and trends in our business.
Strategy & Special Projects. Tackle key strategic questions and critical business initiatives, and partner with leaders throughout Pinterest to build business cases for potential investments. Present insights and recommendations to senior leadership, and drive the “follow through” of those recommendations to ensure smooth execution with a diverse array of cross-functional partners.
Planning & Forecasting. Manage the forecast models for core topline metrics that drive company-wide forecasting, goal-setting, and strategic planning. Work with senior leaders to update their strategic priorities and goals on a regular basis.



What We’re Looking For


Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as economics, business administration, or data analytics or equivalent experience. MBA optional
7+ years of experience in analytical or strategic roles with at least 2 years in Trust & Safety. You’ve been a top performer in an analytical role and have a strong background in and passion for Trust & Safety.
Exceptional data analysis skills. You’re a true expert in a variety of analytical tools, including SQL, Tableau, and Excel (and in areas you’re not, you have the growth mindset to learn it); knowledge of Python and R is a plus.
Entrepreneurial self-starter. You thrive in a fast-moving, ambiguous environment, and are independently capable of seeking information, corralling resources, and delivering results without waiting for direction.
Strong communication skills. You can move seamlessly between conversing with engineers or frontline ops employees and leading presentations with senior executives.
High-energy, positive team player. You have a proven ability to build strong working relationships with business partners; this is a highly cross-functional role, so a low ego and a high instinct for collaboration are musts.
Keen aptitude to scale the team. Help build out processes for a small (but mighty) team. Help build our influence across the organization to tackle each of the above for your coverage area.



Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement

At Pinterest we believe the workplace should be equitable, inclusive, and inspiring for every employee.

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Stio® is an omni-channel mountain brand that designs, develops and sells beautiful, functional, and innovative apparel, footwear and other accessories infused with the soul of the mountain lifestyle. With headquarters in Jackson, Wyoming, Stio draws inspiration from the surrounding Teton Range and offers product via Stio.com, catalog and its Mountain Studio® retail locations.

We live and love mountain life, and as such see ourselves as caretakers of the resources that provide it. We are proud partners of Protect Our Winters and the Conservation Alliance among many other organizations. We have a strong preferred materials platform, use Bluesign® approved textiles wherever possible, audit our supply chains for best practices, and operate our workplaces responsibly.

We think that outside is the best side and that you can't improve on nature. It's good for mind, body and soul, and it's our responsibility to help enable access for all people, regardless of race, gender, beliefs, background or ability. We strive for inclusion at Stio and in our local and national communities.

YOUR ROLE

The Data Analyst will be an important player in enhancing Stio's ability to leverage data to inform decision making across the company. This is a full-stack analyst position with an end-to-end focus: the work ranges from helping to build foundational data infrastructure to diving deep into specific functional areas to guide business strategy. As an early member of a growing analytics team, the Data Analyst will have the chance to make a broad, tangible impact on our infrastructure, processes, and analysis projects. Working closely with a variety of teams from finance and operations to marketing and product development, the Data Analyst will analyze business performance using existing tools, then design better ones. They will help shape our data into more useful forms and work to tie analysis to action.

We are looking for a detail-oriented analyst who can connect what they see in the data to the bigger picture. The right candidate is someone who doesn't hesitate to sweep the floor (e.g., fix a broken Excel link) and isn't afraid to think outside the box (e.g., does this metric actually measure what is intended?). A foundation of technical skills is essential, but even more important is an eagerness to learn new things and a desire to drive positive progress at Stio.

This is a remote role that is part of the Finance department and reports to the Senior Business Analyst.

Your Responsibilities


Ownership of seasonal reporting and analysis that informs go-to-market product strategy (e.g., product returns reporting, product color performance analysis)
Creation and maintenance of business intelligence dashboards that support departments across the company
Assist in building and maintaining Stio's data infrastructure (currently Fivetran, Microsoft Fabric, Spark/SQL/dbt, R, Power BI in addition to Excel and various data sources)
Conducting ad hoc analysis to better understand business performance both proactively and in support of senior leadership questions
Automating manual reporting and analysis tasks
Improving data governance by creating documentation for both processes and data objects
Continuous learning to improve knowledge of technical best practices



Your Skills And Experience


3+ years of relevant past professional experience as a data analyst, business analyst, or similar role
Advanced Excel skills (e.g., pivot tables, various lookup functions, comfortable writing efficient formulas, easily-to-follow work)
Experience as a developer with at least one BI tool (e.g., Power BI, Tableau)
A minimum of intermediate SQL skills required (e.g., grouping and aggregations, case statements, joins)
Experience creating presentations and communicating analysis findings to leadership (verbally, written, and visually)

We are looking for a Data Analyst to join our fast-growing Implementation Team.

The role will give you a lot of exposure and interaction directly with the customer, build up know-how around Enterprise systems and integrations. You will work with some of the world's leading organisations (EDF Energy, BAE Systems, Novartis, Mondelez, etc.) with HICX on some of the most challenging projects. 

Responsibilities

Collect, clean, and analyze data from various sources using SQL, Java, Python, and other tools
Create and maintain ETL scripts to handle data transformations for data migration and integration
Develop and maintain data models, dashboards, and reports to communicate insights to stakeholders
Prepare customized reports and dashboards using analytical tools to facilitate effective decision making
Work with cross-functional teams to identify areas for improvement and develop recommendations based on data analysis
Collaborate with other team members to ensure data accuracy and consistency across various systems and tools
Engage in application surveillance and monitoring and reacting appropriately under SLAs
Assist with ad-hoc data analysis requests as needed by the business



Requirements



Essential{{:}}

2 years+ experience in a data analysis role in Procurement, Supply Chain, Manufacturing, or a related field
Proficiency in SQL
Proficiency in Excel including vlookups and pivot tables
Experience using data analysis tools such as Power BI or Tableau
Experience with data visualization and dashboard development
Strong analytical skills and ability to use data to inform decision-making
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
Proficient in spoken and written English
CV must be in English

Desirable{{:}}

Experience with JSON, XML, SOAP, REST technologies
Knowledge of data warehousing concepts and data model design
Experience with ERP and SaaS platforms (SAP, Oracle, Infor M3, Coupa)
Experience in a programming language such as Java, Python, C# or .NET
Experience in applied analytics and Machine learning/AI techniques
Certifications in data analysis, SQL, or related fields are a plus




You'll love this role if...

You're excited about the prospect of working with Supplier Data in the Procurement and Supply Chain domain
You're passionate about analyzing data and drawing insights that will impact business decisions
You enjoy solving problems and don't mind going through multiple iterations until you get the best solution possible
You thrive in a continuous learning environment and keep up to date with the latest trends in your field
You're excited about learning from multiple industries and practices as you work through different data domains




You may not like this role if...

You like working independently as much as possible and don't like deadlines - this role requires that you collaborate in cross-functional teams to deliver work across one or more projects to satisfy clients and stakeholders
You are not interested with interacting with business stakeholders - the ability to understand the business context is key to this role as you will not only need to navigate the data but also know how to prepare the data in such a way that can be used by the business for analysis and insight
You expect clear instructions to perform your role - as a data analyst, you may often need to perform your role with limited context and information, and you will need to be open to seeking this out and iterating through multiple solutions
You do not like going through the process of cleaning and transforming - data analysts know the reality of how much work needs to be put in to get data to a readily available state and you need to be ready to take on that challenge
You do not like debugging SQL queries or find the prospect of seeing large pieces of code scary - to be able to confidently triage, investigate, and resolve issues effectively, debugging is a core part in a data analyst's workstream.

We are looking for a Data Analyst to join our fast-growing Implementation Team.

The role will give you a lot of exposure and interaction directly with the customer, build up know-how around Enterprise systems and integrations. You will work with some of the world's leading organisations (EDF Energy, BAE Systems, Novartis, Mondelez, etc.) with HICX on some of the most challenging projects. 

Responsibilities

Collect, clean, and analyze data from various sources using SQL, Java, Python, and other tools
Create and maintain ETL scripts to handle data transformations for data migration and integration
Develop and maintain data models, dashboards, and reports to communicate insights to stakeholders
Prepare customized reports and dashboards using analytical tools to facilitate effective decision making
Work with cross-functional teams to identify areas for improvement and develop recommendations based on data analysis
Collaborate with other team members to ensure data accuracy and consistency across various systems and tools
Engage in application surveillance and monitoring and reacting appropriately under SLAs
Assist with ad-hoc data analysis requests as needed by the business



Requirements



Essential{{:}}

2 years+ experience in a data analysis role in Procurement, Supply Chain, Manufacturing, or a related field
Proficiency in SQL
Proficiency in Excel including vlookups and pivot tables
Experience using data analysis tools such as Power BI or Tableau
Experience with data visualization and dashboard development
Strong analytical skills and ability to use data to inform decision-making
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
Proficient in spoken and written English
CV must be in English

Desirable{{:}}

Experience with JSON, XML, SOAP, REST technologies
Knowledge of data warehousing concepts and data model design
Experience with ERP and SaaS platforms (SAP, Oracle, Infor M3, Coupa)
Experience in a programming language such as Java, Python, C# or .NET
Experience in applied analytics and Machine learning/AI techniques
Certifications in data analysis, SQL, or related fields are a plus




You'll love this role if...

You're excited about the prospect of working with Supplier Data in the Procurement and Supply Chain domain
You're passionate about analyzing data and drawing insights that will impact business decisions
You enjoy solving problems and don't mind going through multiple iterations until you get the best solution possible
You thrive in a continuous learning environment and keep up to date with the latest trends in your field
You're excited about learning from multiple industries and practices as you work through different data domains




You may not like this role if...

You like working independently as much as possible and don't like deadlines - this role requires that you collaborate in cross-functional teams to deliver work across one or more projects to satisfy clients and stakeholders
You are not interested with interacting with business stakeholders - the ability to understand the business context is key to this role as you will not only need to navigate the data but also know how to prepare the data in such a way that can be used by the business for analysis and insight
You expect clear instructions to perform your role - as a data analyst, you may often need to perform your role with limited context and information, and you will need to be open to seeking this out and iterating through multiple solutions
You do not like going through the process of cleaning and transforming - data analysts know the reality of how much work needs to be put in to get data to a readily available state and you need to be ready to take on that challenge
You do not like debugging SQL queries or find the prospect of seeing large pieces of code scary - to be able to confidently triage, investigate, and resolve issues effectively, debugging is a core part in a data analyst's workstream.

If you have tangential experience with providers / understands claims, informatics, Tableau, Power BI, understanding data systems, MDM is aggregating data from multiple systems and setting the right governance and processes, logic of that is good great candidate.

The Senior Analyst, MDM will be a key member on the MDM team and will work to develop and maintain the match strategies using data from various data sources including but not limited to our Credentialing and Human Resource systems.

Be a voice and advocate to use data to improve the quality of our decision making.


What You'll Bring
