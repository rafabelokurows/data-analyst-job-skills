About Us

""LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

Review as a technical expert the implementations of multiple teams across domains, continuously improving the deliverables of your teams


What You'll Bring


Experience with digital tracking and tag management in a B2C environment
Extensive experience in quantitative analysis roles, ideally including having worked closely with product teams for at least 5 years.
Excellent technical skills applying expert level SQL and Python for both analysis and efficient manipulation of large data sets.

Allica is the UK’s fastest growing company - and the fastest-growing financial technology (fintech) firm ever. Our purpose is to help established SMEs, one of the last major underserved opportunities in fintech. Established SMEs are the backbone of local communities - representing over a third of our economy - yet have been largely neglected both by traditional high street banks and modern fintech providers




Role Description

Data is a key asset to Allica and is deeply embedded in all our teams and products. With data, we assist and work with Finance, Operations, Credit Risk, Product and management. This role will be for the Lending Tribe.




We are looking for ambitious and curious people who can help us understand our data better, contribute to facilitating the discussions between engineering and the data stakeholders and have an impact on the business by telling stories around the insights they generate.




You will be an integral part of the lending data squad, and the initial focus will be scaling up our ability to deliver analytics/insights that shape our understanding of the business and enhancing our foundations for automated reporting




Principal Accountabilities

Understand our products and processes through the data we have or collect
Work with the Lending Tribe and other stakeholders (Ops, risk, etc) to understand their data needs and provide solutions that address the core need (not just the immediate request)
Contribute meaningful insights from our data that proactively drive decisions and new lines of inquiry
Build visualizations and reports that enable the Lending business to service their ongoing data needs and measure KPIs
Develop data knowledge base (definitions, working rhythms etc.) within the team that enables us to become an information hub for the business




Personal Attributes & Experience

Previous experience working as a data analyst (in finance is desirable but not essential)

Create and apply best practices for PI in BlueBay, including optimising dashboard productivity, prioritising business demand, and where possible, achieving high levels of reuse with existing dashboards and business logic.
Organise training for colleagues, building up the knowledge across the firm to support the ultimate end objective of self-servicing.
Work closely with PI developers to improve the user experience.
Create new processes and automate existing manual processes in Python, and review Python development by business users as part of the EUSE (End User Software Engineering) process.

Thinks about improvements to existing processes/tasks, doesn’t just react to work coming into the team.


Nice-to-have


Experience in a buy-side business reporting or support type role, with a focus on fixed income, either directly for an asset manager (or similar) or through a software vendor.
This is a technical role, but for the level being hired exposure to business concepts is just as important as technical skills, though the candidate must be technically-minded and have an interest in the technologies used in the role.


What is in it for you?

We thrive on the challenge to be our best - progressive thinking to keep growing and working together to deliver trusted advice to help our clients thrive and communities prosper. We care about each other, reaching our potential, making a difference to our communities, and achieving success that is mutual.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We’re a company on a mission - We are a unique Canadian Fintech that is the one stop shop for all financial needs of the consumer - Save, Spend, Borrow, Invest, and Protect. Every single team member, from product & engineering to sales & marketing, finance, operations, and everything in between is obsessed with one thing; helping Canadians make better financial choices. And we’re pretty great at it, too. Via our digital application technology and our award-winning in-house brokerages, we help over 2M Canadians per month make a positive impact on their finances. We have many unique businesses - a mortgage brokerage, a life insurance brokerage, a home and auto insurance brokerage, a mortgage originations and servicing business, a Financial Services Marketplace and a content business across Ratehub and MoneySense. 365 days a year we deliver our users the best online mortgage experience, personalized Credit Card and Loans options, and cheaper auto & home insurance policies than they typically get from their existing financial adviser.

Changing how people make financial choices isn’t easy, though. We know that achieving our mission is full of challenges; challenges that can be complex and often unexpected, but that are always interesting, rewarding, and fun to solve as a team. This is where you come in. We are on the hunt for the right kind of people to join us and help lead us forward to continued growth.

We have a newly created Data Team that is capturing data, analyzing it, harvesting it, modeling it to provide meaningful insights to our Members and to our businesses. We’re looking for a top performing Data Analyst to join this team, which will be the backbone of all the businesses (based in downtown Toronto but also open to remote candidates)! Reporting to the Head of Data, the Data Analyst is a critical member of Ratehub’s team who will drive decision making across the company. You will work on high impact projects with business stakeholders and will need to use data to solve long-term and immediate business problems. The role will involve data analysis, modeling and insights development. The ideal candidate has strong communications skills, a passion for data, a background in quantitative analysis and an interest in personal finance. You will get the opportunity to work closely with the other analysts in the team as well as the business stakeholders to learn different parts of the business and provide valuable support with data reporting and analysis across various business units.

Your Responsibilities


Drive business strategy by engaging with key stakeholders to understand the business vision, requirements & priorities and help to translate this into actionable insights
Analyze data to drive meaningful insights on consumer behavior, consumer’s financial needs, attitudes, pricing, revenue management, modeling and AI
Model, build, and maintain scorecards for different parts of the business using our BI tool
Collaborate with the other analysts to support product, marketing, sales and finance teams with ad hoc analysis and reporting
Support in developing and maintaining our data model by understanding key data sources and relationships between them


Your Qualifications


1-2 years’ of relevant work experience at an internet / ecommerce company (including co-ops and internships) required
Post-secondary degree: We value intelligence over relevance, but a Bachelors in Computer Science would be looked upon favorably
High proficiency with SQL for data analysis
Some knowledge of BI & reporting tools e.g. Looker, Tableau, Sisense, QlikView
Knowledge of Python or R is considered an asset
Experience with a web analytics tool to support product and marketing analysis will be an asset
Exposure to cloud infrastructure such as AWS, Azure or GCP is nice to have


BEYOND THE TECHNICAL YOU ARE:


Strong Analytical Skills
Detail oriented: High standard of data quality and integrity
Resourceful: You don’t have all the answers, but you know how to get them
Strong problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities
Adaptable to a fast paced environment and able to pivot quickly to align with changing priorities


CULTURE FIT:


No Ego: No task is too big or small. You are never afraid to ask questions when you are trying to learn and understand things. You have no problem rolling up your sleeves and helping to execute when the team needs help. This humility extends to all aspects of your work and interaction with teammates
Player Coach: You mentor and teach as you execute. You model the behaviour you expect from your team. You don’t just tell others what to do, you know and show how to do it at a high standard
Growth mindset: You have a desire to always continue to grow and learn. This means a willingness to get outside your comfort zone and try new things because you view these as opportunities to gain skills and knowledge
Helping Hand: You always offer to help without having to be asked. You go the extra mile to help out regardless of your team and function
Get S##T Done: Your bias is towards action. This means pitching in and rallying to get things across the finish line. Rather than putting off work ask yourself what you can do today to move the needle on a project or goal
Digs Deep: You aren't afraid to ask questions because you want to understand every issue so that you can properly solve the root cause of the problem instead of just completing the task you are given


JOB PERKS:


Competitive salary: We know life is expensive
Flexible hours: Enjoy a couple more hours of sleep in the morning, if you want
Benefits: Health is wealth! A benefits package with no employee contribution required
Perks: RRSP matching program, individual training allowance, access to financial literacy training and resources
Casual dress code: If it’s good enough for you, it’s good enough for us
Fun team socials


Ratehub welcomes and encourages applications from people with disabilities. Accommodations are available upon request for candidates taking part in all aspects of the selection process.

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

A day in the life of a Capital One Data Analyst.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making. As a Data Analyst at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and agony in their financial lives.

Responsibilities:


Writing SQL to clean, transform, investigate data.

Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in un-mined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.
