We’re building the next generation of recruiting software and we’re starting with a suite of products that helps talent leaders, recruiters, and hiring managers run an efficient and data-driven hiring process.

We are well-funded and backed by great investors, including Y Combinator, Elad Gil and Lachy Groom. We have over 1,500 amazing customers including Ramp, Notion, OpenAI and Zapier – yet we've only taken the first steps toward a much larger opportunity. In short, it's the perfect time to join! 🚀

About This Role

👋 Hi, I’m Kevin, I manage the data team and analytics products at Ashby. With Ashby’s ongoing growth we’re entering a new phase where the role of data will become more important than ever before. With that in mind, I’m looking for a talented data analyst to join our dynamic team!

As a data analyst at Ashby you’ll primarily be focused on product-related analytical questions. This will cover the gamut of most standard analyses and related assets (analysis summaries, metric monitoring, dashboards, etc). Given Ashby is well-positioned to capture global recruiting data, our product analyses naturally lend themselves to global job market benchmark reports which are highly valuable to Ashby and the broader employer and candidate job markets (see our Talent Trends for some examples).

Your responsibilities will cover the whole data funnel: starting from raw or lightly modeled data all the way through final analysis summary. When appropriate, you will be responsible for analysis work that become standardized internal dashboards for other Ashby team members. All in, you will have broad analytical ownership and responsibilities, so this is a role best fit for a curious and ambitious type that enjoys touching the whole data analysis ecosystem.

If you are a product-minded analyst, given Ashby supports a whole recruiting analytics product line there is a very real potential that your internal analysis work could contribute directly to our product. This is not a requirement, but I see it as a genuinely likely possibility and an added bonus.

Data Culture at Ashby

At Ashby, we draw a clear distinction between when to look to data for ""the answer"" and when to use data to aid principled thinking for decision making. In general, a primary consideration is whether or not data is needed to help clarify points of uncertainty. When data is considered necessary, a secondary consideration is to what depth data will be required. Data questions lend themselves to ongoing what about... or what if... explorations, which can be important in some situations but are not always necessary. With these dynamics in mind, we do not foster an environment where every decision we make should be backed by data, but we do foster an environment where teammates ask whether or not data will fit the task at hand well. This, in turn, allows us to operate a lean team focused on projects where data provides true leverage to our overall business and product goals.

As a related but distinct point, Ashby’s data culture as far as transparency and access goes is very open. We share company-wide access to our financial standings, progress, and goals and generally make any data and reporting we do consider valuable broadly available. Outside of constraints related to whether a teammate has access to a particular tool, there are close to no constraints on access the state of the company as told by data or reporting. In general, we would like to continue and extend open access to data throughout the company (with your help!), but with consideration and not as a substitute for principled thinking :)

Requirements

The essence of this role dictates you must be analytical, conversant in statistical reasoning, capable of managing the data you work with and distilling results into the appropriate downstream assets. There are a lot of ways to meet those responsibilities. If the dot product of your skill vector with this requirements vector is close to 1, please consider applying, but please note it does not have to be 1.0.


Expertise in SQL-based data analysis
Strong in analytical and statistical thinking - you must be able to generate insights
Expertise with data visualization (i.e. visual communication of results)
Proficiency in Python (primarily in the domain of data analysis and visualization)
Interest in working directly with business partners, e.g. product or go-to-market teammates, to identify and plan related analysis efforts
Proficiency building internal “data products” based on your analysis results, e.g. high-usage dashboards via BI tools (Looker, Tableau, etc) for various business partners
Excellent written and verbal communication. Ashby has a writing-centric culture, but you will also be responsible for direct collaboration with various teammates
Very detail-oriented: in your analysis work you can anticipate complications and identify bad-but-not-obviously-wrong data discrepancies
Experience modeling and working with product analytics events


You could be a great fit if


You identify as exceptionally curious by nature
You could pass as an “analytics engineer” or have working proficiency in dbt-based data modeling
You have been a first or early data analyst at a growing, fast-moving startup
You have working experience in B2B SaaS and understand how analysis facilitates business success
You have an intuition for solving problems pragmatically and an eye for leverage
You enjoy collaboration and find reward in enabling other teammates to succeed
You have strong, experience-backed opinions about data products and data culture in a company setting
Familiarity with our data stack is a bonus, but not a requirement
Have a passion for refining the role of data within company environments, spanning everything from communication standards and data request management - you’ll help shape this as Ashby grows
You can appreciate the whole distribution as much as a point estimator


Reasons not to apply


You do not enjoy working directly with analysts or other business stakeholders. This role will require working closely and in earnest with teammates across the company as various data-related needs come up.
You are looking for consumer-scale data infrastructure projects. We have a huge and interesting set of data to work with (check out our data trends reports!), but we are a B2B SaaS company. Relative to B2C services, we might best be considered small but mighty :)
You are seeking an in-person work experience. Although there are hot spots of Ashby employees around the world, Ashby is a remote workplace. Rest assured, we do meet up in person for various events throughout the year!
You want to be on a large team of analysts. The data team at Ashby is lean, so you will be primarily working with a data engineering partner and your manager (me!). That said, you will be working directly with many team members across the company, so your teammates in the analysis sense will be the diversity of folks you collaborate with on analysis to analysis.


Ashby's Data Stack

As it will undoubtedly be a point of interest, a quick summary of our data stack is provided here. Our production database is postgres, which we integrate into a Snowflake data warehouse via a custom data pipeline. All other business systems are integrated via Fivetran. We use Prefect for orchestration and dbt for data modeling. Frontend event tracking is done via Rudderstack. Data visualization and reporting varies, but the broader company is primarily served standardized analytics via Looker. For version control we use Git/Github (and Github Actions for CI/CD). As an Analyst, you'll be at liberty to work in a notebook or tool of your choice. Internal documentation lives in Slab.

Interview Process

Our interview process is thorough — we aim to ensure each person that joins the team is the right fit for Ashby and will provide ample information for you to assess if Ashby is the right fit for you. The process for this role is as follows:


Hiring Manager Screen - 30 to 45 min
Take home mini-analysis & review
Final Round - about 2.5 to 3 hours (can do multi-day)


Note: please do not reach out to the broader Ashby team requesting more information or time to connect. We will diligently review all applications in detail after the public posting period is over.

Benefits


Competitive salary and equity.
10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.
Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it 😅.
Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.
Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!
$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.
If you’re in the US, top-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us.


Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.

If you've made it this far and are excited about Ashby, please apply and follow us on LinkedIn to stay up to date!

Compensation Range: $120K - $150K

Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It’s where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you’ll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You’ll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Creating a life you love also means finding a career that celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences that you bring. As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

The mission of the Business Operations team is to assess how well Pinterest’s strategy is delivering enterprise performance and influence exec-level decisions to evolve strategy and operations accordingly. As the Lead Data Analyst (Trust & Safety), you will shape and deliver on the analytical agenda that provides critical business insights for our Exec Team while partnering with Product, Engineering, Data Science, and others to improve how we execute. With a combination of exceptional analytical skills, insatiable curiosity, and strong partnering skills, you’ll help us better understand how to keep Pinterest a safe, inspiring platform and drive changes that shape its future.

What You’ll Do


Business Analytics & Reporting. Develop a deep understanding of the Trust & Safety challenges and roadmap and how they drive our business / user experience to inform important decisions and priorities across the organization. Define critical KPIs and build core operating dashboards to help teams drive operational rigor and manage performance. Be the primary point person with our senior leadership on understanding metrics movements and trends in our business.
Strategy & Special Projects. Tackle key strategic questions and critical business initiatives, and partner with leaders throughout Pinterest to build business cases for potential investments. Present insights and recommendations to senior leadership, and drive the “follow through” of those recommendations to ensure smooth execution with a diverse array of cross-functional partners.
Planning & Forecasting. Manage the forecast models for core topline metrics that drive company-wide forecasting, goal-setting, and strategic planning. Work with senior leaders to update their strategic priorities and goals on a regular basis.



What We’re Looking For


Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as economics, business administration, or data analytics or equivalent experience. MBA optional
7+ years of experience in analytical or strategic roles with at least 2 years in Trust & Safety. You’ve been a top performer in an analytical role and have a strong background in and passion for Trust & Safety.
Exceptional data analysis skills. You’re a true expert in a variety of analytical tools, including SQL, Tableau, and Excel (and in areas you’re not, you have the growth mindset to learn it); knowledge of Python and R is a plus.
Entrepreneurial self-starter. You thrive in a fast-moving, ambiguous environment, and are independently capable of seeking information, corralling resources, and delivering results without waiting for direction.
Strong communication skills. You can move seamlessly between conversing with engineers or frontline ops employees and leading presentations with senior executives.
High-energy, positive team player. You have a proven ability to build strong working relationships with business partners; this is a highly cross-functional role, so a low ego and a high instinct for collaboration are musts.
Keen aptitude to scale the team. Help build out processes for a small (but mighty) team. Help build our influence across the organization to tackle each of the above for your coverage area.



Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement


We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.

At Pinterest we believe the workplace should be equitable, inclusive, and inspiring for every employee.
