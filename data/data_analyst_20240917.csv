About Us

""LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

Above and beyond discrimination/harassment based on “protected categories,” Bitly also strives to prevent other, subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (e.g., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at Bitly.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques.

We are looking for a Data Analyst that is passionate about metrics and telling the stories behind the data. We have several roles open across different teams (grocery, loyalty, restaurants). Data Analysts at Deliveroo report into our data science management team.

You will be a professional in insights storytelling, communication and visualisation and know how to create action from metrics. Crafting effective intelligent benchmarks, understanding performance, caring about data quality, enabling automation and creating phenomenal visualisations and stories are things that drive you.

What you'll be doing



Work closely with commercial stakeholders to create value and business impact through better data availability, visualisation and analysis
Discover, analyse, and interpret trends or patterns in complex datasets to perform ad-hoc analyses and deliver insights to the executive team and senior management
Understand key drivers of the business and provide data driven guidance on key levers
Identify and specify data needs and quality requirements and work closely with Analytics Engineers to ensure data is available, accurate and corresponds to the business needs
Consolidate and distribute best analytical practices from different teams and countries



Requirements



Experience identifying the root cause of problems, assessing risks/impacts and determining and implementing effective solutions.
A good understanding of querying in SQL and understanding of database structure - you'll be expected to be able to extract the data you need for your analysis.
Compelling story-telling skills, and an eye for powerful visualisations - you'll need to translate your findings for all levels of stakeholder (business and technical)
Good knowledge of Excel/GSheets - depending on the task, there is a good chance that this is where some of your exploratory analysis will take place. Being comfortable with pivot tables and functions will be essential.
Developer experience with a data visualisation tool (Looker, Tableau, Periscope)

As a Lead Data Analyst, Operations, you will be at the forefront of transforming how our delivery and warehouse operations function. In this role, you’ll dive deep into the heart of our supply chain, logistics, and warehouse management to uncover insights that will streamline processes and improve efficiency.

Our operations span multiple warehouses and delivery points, facing the daily challenges of managing fluctuating demand, optimizing delivery routes, reducing waste, and ensuring timely fulfillment. This is an opportunity for a highly analytical individual who is excited by solving tough operational problems and who thrives in fast-paced, dynamic environments.

You Will:


Drive Operational Efficiency: Analyse and enhance key metrics related to delivery times, warehouse capacity, order fulfilment, and logistics operations. Your insights will directly impact how we optimise our delivery operations to reduce delays, improve cost-efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.
Deep Dive into Warehouse Operations: Work closely with our operations team to ensure our warehouse functions are aligned with overall business goals. You'll investigate key areas such as stock inbounding and storage optimisation.
Data at the Core: Build and maintain advanced data models that provide clarity and insight into complex operational challenges. You’ll be a key player in ensuring that data is accessible and actionable to drive day-to-day decision-making across our logistics and delivery network.
Collaborate with Stakeholders: Partner with regional managers, store general managers, delivery operations leads, and the customer service team to translate data into strategic recommendations. You'll ensure that data insights are not only clear but actionable for those on the ground.
Tackle Real-World Challenges: From last-mile delivery hurdles to warehouse bottlenecks, this role requires someone who can navigate ambiguity and provide practical, data-driven solutions. This is not a role for someone who wants to stay behind the scenes; we need a hands-on analyst who can get into the details of operations and drive tangible improvements.


You Have:

At Gaia, we're on a mission to make IVF more accessible for more people. With a better way to pay for treatment, a backup plan if it doesn't work, one-on-one support along the way, and access to a community that just gets it, we're here to offer the IVF experience we wish we'd had. We believe that everyone who wants a family should have the chance to try.

Gaia is a revolutionary way to manage the financial toll and risk associated with fertility treatments. Members begin a new cycle for as little as an upfront protection fee, and only pay for their treatment when they have a child — nothing if they don't. Each plan is personalized and underpinned by a proprietary clinical model predicting treatment outcomes. Launched in 2022 in the UK, Gaia has been recognized in Bloomberg, Wired, and FastCo.

Our Company Values

Because we're building in an extraordinarily complex space, we need to be unapologetically demanding and single-minded in the pursuit of our goals, while going out of our way to support people. Four values drive everything we do at Gaia:

Them, not you: Do right by our members, be kind, and take one for the team.

Drive or get out of the way: Identify problems, take initiative, and step out of your lane.

When in doubt, be brave: It's the only way to bring about change.

Be extraordinary at what you do: Pursue your craft with excellence and seriousness.

The role

As our dedicated data analyst, you will be responsible for the delivery and usage of the data pipeline. You will have ownership around how the data is modelled and how much value it delivers in the company will ultimately depend on you.

You will work closely with engineering and team leads to both excel at data modelling but also provide and support data insights across the company. Your ultimate expertise will help Gaia take better, faster decisions.

What you will own

You will own and work on Gaia's data analytics pipeline:


Working with the engineering and product teams to make sure your data requirements are taken into account before any development work happens
Working with the engineering team to ingest the data and think through how to best model it to a consumable, sensible format and surface it in our BI
Maintaining the data pipeline - with the relevant monitoring in place to ensure it runs smoothly, daily. This includes testing the data and monitoring these tests. You will also work closely with our data engineer to implement new solutions or updates to our current stack.
Work with our data engineer to support specific data flows built around the data warehouse (reverse ETL to our CRM, Ads platforms, ingesting custom data…)


Our stack: dbt + Fivetran + Prefect + Snowflake + Omni

You will also work closely with the rest of the company to:


Ensure the relevant data is shown in the self-serve BI. You will work with different team leaders to deeply understand their areas of focus and ensure the right data is properly modelled & documented so that they can make the most of it to inform their decisions
Ensure teams across Gaia are trained and capable in getting the most out of the BI. This includes developing best practices and tips on how to use Omni, sharing good visualisation techniques, and being a thought-partner on measuring the performance of a product release.


You'll be a great candidate if


You have worked in the past in a similar role within a data team and are fully comfortable around Github and collaborating around dbt. As such you have good experience writing any variant of SQL.
You are comfortable with Python in the context of data modelling.
You've got experience working both with software engineers and business owners ; being able to adapt in how you discuss your work. You understand the trade-offs that engineers might face when architecting the data you consume and you are able to match your needs with their requirements.
You are data-curious: you will help us refine how we model our data to best answer questions and won't hesitate to challenge business decisions with relevant insights.
You know how to balance speed and thoroughness: you like going down data rabbit holes to deeply understand a problem and help answer difficult question, but you are also comfortable with quickly getting to a first answer without iterating too many times.

Gaia counts 38 employees spanning 10+ different nationalities. Gaia's board of directors is composed of founder Nader AlSalim and 2 women — from Kindred Capital and Leila Zegna from KindredCapital and Terese Hougaard. Women are also well represented at the company's C-suite level (COO, CMO, Chief of Staff) and within Gaia's data and engineering team, a traditionally male dominated field.

The role

We are looking for a talented Data Analyst as we look to establish our Data and Insights function. The role will include hands-on and strategic components, and you'll work closely with our tech and growth teams to drive business decisions. You'll have ownership across external and internal reporting initiatives, and will be motivated to bring structure and scalability to our database and reporting workstreams.

The ideal candidate for this role will be highly analytical and passionate about how data is collected and utilised, as well as able to build great relationships across many parts of an organisation and build rapport with our partner stakeholders. In particular, we're looking for someone who can understand the breadth of complex data both internally and externally to inform strategic and tactical decisions.

Who We Are

We are a growing team dedicated to improving healthcare. We are ambitious, customer focused, and driven by the impact we are having in healthcare. We're also a VC backed startup, which brings agility and growth opportunities unlike anywhere else.

Since going live in our first pilot sites just over 3 years ago, Isla has scaled quickly and is now working with 30+ Trusts across the NHS. Isla is an intuitive and highly scalable solution which can be deployed across multiple specialties and can support patients right across their healthcare journey.

What Is Isla

Isla enables healthcare systems to deliver next level healthcare, meeting the challenges of global increase in demand for services through an efficient new model and technology platform. We provide clinicians with the platform they need to receive a continuous flow of clinical information from patients and create an always up to date understanding of a person's health.

This provides valuable clinical context for decision-making whilst delivering convenient care for patients, empowering clinical teams to deliver responsive care with fewer appointments. The Isla platform is intuitive, endlessly scalable, and approved by NHS Digital as a cloud storage solution.

Over the next 12 months you will:


Work closely with our tech teams on analytics and metrics for product decision-making, both in inputs to experiments or feature development and through monitoring uptake and benefit of changes
Own our reporting workstreams and database health
Understand client reporting needs to track intervention/pathway success for every day users to monitor their activity, and to support buyers and key decision makers

Strong analytical skills

Excellent communication and presentation skills
Enthusiasm, passion, energy and the desire to make positive change



Nice to have, but not essential:


Working knowledge of Google Analytics
Experience in python
Experience in B2B analytics

What is the hiring process for this role at Isla?

Interviewing with us for the Data Analyst role will be split into 4 stages (all conducted virtually):

1️⃣ A screening interview with our Director of Operations - 20 minutes

2️⃣ A practical task you will complete independently

3️⃣ A one to one interview with our Director of Product - 30 minutes

4️⃣ A final interview with one of our Co-founders - 30 minutes

Diversity and Inclusion

Isla is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to building an inclusive and diverse team. We encourage all qualified candidates to apply. Isla does not discriminate against anyone on the basis of their race, gender, disability, religion, national origin, age, or any other protected category. We choose to celebrate our team's differences and see them as one of our most valuable assets.

Recruitment is not one-size-fits-all and we're happy to tailor our hiring process to better meet the needs of individual applicants. Please email recruitment@isla.health with any requests for support.

Using AI tools for your application

Most of our roles include several questions as part of the application process. AI tools such as ChatGPT might be useful in structuring or proof-reading your cover letter or your application answers. We encourage you to do your own research though to fully understand the company and the role you are applying to as you will be asked questions during any interview. Generic AI-generated answers are also really obvious. We'd like to get an idea of how you think early in the process; you should also make sure Isla is the right fit for you before you apply. Make AI tools work for you, not against you!

Our platform empowers millions of buyers and sellers in more than 190 markets around the world. We’re committed to pushing boundaries and leaving our mark as we reinvent the future of ecommerce for enthusiasts.

Our customers are our compass, authenticity thrives, bold ideas are welcome, and everyone can bring their unique selves to work — every day. We're in this together, sustaining the future of our customers, our company, and our planet.

Join a team of passionate thinkers, innovators, and dreamers — and help us connect people and build communities to create economic opportunity for all.

About The Opportunity

eBay Motors is a multi-billion dollar, global portfolio comprising the Parts & Accessories, Business & Industrial, Vehicles, and WHI (a B2B Parts & Accessories marketplace in US) businesses. These categories are not only among the largest on eBay and core to eBay’s strategic future, but also are actively innovating in the market and at eBay!

We are looking to hire an expert analyst, who will support the eBay UK’s Parts & Accessories leadership team and play an instrumental role in accelerating growth for P&A’s UK business. The role will utilise data and business case development to develop strategic insights, while ensuring operational excellence in planning, analytics, reporting, and teamwork across a broad cross-functional team. Our key partners include product, marketing, analytics, finance, operations, monetization, and business development, among many others.

The role demands a dual mentality: both that of a strategic leader—who has a deep understanding of the dynamics of two-sided marketplaces, can break down tough problems into clear frameworks, operate in ambiguity, and possesses strong data intuition—as well as someone who can move quickly and decisively as an embedded operator not afraid to get their hands dirty.

What you will accomplish


Serve as an analytics partner to the UK Parts & Accessories leadership team
Apply strategic, operational, and analytical standard methodologies to extract and present actionable insights on what’s driving business performance

Identify and execute against opportunities across the Parts & Accessories landscape that require strategic deep dives
Partner with Category Managers, partners, and sellers to drive key initiatives



What You Will Bring


Strategic problem solver with strong analytical/data science skills to dive into data and identity root causes
High degree of ownership and commitment to results
Self-motivated to find opportunities and challenges in the business
Communicates clearly, effectively, and proactively with strong listening, written, and verbal communication skills
Ambition to grow professionally and willingness to work hard, learn/adapt, and provide feedback both upward and to peer teams



Requirements


2+ years of related experience, ideally at a top-tier management consulting firm, investment bank, or in a strategy & planning role at a major corporation
Excellent analytical skills including familiarity with SQL
Interest and/or experience in Motors a plus, but not required
Knowledge of ecommerce and market landscape

After receiving significant investment, they are growing their data management function as they look to realise their ambition of building a market leading platform.

This Business Data Analyst position is part of a growing delivery team that owns the development and improvement of core data workflows. Working in a matrix environment with talented teams in Data, Technology and Product, you’ll act as the connection point between end users and the data team, building an understanding of the as is and to be business processes.

A fantastic opportunity for someone to further develop their analysis skills, this role would suit someone moving from a data operations position or someone that has already established themselves as a Business/Data Analyst.

Our client’s working arrangements require three days per week in the office in London as a minimum. This is a deliberate and thoughtful choice that is aligned with an emphasis on collaboration between the product and data teams and the user community.

About The Company

This Fintech business has demonstrated an admirable track record of adapting to meet the needs of its customers, evolving its product portfolio and establishing itself as one of the leaders in the provision of insight products and services to the financial sector.

Through adopting a customer centric approach they have been able to demonstrate impressive growth domestically and internationally. It is the breadth of services, combined with investment in technology, and crucially the people that deliver it, that has seen the business go from strength to strength.

About The Opportunity

Working directly for the Head of Data, in a team that is set to grow significantly over coming months, your key focus will be on supporting the backlog of data management tasks undertaken by the Product Owners.

Using your eye for detail you’ll create accurate documentation that details the current state of core data systems, applications and workflows before working with Product Owners and stakeholders to document the target state.

You’ll use your inquisitive nature to ask questions of your users, helping you to understand the business needs that would drive new developments and enhancements to the core systems. Drafting requirements and preparing user stories, you’ll be building on the core skills that could ultimately support a move into product management.

An agile environment, this role will have you playing an active part in Scrum ceremonies, backlog refinement and preparation sessions. You’ll also use your data analysis skills to support decision making on what tasks to prioritise and why.

Bringing a quality focus to this position you’ll be involved in the testing process, from planning and executing User Acceptance Test scenarios and scripts as required.

Acting as the bridge between stakeholders and the engineering team, you’ll ensure that requirements are understood and met throughout the development process.

About You

A strong Data or Business Analyst, you’ll evidence the ability to blend core business analysis skills with an excellent grasp of data management and processing, using these skills to improve data workflows across the business.

In Addition, You’ll Demonstrate The Following


Experience working either in a data product business or in a data team that has been responsible for working with large scale data challenges. Time spent working in a Fintech environment is particularly helpful but not essential.
Ability to create data documents and artefacts.
Experience of working in an Agile environment and in partnership with Product Owners.
Strong data analysis skills using tools such as SQL and Power BI.
Exceptional communication skills that support your engagement with team members and stakeholders.
Confidence in visualising data and communicating your analysis of that data.

PI is an internally developed application providing reporting on BlueBay’s Data Warehouse.


Help users with complicated PI questions.
Create and apply best practices for PI in BlueBay, including optimising dashboard productivity, prioritising business demand, and where possible, achieving high levels of reuse with existing dashboards and business logic.
Organise training for colleagues, building up the knowledge across the firm to support the ultimate end objective of self-servicing.
Work closely with PI developers to improve the user experience.
Create new processes and automate existing manual processes in Python, and review Python development by business users as part of the EUSE (End User Software Engineering) process.
Writing database queries, including metadata queries against PI, and historical data requests against BlueBay’s legacy databases.
Establish best practices for Tableau and help ensure they are followed. Act as the business owner for the Tableau environment.
Deliver, on a timely basis, high-quality Tableau dashboards for users throughout the firm, built using best practice principals and developed within the agreed boundaries of the Tableau governance framework.

Thinks about improvements to existing processes/tasks, doesn’t just react to work coming into the team.


Nice-to-have


Experience in a buy-side business reporting or support type role, with a focus on fixed income, either directly for an asset manager (or similar) or through a software vendor.
This is a technical role, but for the level being hired exposure to business concepts is just as important as technical skills, though the candidate must be technically-minded and have an interest in the technologies used in the role.


What is in it for you?

We thrive on the challenge to be our best - progressive thinking to keep growing and working together to deliver trusted advice to help our clients thrive and communities prosper. We care about each other, reaching our potential, making a difference to our communities, and achieving success that is mutual.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

This is where you come in. We are on the hunt for the right kind of people to join us and help lead us forward to continued growth.

You have no problem rolling up your sleeves and helping to execute when the team needs help. This humility extends to all aspects of your work and interaction with teammates
Player Coach: You mentor and teach as you execute. You model the behaviour you expect from your team. You don’t just tell others what to do, you know and show how to do it at a high standard
Growth mindset: You have a desire to always continue to grow and learn. This means a willingness to get outside your comfort zone and try new things because you view these as opportunities to gain skills and knowledge
Helping Hand: You always offer to help without having to be asked. You go the extra mile to help out regardless of your team and function
Get S##T Done: Your bias is towards action. This means pitching in and rallying to get things across the finish line. Rather than putting off work ask yourself what you can do today to move the needle on a project or goal
Digs Deep: You aren't afraid to ask questions because you want to understand every issue so that you can properly solve the root cause of the problem instead of just completing the task you are given


JOB PERKS:


Competitive salary: We know life is expensive
Flexible hours: Enjoy a couple more hours of sleep in the morning, if you want
Benefits: Health is wealth! A benefits package with no employee contribution required
Perks: RRSP matching program, individual training allowance, access to financial literacy training and resources
Casual dress code: If it’s good enough for you, it’s good enough for us
Fun team socials

A day in the life of a Capital One Data Analyst.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making. As a Data Analyst at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and agony in their financial lives.

Responsibilities:


Writing SQL to clean, transform, investigate data.
Working closely with business partners to harness the power of data in compliance testing.
Designing rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas.

Supporting and consulting with the business to propagate data management best practices.

Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in un-mined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.

Will obtain or have obtained a Bachelor’s degree or higher and graduating in 2024-2025

Each week, month and quarter will require you to build on what you've learned previously as we’re learning, iterating and making big steps towards our vision of executing our 2030 Strategy.

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We’re a company on a mission - We are a unique Canadian Fintech that is the one stop shop for all financial needs of the consumer - Save, Spend, Borrow, Invest, and Protect. Every single team member, from product & engineering to sales & marketing, finance, operations, and everything in between is obsessed with one thing; helping Canadians make better financial choices. And we’re pretty great at it, too. Via our digital application technology and our award-winning in-house brokerages, we help over 2M Canadians per month make a positive impact on their finances. We have many unique businesses - a mortgage brokerage, a life insurance brokerage, a home and auto insurance brokerage, a mortgage originations and servicing business, a Financial Services Marketplace and a content business across Ratehub and MoneySense. 365 days a year we deliver our users the best online mortgage experience, personalized Credit Card and Loans options, and cheaper auto & home insurance policies than they typically get from their existing financial adviser.

Changing how people make financial choices isn’t easy, though. We know that achieving our mission is full of challenges; challenges that can be complex and often unexpected, but that are always interesting, rewarding, and fun to solve as a team. This is where you come in. We are on the hunt for the right kind of people to join us and help lead us forward to continued growth.

We have a newly created Data Team that is capturing data, analyzing it, harvesting it, modeling it to provide meaningful insights to our Members and to our businesses. We’re looking for a top performing Data Analyst to join this team, which will be the backbone of all the businesses (based in downtown Toronto but also open to remote candidates)! Reporting to the Head of Data, the Data Analyst is a critical member of Ratehub’s team who will drive decision making across the company. You will work on high impact projects with business stakeholders and will need to use data to solve long-term and immediate business problems. The role will involve data analysis, modeling and insights development. The ideal candidate has strong communications skills, a passion for data, a background in quantitative analysis and an interest in personal finance. You will get the opportunity to work closely with the other analysts in the team as well as the business stakeholders to learn different parts of the business and provide valuable support with data reporting and analysis across various business units.

Your Responsibilities


Drive business strategy by engaging with key stakeholders to understand the business vision, requirements & priorities and help to translate this into actionable insights
Analyze data to drive meaningful insights on consumer behavior, consumer’s financial needs, attitudes, pricing, revenue management, modeling and AI
Model, build, and maintain scorecards for different parts of the business using our BI tool
Collaborate with the other analysts to support product, marketing, sales and finance teams with ad hoc analysis and reporting
Support in developing and maintaining our data model by understanding key data sources and relationships between them


Your Qualifications


1-2 years’ of relevant work experience at an internet / ecommerce company (including co-ops and internships) required
Post-secondary degree: We value intelligence over relevance, but a Bachelors in Computer Science would be looked upon favorably
High proficiency with SQL for data analysis
Some knowledge of BI & reporting tools e.g. Looker, Tableau, Sisense, QlikView
Knowledge of Python or R is considered an asset
Experience with a web analytics tool to support product and marketing analysis will be an asset
Exposure to cloud infrastructure such as AWS, Azure or GCP is nice to have


BEYOND THE TECHNICAL YOU ARE:


Strong Analytical Skills
Detail oriented: High standard of data quality and integrity
Resourceful: You don’t have all the answers, but you know how to get them
Strong problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities
Adaptable to a fast paced environment and able to pivot quickly to align with changing priorities


CULTURE FIT:


No Ego: No task is too big or small. You are never afraid to ask questions when you are trying to learn and understand things. You have no problem rolling up your sleeves and helping to execute when the team needs help. This humility extends to all aspects of your work and interaction with teammates
Player Coach: You mentor and teach as you execute. You model the behaviour you expect from your team. You don’t just tell others what to do, you know and show how to do it at a high standard
Growth mindset: You have a desire to always continue to grow and learn. This means a willingness to get outside your comfort zone and try new things because you view these as opportunities to gain skills and knowledge
Helping Hand: You always offer to help without having to be asked. You go the extra mile to help out regardless of your team and function
Get S##T Done: Your bias is towards action. This means pitching in and rallying to get things across the finish line. Rather than putting off work ask yourself what you can do today to move the needle on a project or goal
Digs Deep: You aren't afraid to ask questions because you want to understand every issue so that you can properly solve the root cause of the problem instead of just completing the task you are given


JOB PERKS:


Competitive salary: We know life is expensive
Flexible hours: Enjoy a couple more hours of sleep in the morning, if you want
Benefits: Health is wealth! A benefits package with no employee contribution required
Perks: RRSP matching program, individual training allowance, access to financial literacy training and resources
Casual dress code: If it’s good enough for you, it’s good enough for us
Fun team socials


Ratehub welcomes and encourages applications from people with disabilities. Accommodations are available upon request for candidates taking part in all aspects of the selection process.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our GTM (Go-To-Market) Analytics team is on the mission to maximize revenue by providing actionable insights and reporting to our partners across Sales, Marketing, and Growth. GTM Analytics is situated within the broader Data Science organization at Stripe, which is home to a diverse team of data analysts and scientists, product managers, and engineers that span their focus across sales, marketing, and product-led growth. GTM Analytics leverages sales, marketing, and product data to build and provide a wide variety of tools that are utilized across the company to drive business decisions.

What you’ll do

As a senior member of the GTM Analytics team, you will lead analytical projects that shed light on our self-service business. You will increase our understanding of growth drivers and influence business outcomes by recommending solutions rooted in analyses and your deep understanding of Stripe’s users. You will partner closely with cross-functional Growth pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts and scientists that obsess over the experience Stripe users have on their journey to become customers – from initial signup through onboarding and retention.

Responsibilities


Collaborate with Growth stakeholders to ideate, scope, and develop data products that shed light on Stripe’s self-service business.
Influence Stripe’s Growth roadmap by proactively identifying opportunities and emerging trends in Stripe’s Growth business in ongoing forums.
Develop frameworks that allow for analysis at scale across Stripe’s self-service experience.
Build and maintain data pipelines and dashboards that provide consistent and timely data and insights.
Work with finance partners on forecasting and planning models that provide visibility into the future of Stripe’s self-service business.
Define key Growth metrics, gain consensus around their definitions, and drive adoption of their usage.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


8+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Expertise in data storytelling and visualization, using data-driven insights to deliver actionable recommendations and drive business goals
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $179,000 - $268,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Awesome. Something led you here, maybe a glimpse of potential and something amazing? Well that’s how we feel about Klue.

Who are we?

Klue is a VC backed, capital-efficient high growth SaaS company. Tiger Global and Salesforce Ventures led our US$62m Series B in the fall of 2021. We’re creating the category of competitive enablement: helping companies understand their market and outmaneuver their competition. We benefit from having an experienced leadership team working alongside several hundred risk-taking builders who elevate every day.

We’re one of Canada’s Most Admired Corporate Cultures by Waterstone HC, a Deloitte Technology Fast 50 & Fast 500 winner, and recipient of both the Startup of the Year and Tech Culture of the Year awards at the Technology Impact Awards.

The Data Insights' team scope covers data validation for existing sources, outsourced content, and new potential data sources. This role is focused on quality checks at scale and you will be key in ensuring that our data providers and outsourced content creators are delivering high-quality content that is linked back to source data. As the data marketplace is always evolving, you will also be involved in POC's of new data sources that can support manual curation initiatives.

This is You:


Highly analytical and critical thinker
Ability to digest and communicate complex data
You like ambiguity and thrive in fast-paced environments
Your Excel and/or Python skills are top notch
Strong communicator and natural networker
You like to learn new things and are keen to become an expert


Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:
