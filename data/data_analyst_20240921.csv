Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

T&C is a family-owned company that builds authentic relationships one interaction at a time through consistent commitment to heartfelt service, relating to people as people (not numbers) and by selling the freshest, highest-quality products available. We have a deep passion for food and people and are always looking for service-minded individuals of all backgrounds to join our community.

Who You Are

You are genuine and authentic in your interactions both with your customers and co-workers. You thrive in a team environment, take your responsibilities seriously, and always consider the customer in your decisions. You see richness and strength in a diverse workforce and treat others with respect to create a place of belonging for all. You care about your community and the environment. Pursuing knowledge in order to add value and grow is your idea of fun. Oh, and you love food!

WHAT WE OFFER (IN ADDITION TO BEING A FUN PLACE TO WORK)

We have a highly competitive benefits package ($5-$19 weekly medical premiums), vacation/sick time, paid holidays, premium pay rates, an Employee Assistance Program, a discount on virtually everything in our markets, 401(k) plans, profit-sharing and a pension, scholarship program and an employee referral bonus program. Whoa! That’s a lot of great stuff!

THE SMALL PRINT WE WANT YOU TO BE AWARE OF

T&C is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. We value a diverse workplace and do not discriminate based on race, color, national origin, religion, caste, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other applicable characteristic protected by law. We invite women, people of color, LGBTQ individuals, members of ethnic minorities, foreign-born residents, and veterans to apply. Duties and responsibilities may be added, deleted, or changed at any time at the discretion of management, formally or informally, either verbally or in writing.

If your experience looks a little different from what we’ve identified and you think you can thrive in this role, we’d love to learn more about you. Research shows that women and members of other under-represented groups tend to not apply to jobs when they think they may not meet every qualification, when, in fact, they often do! We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment and strongly encourage you to apply.

AWS Infrastructure Services owns the design, planning, delivery, and operation of all AWS global infrastructure. In other words, we’re the people who keep the cloud running. We support all AWS data centers and all of the servers, storage, networking, power, and cooling equipment that ensure our customers have continual access to the innovation they rely on. We work on the most challenging problems, with thousands of variables impacting the supply chain — and we’re looking for talented people who want to help.

You’ll join a diverse team of software, hardware, and network engineers, supply chain specialists, security experts, operations managers, and other vital roles. You’ll collaborate with people across AWS to help us deliver the highest standards for safety and security while providing seemingly infinite capacity at the lowest possible cost for our customers. And you’ll experience an inclusive culture that welcomes bold ideas and empowers you to own them to completion.

Do you want to be an integral part of the world's transition to the cloud? The AWS Analytics and Data Solutions (ADS) team is seeking for a Business Analyst (BA) with a combination of superior analytical abilities, business acumen, business judgement, curiosity, technical skills, and written and verbal communication skills to join our team.

Data-driven decision-making is at the core of Amazon’s culture and people who are exceptionally talented at analyzing large sets of data to build insights are critical. Your work will directly impact the decisions and strategy of the entire AWS Infrastructure Services org and our customers. You will be gathering customer needs and insights, mining large and diverse data sets from across AWS Infrastructure, building visualizations and tools for our business partners, generating insights to help senior leaders make critical business decisions. As a Business Analyst, you will work with ADS Infra Team's key stakeholders to leverage our data to drive operational efficiencies, provide key data-driven insights, enable new opportunities and innovate on behalf of our stakeholders.

The business analyst must be a self-starter, comfortable with ambiguity, able to think big and be creative (while still paying careful attention to detail), and enjoy working in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. If you are excited about data, are results-oriented, and want to join a growing analytics team within Amazon - this role is for you!

Working at Atlassian

Atlassians can choose where they work – whether in an office, from home, or a combination of the two. That way, Atlassians have more control over supporting their family, personal goals, and other priorities. We can hire people in any country where we have a legal entity. Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company.

Atlassian is looking for a passionate data and analytics expert who will power-up our teams to derive even more meaningful financial insights from data. Is that you?

You love working a job that can drive real changes with data. You are not fazed by the complexity and volume of data nor the dynamic sources and platforms where these datasets may reside, and understand the value this data provides when we make critical business decisions. You thrive in an environment where you are charting your own course and working on problems for which there is no clear solution; where creativity is as crucial as your ability to write code. You are someone who thrives in a high-performing team and enjoys working in a dynamic environment with plenty of opportunities to learn and develop. With strong partner engagement skills, you are able to juggle competing priorities and deliver on deadlines.

Responsibilities

Our team is looking for someone who is passionate about data, a self-starter, highly organized, analytical and has a good eye for detail.

You will become the Principal Data Analyst on the team who not only understands the financial data at Atlassian but also knows how to use it to make that data actionable. You will be supporting theForecasting team, as well as partnering with the Financial Modelling (Anaplan) and Data Engineering teams to enhance FP&A’s forecast models.

You love thinking about how the business can benefit from this data, and you will have access to an analytics platform (built on Amazon Web Services) to create new data assets, automate analyses and reporting, and create insightful visualisations.

Qualifications

On your first day, we’ll expect you to have:


8+ years of experience in complex data analytics or relevant experience using data to drive insights at industry-leading or fast-growing companies
Expertise in SQL, Tableau, Excel, and other analytics tools
Ability to adapt quickly and effectively to changing environments and initiatives
An excellent communicator and passionate to collaborate with global, multi-functional teams
A willingness to accept failure, learn and try again



It’s Preferred, But Not Required That You Have


A degree in Business, Statistics, Finance, Engineering, or a related analytical field
Technology or Software / SaaS industry experience
Experience using Databricks, Python, and dbt
Experience with ETL, Data Warehousing
Familiarity with Statistics and different forecasting methodologies



Compensation

At Atlassian, we strive to design equitable, explainable, and competitive compensation programs. To support this goal, the baseline of our range is higher than that of the typical market range, but in turn we expect to hire most candidates near this baseline. Base pay within the range is ultimately determined by a candidate's skills, expertise, or experience. In the United States, we have three geographic pay zones. For this role, our current base pay ranges for new hires in each zone are:

Zone A: $149,000 - $198,700

Zone B: $134,100 - $178,800

We’re building the next generation of recruiting software and we’re starting with a suite of products that helps talent leaders, recruiters, and hiring managers run an efficient and data-driven hiring process.

We are well-funded and backed by great investors, including Y Combinator, Elad Gil and Lachy Groom. We have over 1,500 amazing customers including Ramp, Notion, OpenAI and Zapier – yet we've only taken the first steps toward a much larger opportunity. In short, it's the perfect time to join! 🚀

About This Role

👋 Hi, I’m Kevin, I manage the data team and analytics products at Ashby. With Ashby’s ongoing growth we’re entering a new phase where the role of data will become more important than ever before. With that in mind, I’m looking for a talented data analyst to join our dynamic team!

As a data analyst at Ashby you’ll primarily be focused on product-related analytical questions. This will cover the gamut of most standard analyses and related assets (analysis summaries, metric monitoring, dashboards, etc). Given Ashby is well-positioned to capture global recruiting data, our product analyses naturally lend themselves to global job market benchmark reports which are highly valuable to Ashby and the broader employer and candidate job markets (see our Talent Trends for some examples).

Your responsibilities will cover the whole data funnel: starting from raw or lightly modeled data all the way through final analysis summary. When appropriate, you will be responsible for analysis work that become standardized internal dashboards for other Ashby team members. All in, you will have broad analytical ownership and responsibilities, so this is a role best fit for a curious and ambitious type that enjoys touching the whole data analysis ecosystem.

If you are a product-minded analyst, given Ashby supports a whole recruiting analytics product line there is a very real potential that your internal analysis work could contribute directly to our product. This is not a requirement, but I see it as a genuinely likely possibility and an added bonus.

Data Culture at Ashby

At Ashby, we draw a clear distinction between when to look to data for ""the answer"" and when to use data to aid principled thinking for decision making. In general, a primary consideration is whether or not data is needed to help clarify points of uncertainty. When data is considered necessary, a secondary consideration is to what depth data will be required. Data questions lend themselves to ongoing what about... or what if... explorations, which can be important in some situations but are not always necessary. With these dynamics in mind, we do not foster an environment where every decision we make should be backed by data, but we do foster an environment where teammates ask whether or not data will fit the task at hand well. This, in turn, allows us to operate a lean team focused on projects where data provides true leverage to our overall business and product goals.

As a related but distinct point, Ashby’s data culture as far as transparency and access goes is very open. We share company-wide access to our financial standings, progress, and goals and generally make any data and reporting we do consider valuable broadly available. Outside of constraints related to whether a teammate has access to a particular tool, there are close to no constraints on access the state of the company as told by data or reporting. In general, we would like to continue and extend open access to data throughout the company (with your help!), but with consideration and not as a substitute for principled thinking :)

Requirements

The essence of this role dictates you must be analytical, conversant in statistical reasoning, capable of managing the data you work with and distilling results into the appropriate downstream assets. There are a lot of ways to meet those responsibilities. If the dot product of your skill vector with this requirements vector is close to 1, please consider applying, but please note it does not have to be 1.0.


Expertise in SQL-based data analysis
Strong in analytical and statistical thinking - you must be able to generate insights
Expertise with data visualization (i.e. visual communication of results)
Proficiency in Python (primarily in the domain of data analysis and visualization)
Interest in working directly with business partners, e.g. product or go-to-market teammates, to identify and plan related analysis efforts
Proficiency building internal “data products” based on your analysis results, e.g. high-usage dashboards via BI tools (Looker, Tableau, etc) for various business partners
Excellent written and verbal communication. Ashby has a writing-centric culture, but you will also be responsible for direct collaboration with various teammates
Very detail-oriented: in your analysis work you can anticipate complications and identify bad-but-not-obviously-wrong data discrepancies
Experience modeling and working with product analytics events


You could be a great fit if


You identify as exceptionally curious by nature
You could pass as an “analytics engineer” or have working proficiency in dbt-based data modeling
You have been a first or early data analyst at a growing, fast-moving startup
You have working experience in B2B SaaS and understand how analysis facilitates business success
You have an intuition for solving problems pragmatically and an eye for leverage
You enjoy collaboration and find reward in enabling other teammates to succeed
You have strong, experience-backed opinions about data products and data culture in a company setting
Familiarity with our data stack is a bonus, but not a requirement
Have a passion for refining the role of data within company environments, spanning everything from communication standards and data request management - you’ll help shape this as Ashby grows
You can appreciate the whole distribution as much as a point estimator


Reasons not to apply


You do not enjoy working directly with analysts or other business stakeholders. This role will require working closely and in earnest with teammates across the company as various data-related needs come up.
You are looking for consumer-scale data infrastructure projects. We have a huge and interesting set of data to work with (check out our data trends reports!), but we are a B2B SaaS company. Relative to B2C services, we might best be considered small but mighty :)
You are seeking an in-person work experience. Although there are hot spots of Ashby employees around the world, Ashby is a remote workplace. Rest assured, we do meet up in person for various events throughout the year!
You want to be on a large team of analysts. The data team at Ashby is lean, so you will be primarily working with a data engineering partner and your manager (me!). That said, you will be working directly with many team members across the company, so your teammates in the analysis sense will be the diversity of folks you collaborate with on analysis to analysis.


Ashby's Data Stack

As it will undoubtedly be a point of interest, a quick summary of our data stack is provided here. Our production database is postgres, which we integrate into a Snowflake data warehouse via a custom data pipeline. All other business systems are integrated via Fivetran. We use Prefect for orchestration and dbt for data modeling. Frontend event tracking is done via Rudderstack. Data visualization and reporting varies, but the broader company is primarily served standardized analytics via Looker. For version control we use Git/Github (and Github Actions for CI/CD). As an Analyst, you'll be at liberty to work in a notebook or tool of your choice. Internal documentation lives in Slab.

Interview Process

Our interview process is thorough — we aim to ensure each person that joins the team is the right fit for Ashby and will provide ample information for you to assess if Ashby is the right fit for you. The process for this role is as follows:


Hiring Manager Screen - 30 to 45 min
Take home mini-analysis & review
Final Round - about 2.5 to 3 hours (can do multi-day)


Note: please do not reach out to the broader Ashby team requesting more information or time to connect. We will diligently review all applications in detail after the public posting period is over.

Benefits


Competitive salary and equity.
10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.
Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it 😅.
Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.
Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!
$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.
If you’re in the US, top-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us.


Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.

If you've made it this far and are excited about Ashby, please apply and follow us on LinkedIn to stay up to date!

Compensation Range: $120K - $150K

Design A/B tests and execute analyses to evaluate the impact of new product features and operational improvements
Work closely with cross-functional partners to deliver data-driven insights and actionable recommendations for continuously improving the customer support experience
Monitor and diagnose KPI performance and present findings to senior leadership

Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It’s where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you’ll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You’ll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Creating a life you love also means finding a career that celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences that you bring. As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

The mission of the Business Operations team is to assess how well Pinterest’s strategy is delivering enterprise performance and influence exec-level decisions to evolve strategy and operations accordingly. As the Lead Data Analyst (Trust & Safety), you will shape and deliver on the analytical agenda that provides critical business insights for our Exec Team while partnering with Product, Engineering, Data Science, and others to improve how we execute. With a combination of exceptional analytical skills, insatiable curiosity, and strong partnering skills, you’ll help us better understand how to keep Pinterest a safe, inspiring platform and drive changes that shape its future.

What You’ll Do


Business Analytics & Reporting. Develop a deep understanding of the Trust & Safety challenges and roadmap and how they drive our business / user experience to inform important decisions and priorities across the organization. Define critical KPIs and build core operating dashboards to help teams drive operational rigor and manage performance. Be the primary point person with our senior leadership on understanding metrics movements and trends in our business.

Exceptional data analysis skills. You’re a true expert in a variety of analytical tools, including SQL, Tableau, and Excel (and in areas you’re not, you have the growth mindset to learn it); knowledge of Python and R is a plus.
Entrepreneurial self-starter. You thrive in a fast-moving, ambiguous environment, and are independently capable of seeking information, corralling resources, and delivering results without waiting for direction.
Strong communication skills. You can move seamlessly between conversing with engineers or frontline ops employees and leading presentations with senior executives.
High-energy, positive team player. You have a proven ability to build strong working relationships with business partners; this is a highly cross-functional role, so a low ego and a high instinct for collaboration are musts.
Keen aptitude to scale the team. Help build out processes for a small (but mighty) team. Help build our influence across the organization to tackle each of the above for your coverage area.

Understanding our users and their behavior allows us to offer the best possible gaming experience, and happy users = happy company. So how do we best understand our

users? By understanding our data!

We’re looking for a Data Analyst who will work in a product team to investigate, understand, and present insights on our data. This figure must be proactive in preempting business needs, with the goal of using data to help the company make better decisions.

Designing and evaluating experiments (A/B testing)
Guiding the product team in the creation and modification of features based on analyses and trends




🎮 To start playing, you will need:

SQL (and relational databases)
Basic Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) or R
Data Visualization tools (Tableau, Domo, Looker, Grafana, etc.)
Fluent English




👤 The type of player you are:

Highly analytical
Good communication skills
Desire for self-improvement




👑 Our company values:

Use critical thinking: don't assume, validate your gut feeling!
Take ownership and make it happen!
Love what you do and have fun doing it!
Work on the problem, not just the symptoms!
Don't overcomplicate it, keep it simple and effective!
Share ideas to reduce bias and improve results!







🌈 Power-ups to have more fun

🏡 Smart Working policy

🥳 An innovative, dynamic, and friendly work environment in which you will have the opportunity to grow personally and professionally, thanks to our amazing team

🏢 Amazing HQ office in the centre of Milan (M2 – Stazione Garibaldi)

🇬🇧 English courses provided by a native teacher (related to your English level)

🎤 Monthly Product/Design/Marketing/Tech panels to be aligned with all departments’ results

💻 Amazing workstation with the latest MacBook Pro and a Display Screen (Whatever makes you work better is welcome!)

📄 A top-notch contract proposal

🍽️ Ticket restaurant when working from the office

🍕 Free Coffee & Beer; once a month pizza lunch together

🕙 Flexible work hours

🏄 Internal Team Building events

🛋️ Relax Area with Sofà, Foosball Table, and Board Games




Don't live in Milan? Check out our work model




Building community and having a place to connect with each other is very important for us. We like not only to work together, but to have time to get to know each other, to celebrate and have fun. We also value people's choice to work from anywhere, that's why we have a very flexible hybrid model.




Our policy is 4 days per month at the office, and we decide however we're gonna go. There are people who like to go once every week, or two days every two weeks, four days straight, or even combining the last 4 days of one month with the first 4 days of the next month and only go 8 days straight every two months. Whatever works best for you!




If you don’t live in Italy, we have two options: if you would like to relocate, our company offers a relocation package to help you move to Milan; if you want to stay where you are, we offer a benefit to help you with travel expenses and flexible working hours around your journey time.

Department overview:

Its members interact on a regular basis with many senior leaders in the firm.

Over the past 5+ years, Bain has invested into establishing a new partner role (‘Expert Partner’), focused on partner-level talent with differentiated skill spikes than generalist partners, while equally accomplished.  As this new talent platform matures, a key focus is to drive greater alignment and integration across our Expert and Generalist Partner talent platforms.
