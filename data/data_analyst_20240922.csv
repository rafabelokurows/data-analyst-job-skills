About Us

""LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

Über uns

admi Kommunal GmbH - Gemeinsam mit Städten und Gemeinden treiben wir die kommunale Energiewende voran.

Wir unterstützen Kommunen bei der Planung und Umsetzung ihrer energiepolitischen Ambitionen kompetent und zielgerichtet. Damit beschleunigen wir u.a. den Photovoltaikausbau auf allen kommunalen Liegenschaften. Dank unserer technologiegetriebenen Herangehensweise, Prozessexzellenz und Erfahrung in der Zusammenarbeit mit staatlichen Institutionen, bringen wir Kommunen innerhalb weniger Wochen ihrer autonomen Energieversorgung und CO2-Neutralität näher. Davon profitiert langfristig nicht nur der Klimaschutz, sondern auch alle Steuerzahler. Dabei agieren wir als echte Partner der modernen, effektiven Verwaltung in Deutschland.

Mit hunderten von erfolgreich realisierten Projekten haben wir uns schon nach wenigen Monaten erfolgreich am Markt etabliert und dabei tausende Tonnen CO2 eingespart.

Aber die Zeit rennt: Heute entfallen noch rund 38% aller CO2-Emissionen in Deutschland auf die Kommunen. Gleichzeitig verpflichtet die Europäische Union ihre Mitgliedsstaaten, alle geeigneten öffentlichen Dächer bis 2030 mit Photovoltaik auszustatten, um die Klimaneutralität voranzutreiben. Dieses Ziel können wir nur erreichen, wenn wir in den nächsten Jahren weiter so viele Kommunen wie möglich auf dem Weg in die komplette Klimaneutralität unterstützen. Und dafür brauchen wir Dich!

Wenn Du uns auf unserer Mission mit Deinem Talent, deiner Passion und Deiner Tatkraft unterstützen möchtest, freuen wir uns auf Deine Bewerbung.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

We’re a company on a mission - We are a unique Canadian Fintech that is the one stop shop for all financial needs of the consumer - Save, Spend, Borrow, Invest, and Protect. Every single team member, from product & engineering to sales & marketing, finance, operations, and everything in between is obsessed with one thing; helping Canadians make better financial choices. And we’re pretty great at it, too. Via our digital application technology and our award-winning in-house brokerages, we help over 2M Canadians per month make a positive impact on their finances. We have many unique businesses - a mortgage brokerage, a life insurance brokerage, a home and auto insurance brokerage, a mortgage originations and servicing business, a Financial Services Marketplace and a content business across Ratehub and MoneySense. 365 days a year we deliver our users the best online mortgage experience, personalized Credit Card and Loans options, and cheaper auto & home insurance policies than they typically get from their existing financial adviser.

Changing how people make financial choices isn’t easy, though. We know that achieving our mission is full of challenges; challenges that can be complex and often unexpected, but that are always interesting, rewarding, and fun to solve as a team. This is where you come in. We are on the hunt for the right kind of people to join us and help lead us forward to continued growth.

We have a newly created Data Team that is capturing data, analyzing it, harvesting it, modeling it to provide meaningful insights to our Members and to our businesses. We’re looking for a top performing Data Analyst to join this team, which will be the backbone of all the businesses (based in downtown Toronto but also open to remote candidates)! Reporting to the Head of Data, the Data Analyst is a critical member of Ratehub’s team who will drive decision making across the company. You will work on high impact projects with business stakeholders and will need to use data to solve long-term and immediate business problems. The role will involve data analysis, modeling and insights development. The ideal candidate has strong communications skills, a passion for data, a background in quantitative analysis and an interest in personal finance. You will get the opportunity to work closely with the other analysts in the team as well as the business stakeholders to learn different parts of the business and provide valuable support with data reporting and analysis across various business units.

Your Responsibilities


Drive business strategy by engaging with key stakeholders to understand the business vision, requirements & priorities and help to translate this into actionable insights
Analyze data to drive meaningful insights on consumer behavior, consumer’s financial needs, attitudes, pricing, revenue management, modeling and AI
Model, build, and maintain scorecards for different parts of the business using our BI tool
Collaborate with the other analysts to support product, marketing, sales and finance teams with ad hoc analysis and reporting
Support in developing and maintaining our data model by understanding key data sources and relationships between them


Your Qualifications


1-2 years’ of relevant work experience at an internet / ecommerce company (including co-ops and internships) required
Post-secondary degree: We value intelligence over relevance, but a Bachelors in Computer Science would be looked upon favorably
High proficiency with SQL for data analysis
Some knowledge of BI & reporting tools e.g. Looker, Tableau, Sisense, QlikView
Knowledge of Python or R is considered an asset
Experience with a web analytics tool to support product and marketing analysis will be an asset
Exposure to cloud infrastructure such as AWS, Azure or GCP is nice to have


BEYOND THE TECHNICAL YOU ARE:


Strong Analytical Skills
Detail oriented: High standard of data quality and integrity
Resourceful: You don’t have all the answers, but you know how to get them
Strong problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities
Adaptable to a fast paced environment and able to pivot quickly to align with changing priorities


CULTURE FIT:


No Ego: No task is too big or small. You are never afraid to ask questions when you are trying to learn and understand things. You have no problem rolling up your sleeves and helping to execute when the team needs help. This humility extends to all aspects of your work and interaction with teammates
Player Coach: You mentor and teach as you execute. You model the behaviour you expect from your team. You don’t just tell others what to do, you know and show how to do it at a high standard
Growth mindset: You have a desire to always continue to grow and learn. This means a willingness to get outside your comfort zone and try new things because you view these as opportunities to gain skills and knowledge
Helping Hand: You always offer to help without having to be asked. You go the extra mile to help out regardless of your team and function
Get S##T Done: Your bias is towards action. This means pitching in and rallying to get things across the finish line. Rather than putting off work ask yourself what you can do today to move the needle on a project or goal
Digs Deep: You aren't afraid to ask questions because you want to understand every issue so that you can properly solve the root cause of the problem instead of just completing the task you are given


JOB PERKS:


Competitive salary: We know life is expensive
Flexible hours: Enjoy a couple more hours of sleep in the morning, if you want
Benefits: Health is wealth! A benefits package with no employee contribution required
Perks: RRSP matching program, individual training allowance, access to financial literacy training and resources
Casual dress code: If it’s good enough for you, it’s good enough for us
Fun team socials

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

As a team member with the Reporting, Insights and Performance Team at ATB, you can expect:


Each week, month and quarter will require you to build on what you've learned previously as we’re learning, iterating and making big steps towards our vision of executing our 2030 Strategy.
We focus on outcomes, not outputs. You will typically be presented with problems to solve and not tasks to complete.

You will be part of building an effective horizontal data team.
