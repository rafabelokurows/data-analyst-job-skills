Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About TikTok U.S. Data Security
TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. U.S. Data Security (“USDS”) is a subsidiary of TikTok in the U.S. This new, security-first division was created to bring heightened focus and governance to our data protection policies and content assurance protocols to keep U.S. users safe. Our focus is on providing oversight and protection of the TikTok platform and U.S. user data, so millions of Americans can continue turning to TikTok to learn something new, earn a living, express themselves creatively, or be entertained. The teams within USDS that deliver on this commitment daily span across Trust & Safety, Security & Privacy, Engineering, User & Product Ops, Corporate Functions and more.

Why Join Us
Creation is the core of TikTok's purpose. Our platform is built to help imaginations thrive. This is doubly true of the teams that make TikTok possible.
Together, we inspire creativity and bring joy - a mission we all believe in and aim towards achieving every day.
To us, every challenge, no matter how difficult, is an opportunity; to learn, to innovate, and to grow as one team. Status quo? Never. Courage? Always.
At TikTok, we create together and grow together. That's how we drive impact - for ourselves, our company, and the communities we serve.
Join us.

The USDS-Platform and Community Integrity (PaCI) team is missioned to: - Protect U.S. TikTok users, including and beyond content consumers, creators, and advertisers; - Secure platform health and community experience authenticity; - Build infrastructures, platforms, and technologies, as well as to collaborate with many cross-functional teams and stakeholders. The PaCI team works to minimize the damage of inauthentic behaviors on TikTok platforms, covering multiple classical and novel community and business risk areas such as account integrity, engagement authenticity, anti-spam, API abuse, growth fraud, live streaming security and financial safety, etc. In this team, you'll have a unique opportunity to have first-hand exposure to the strategy of the company in key security initiatives, especially in building scalable and robust, intelligent and privacy-safe, secure, and product-friendly systems and solutions. Our challenges are not some regular day-to-day technical puzzles -- You'll be part of a team that's developing novel solutions to first-seen challenges of a non-stop evolution of a phenomenal product eco-system. The work needs to be fast, transferrable, while still down to the ground to make quick and solid differences.

In order to enhance collaboration and cross-functional partnerships, among other things, at this time, our organization follows a hybrid work schedule that requires employees to work in the office 3 days a week, or as directed by their manager/department. We regularly review our hybrid work model, and the specific requirements may change at any time.

Quantify risk control effects and trends, collaborate with engineering, modeling, operational and product colleagues, contribute to risk measurement, perception, mitigation and prevention with data stories.

Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications:
Bachelor or degrees above in computer science, statistics, math, internet security or other relevant majors (e.g., finance if applying for financial fraud roles)

Preferred Qualifications:
Familiarity with social/content online platform analytics. Bonus given to proficiency in data mining skills e.g. modern machine applications.
Ability to think critically, objectively, rationally. Reason and communicate in result-oriented, data-driven manner. High autonomy.

TikTok is committed to creating an inclusive space where employees are valued for their skills, experiences, and unique perspectives. Our platform connects people from across the globe and so does our workplace. At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. To achieve that goal, we are committed to celebrating our diverse voices and to creating an environment that reflects the many communities we reach. We are passionate about this and hope you are too.

T&C is a family-owned company that builds authentic relationships one interaction at a time through consistent commitment to heartfelt service, relating to people as people (not numbers) and by selling the freshest, highest-quality products available.

Who You Are

You are genuine and authentic in your interactions both with your customers and co-workers. You thrive in a team environment, take your responsibilities seriously, and always consider the customer in your decisions. You see richness and strength in a diverse workforce and treat others with respect to create a place of belonging for all. You care about your community and the environment. Pursuing knowledge in order to add value and grow is your idea of fun. Oh, and you love food!

WHAT WE OFFER (IN ADDITION TO BEING A FUN PLACE TO WORK)

We have a highly competitive benefits package ($5-$19 weekly medical premiums), vacation/sick time, paid holidays, premium pay rates, an Employee Assistance Program, a discount on virtually everything in our markets, 401(k) plans, profit-sharing and a pension, scholarship program and an employee referral bonus program. Whoa! That’s a lot of great stuff!

THE SMALL PRINT WE WANT YOU TO BE AWARE OF

T&C is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. We value a diverse workplace and do not discriminate based on race, color, national origin, religion, caste, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other applicable characteristic protected by law. We invite women, people of color, LGBTQ individuals, members of ethnic minorities, foreign-born residents, and veterans to apply. Duties and responsibilities may be added, deleted, or changed at any time at the discretion of management, formally or informally, either verbally or in writing.

If your experience looks a little different from what we’ve identified and you think you can thrive in this role, we’d love to learn more about you. Research shows that women and members of other under-represented groups tend to not apply to jobs when they think they may not meet every qualification, when, in fact, they often do! We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment and strongly encourage you to apply.

Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It’s where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you’ll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You’ll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Creating a life you love also means finding a career that celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences that you bring. As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

The mission of the Business Operations team is to assess how well Pinterest’s strategy is delivering enterprise performance and influence exec-level decisions to evolve strategy and operations accordingly. As the Data Analyst II (Users & Engagement), you will shape, support and deliver on the analytical agenda that provides critical business insights for our Exec Team while partnering with Product, Engineering, Data Science, and others to improve how we execute. With a combination of exceptional analytical skills, insatiable curiosity, and strong partnering skills, you’ll help us better understand how to grow user adoption and engagement on Pinterest.

What You’ll Do


Business Analytics & Reporting. Develop a deep understanding of the Users & Engagement challenges and roadmap and how they drive our business / user experience to inform important decisions and priorities across the organization. Define critical KPIs and build key reporting deliverables and dashboards to help senior leadership understand key metric movements and trends, drive operational rigor and manage performance.
Planning & Forecasting. Manage the forecast models for core topline metrics that drive company-wide forecasting, goal-setting, and strategic planning. Work with a range of senior leaders to update their strategic priorities and goals on a regular basis.
Strategy & Special Projects. Tackle ambiguous strategic questions and critical business initiatives, and partner with leaders throughout Pinterest to build business cases for potential investments. Present insights and recommendations to senior leadership, and drive the “follow through” of those recommendations to ensure smooth execution with a diverse array of cross-functional partners.



What We’re Looking For


Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as economics, business administration, or data analytics or equivalent experience.
3+ years of experience in analytical or strategic roles. You’ve been a top performer in an investing, consulting, investment banking, product, and/or other highly analytical role at a fast-growing company; knowledge of the consumer internet and media ecosystem is a plus.
Exceptional data analysis skills. You’re a true expert in a variety of analytical tools, including SQL, Tableau, and Excel (and in areas you’re not, you have the growth mindset to learn it); knowledge of Python and R is a plus.
Entrepreneurial self-starter. You thrive in a fast-moving, ambiguous environment, and are independently capable of seeking information, corralling resources, and delivering results without waiting for direction.
Strong communication skills. You can move seamlessly between conversing with engineers or frontline ops employees and leading presentations with senior executives.
High-energy, positive team player. You have a proven ability to build strong working relationships with business partners; this is a highly cross-functional role, so a low ego and a high instinct for collaboration are musts.
Keen aptitude to scale the team. Help build out processes for a small (but mighty) team. Help build our influence across the organization to tackle each of the above for your coverage area.



Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement

This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 1-2 times/quarter and therefore can be situated anywhere in the country.

Final salary is based on a number of factors including location, travel, relevant prior experience, or particular skills and expertise.

Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It’s where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you’ll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You’ll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Creating a life you love also means finding a career that celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences that you bring. As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

The mission of the Business Operations team is to assess how well Pinterest’s strategy is delivering enterprise performance and influence exec-level decisions to evolve strategy and operations accordingly. As the Lead Data Analyst (Trust & Safety), you will shape and deliver on the analytical agenda that provides critical business insights for our Exec Team while partnering with Product, Engineering, Data Science, and others to improve how we execute. With a combination of exceptional analytical skills, insatiable curiosity, and strong partnering skills, you’ll help us better understand how to keep Pinterest a safe, inspiring platform and drive changes that shape its future.

What You’ll Do


Business Analytics & Reporting. Develop a deep understanding of the Trust & Safety challenges and roadmap and how they drive our business / user experience to inform important decisions and priorities across the organization. Define critical KPIs and build core operating dashboards to help teams drive operational rigor and manage performance. Be the primary point person with our senior leadership on understanding metrics movements and trends in our business.
Strategy & Special Projects. Tackle key strategic questions and critical business initiatives, and partner with leaders throughout Pinterest to build business cases for potential investments. Present insights and recommendations to senior leadership, and drive the “follow through” of those recommendations to ensure smooth execution with a diverse array of cross-functional partners.
Planning & Forecasting. Manage the forecast models for core topline metrics that drive company-wide forecasting, goal-setting, and strategic planning. Work with senior leaders to update their strategic priorities and goals on a regular basis.



What We’re Looking For


Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as economics, business administration, or data analytics or equivalent experience. MBA optional
7+ years of experience in analytical or strategic roles with at least 2 years in Trust & Safety. You’ve been a top performer in an analytical role and have a strong background in and passion for Trust & Safety.
Exceptional data analysis skills. You’re a true expert in a variety of analytical tools, including SQL, Tableau, and Excel (and in areas you’re not, you have the growth mindset to learn it); knowledge of Python and R is a plus.
Entrepreneurial self-starter. You thrive in a fast-moving, ambiguous environment, and are independently capable of seeking information, corralling resources, and delivering results without waiting for direction.
Strong communication skills. You can move seamlessly between conversing with engineers or frontline ops employees and leading presentations with senior executives.
High-energy, positive team player. You have a proven ability to build strong working relationships with business partners; this is a highly cross-functional role, so a low ego and a high instinct for collaboration are musts.
Keen aptitude to scale the team. Help build out processes for a small (but mighty) team. Help build our influence across the organization to tackle each of the above for your coverage area.

Aurora (Nasdaq: AUR) is delivering the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly to make transportation safer, increasingly accessible, and more reliable and efficient than ever before. The Aurora Driver is a self-driving system designed to operate multiple vehicle types, from freight-hauling semi-trucks to ride-hailing passenger vehicles, and underpins Aurora Horizon and Aurora Connect, its driver-as-a-service products for trucking and ride-hailing.

Responsibilities

In this role, you will be accountable for the accuracy of our top-line data quality metrics and tracking processes. Your responsibilities will largely fall into three areas:


BI tools: comprehensive and accurate dashboards or other visualization to track our progress towards behavior data coverage, as well as internal-facing visualization for the health of our tools, delivery, or offline models.
Data engineering: efficient and robust data pipelines that impact how “fresh” and “correct” our data is. You will work with our Data Platforms and Data Science teams to leverage best practices for design patterns, testing and documentation
Data modeling and analysis: given our business objectives, are the dashboards accurate? Are we tracking the right metrics? You will work with Autonomy leadership and ICs to provide the right data to inform decision making for our software releases, and any blindspots we might have.


Required Qualifications


Experience with SQL and schema design.
Experience with Data warehouse / management tools (e.g., Amazon Athena, Redshift, DBT, etc), and BI tools (e.g., Mode, Holistics, Looker Studio, etc)
Experience developing software using Python.
Experience developing in a Linux or Unix environment.


Desirable Qualifications


Experience in Self Driving / Autonomy Driving or Robotics or Maps
Experience embedded with a product or consumer-facing team
Experience with ML development tooling and infrastructure
Experience with backend infrastructure (e.g., data pipelines, schema design/data models, distributed storage systems, backend microservices, API design)


The base salary range for this position is $92,000-$138,000 per year. Aurora’s pay ranges are determined by role, level, and location. Within the range, the successful candidate’s starting base pay will be determined based on factors including job-related skills, experience, qualifications, relevant education or training, and market conditions. These ranges may be modified in the future. The successful candidate will also be eligible for an annual bonus, equity compensation, and benefits.

As a Senior Data Analyst at Builder.io, you will...


Lead initiatives to modernize our data infrastructure, creating a scalable architecture to support our expansion.

Manage and maintain key data sources accessible via Sigma Analytics, and spearhead enablement programs to boost self-service analytics.
Be hands-on with data modeling and pipeline development using dbt.
Ensure thorough documentation for critical data tables and sources.
Collaborate with teams across the company to provide actionable insights and become a trusted advisor on data-related decisions.


Required Qualifications:


5+ years of experience with SQL, including writing and optimizing complex queries.
Strong grasp of data structures and database management principles.
Proficiency with data visualization tools like Tableau, Looker, or Sigma.
Familiarity with event-based analytics platforms like Amplitude or Mixpanel.
Solid understanding of data warehousing concepts and technologies.
Exceptional analytical and problem-solving abilities.
Strong communication skills, both written and verbal.
Ability to work effectively both independently and as part of a team.
Attention to detail and a commitment to data accuracy.


The items above are a starting point for a conversation, not a hard list of requirements. If this role excites you, we hope you will apply!

The estimated total compensation for the Senior Data Analyst role with 5 years of experience is $100,000 - $170,000 USD for US-based candidates. For candidates in other locations, we will align on the compensation range early in the interview process.

What Builder.io offers you:


Unlimited time off. 3 weeks is the minimum that we will ask you to take each year
Mental health days. We encourage you to take at least one per quarter to recharge
Paid parental leave. 12 weeks of full pay for the birth and care of a newborn child, or for the placement of a child for adoption or foster care
$500 home office reimbursement. Help get what you need to be comfortable working in a digital-first environment
$500 annual learning & development budget. Feel supported and empowered to continue developing your skills
Co-working space reimbursement. Work from any WeWork at anytime with an All Access pass, or reimburse up to $299/month at another local co-working space
Health Insurance. 100% employer-paid premiums for medical, dental, and vision insurance for employees, and 50% covered for eligible dependents
Additional Insurance. Builder covers your life insurance, short- and long-term disability, and you'll have access to supplemental benefits like accident and critical illness insurance
401k (for US based team members). Contribute to your financial future through our Guideline plan
Real equity. We have a four year vesting schedule with a one year cliff. We also have a ten (10!!) year exercise window 🤯 (yeah, we're pretty stoked about it!)

Sobi Culture

At Sobi, we refuse to accept the status quo. This is because we have witnessed first-hand the challenges facing those affected by rare diseases and have used this knowledge to shape our business to find new ways of helping them.

As a specialized biopharmaceutical company, we are dedicated to rare diseases. And we see this focus as a strength. By effectively turning our research into ground-breaking treatments, we help make medicine more accessible and open up more possibilities for patients and more opportunities for those caring for them. This has been our approach since day one, but we know we can’t change the world of rare diseases on our own. Accomplishing this requires strong partnerships with patients, partners and stakeholders across the entire value chain. Together, we define how our business can create solutions that serve the needs of those affected by rare diseases while facilitating sustainable growth.

Building community and having a place to connect with each other is very important for us. We like not only to work together, but to have time to get to know each other, to celebrate and have fun. We also value people's choice to work from anywhere, that's why we have a very flexible hybrid model.




Our policy is 4 days per month at the office, and we decide however we're gonna go. There are people who like to go once every week, or two days every two weeks, four days straight, or even combining the last 4 days of one month with the first 4 days of the next month and only go 8 days straight every two months. Whatever works best for you!




If you don’t live in Italy, we have two options: if you would like to relocate, our company offers a relocation package to help you move to Milan; if you want to stay where you are, we offer a benefit to help you with travel expenses and flexible working hours around your journey time.

Day-to-day, your role includes:


Instituting frameworks across project and campaign lifecycles, including measurement plans, primary and secondary research, and performance reporting
Diving into large data sets, uncovering insights, and providing impactful recommendations to clients
Connecting the dots across channels through data (including display media, site, search, email, and social) to provide a holistic view of marketing efforts
Communicating with clients regularly on scheduled deliverables and ad-hoc requests
Collaborating with internal teams and external partners to drive success for client’s business goals


Qualifications


3-5 years of experience in analytics or strategy
A four-year college degree
Passion for digital marketing and emerging trends in the digital landscape
Experience communicating with internal and external stakeholders at a variety of levels
Fluency with Excel (including pivot tables and vlookups) and/or other data analysis tools such as SQL or Tableau

Instituting frameworks across project and campaign lifecycles, including measurement plans, primary and secondary research, and performance reporting
Diving into large data sets, uncovering insights, and providing impactful recommendations to clients
Connecting the dots across channels through data (including display media, site, search, email, and social) to provide a holistic view of marketing efforts
Communicating with clients regularly on scheduled deliverables and ad-hoc requests
Collaborating with internal teams and external partners to drive success for client’s business goals


Qualifications


3-5 years of experience in analytics or strategy
A four-year college degree
Passion for digital marketing and emerging trends in the digital landscape
Experience communicating with internal and external stakeholders at a variety of levels
Fluency with Excel (including pivot tables and vlookups) and/or other data analysis tools such as SQL or Tableau
