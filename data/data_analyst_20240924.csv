About Us

""LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

THE ROLE

Data is a core advantage of OTT/Unicast TV over traditional broadcast. As platform operators, we know exactly what content our users watch, how popular a show is, and how many seconds of each and every ad campaign is viewed.

Back in 2005, we pioneered Europe's first TV streaming service. Today, we're the world's first certified climate neutral TV streaming provider. 3 million users across three countries. Over 230 colleagues of 47 nationalities. We're the grown-up start-up, helping to shape a better future since day one. That hasn't changed, even if the world has. We're friendly, international, inclusive – and our people say we're reliable and transparent, too. It's why they trust us and believe in what we do.

THE ROLE

Data is a core advantage of OTT/Unicast TV over traditional broadcast. As platform operators, we know exactly what content our users watch, how popular a show is, and how many seconds of each and every ad campaign is viewed. With roughly 3 million active users every month the data we collect from them allows for efficient and precise business processes and data-based decision making.

We want to build day-to-day business decisions more on hard facts and less on gut feeling. Therefore we are searching for a passionate Data Analyst to join our motivated and growing data team. You will be shaping the big data architecture at Zattoo and building data components that change the way data is leveraged at Zattoo!

We love bringing more value out of our data for the organization and truly drive data based decision making in all divisions.

Zattoo operates in both the DtC and B2B space and combined with a TV streaming product, it is a dream company for a data professional to get maximum value out of data and learn new things everyday!

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Jigsaw. Have you got what it takes?

The software industry is rapidly evolving, driven by the demand for more immediate, actionable insights. Traditional business intelligence tools often fall short in delivering the speed and depth of analysis that clients require in a fast-paced, data-driven environment. Businesses that can’t keep up with this demand risk losing out to competitors who are more agile and technologically advanced. Our approach to this challenge is to merge cutting-edge AI with proven BI tools to create a new breed of business intelligence solutions. By integrating generative AI into platforms like Tableau and Alteryx, we’re transforming them into powerful, predictive tools that can significantly enhance client satisfaction and drive business success.

This role is not for someone looking to simply run complex data models or stay behind the scenes. It’s about practical application—using AI and BI to build data visualizations and pipelines that are as reliable as they are innovative. Unlike a data scientist role, which might focus more on theoretical models, this position demands a deep understanding of client needs and a commitment to turning those needs into tangible, high-quality solutions. This is a client-centric role where your ability to consult, advise, and deliver will set you apart.

At Jigsaw you will be joining a team at the forefront of AI-enhanced business intelligence, where your contributions will directly influence the direction of the industry. If you’re passionate about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with AI and BI, and you thrive in a dynamic, client-focused environment, this is the opportunity to make a real impact.

What You Will Be Doing


Data Visualization Creation: Producing Tableau dashboards and other data visualization outputs for clients
Data Pipeline Development: Building and enhancing data workflows using Alteryx
Client Consultation: Engaging with clients to define requirements, provide recommendations, and ensure that our solutions meet their business needs


Business Intelligence Consultant Key Responsibilities


Use AI to accelerate the delivery of business intelligence solutions and significantly improve client satisfaction


Basic Requirements


Must be based in the European Union, United Kingdom, or EEA
At least 5 years of experience using Tableau in a professional capacity
Professional experience using Alteryx
Professional experience using generative AI tools to speed up BI processes
Professional experience translating technical information into non-technical business language that customers can easily understand


About Jigsaw

Delivered on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform, Jigsaw’s virtual learning and collaboration technology enables our customers to revolutionize how they train, educate, collaborate and work through a virtual environment – helping them embrace digital transformation and enhance their organizations’ success.

Traditional business intelligence tools often fall short in delivering the speed and depth of analysis that clients require in a fast-paced, data-driven environment. Businesses that can’t keep up with this demand risk losing out to competitors who are more agile and technologically advanced. Our approach to this challenge is to merge cutting-edge AI with proven BI tools to create a new breed of business intelligence solutions. By integrating generative AI into platforms like Tableau and Alteryx, we’re transforming them into powerful, predictive tools that can significantly enhance client satisfaction and drive business success.<br><br>This role is not for someone looking to simply run complex data models or stay behind the scenes. It’s about practical application—using AI and BI to build data visualizations and pipelines that are as reliable as they are innovative. Unlike a data scientist role, which might focus more on theoretical models, this position demands a deep understanding of client needs and a commitment to turning those needs into tangible, high-quality solutions. This is a client-centric role where your ability to consult, advise, and deliver will set you apart.<br><br>At Jigsaw you will be joining a team at the forefront of AI-enhanced business intelligence, where your contributions will directly influence the direction of the industry.

About Us

With over 150 million customers in 45+ countries, Bolt is one of the fastest-growing tech companies in Europe and Africa. And it's all thanks to our people.

We believe in creating an inclusive environment where everyone is welcome, regardless of race, colour, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, age, or disability.

Our ultimate goal is to make cities for people, not cars, and we need your help to achieve this mission!

About The Role

Join us as a Senior Product Analyst at Marketplace and take a seat in our journey to revolutionise ride-hailing!

As a catalyst for discovery, you will boost the efficiency of current mechanics and contribute to the development of new frameworks in matching and pricing domains. You will have an opportunity to fully leverage your profound expertise in causal inference, applied statistics, and microeconomics in the enhancement of the platform's matching algorithms, ensuring the optimal pairing of riders and drivers. Similarly, you will navigate the intricacies of supply and demand pricing strategies, applying your analytical acumen to guarantee the best possible outcomes for both parties.

Marketplace team’s objective is to optimise entire systems as opposed to targeting the user experience (rider’s or driver’s), which translates to the truly unique problems you would be cracking. Curious to get a sneak peek of what these can be? Scroll down to the next section to find out!

Your daily adventures will include:


Defining research questions & conducting analysis on matching/pricing features’ retrospective performance, identifying points of improvements, designing new solutions based on your analysis
Owning and enforcing AB testing best practices end-to-end, e.g. designing experiments, validating features, identifying markets that would benefit from the feature, drawing conclusions and recommending next steps to the stakeholders
Proposing and designing brand new metrics to improve our Experimentation inference, making our decisions better and faster
Contributing to the conceptualisation and development of in-house analytical solutions (e.g. in-house marketplace simulations)
Closely collaborating with Product Managers and Engineers to prioritise internal projects, actively enriching the team’s roadmap by proposing technical solutions and/or product improvements



About you:


You hold Bachelor's and/or Master’s degree in Economics, Data Science, Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics
You have at least 3+ years of experience working in advanced Analytics and/or Data Science
You are a true ambassador of best practices in Experimentations end-to-end: from feature & test design stages till the test conclusion and rollout decisions
You are confident in applying basic notions of microeconomics on practice
You have a solid understanding of supervised ML frameworks (e.g. Linear, DT, GB regression & classification models)
You rank your SQL skills as “outstanding” & Python skills as “profound”



Experience is great, but what we really look for is drive, intelligence, and integrity. So even if you don’t tick every box, please consider applying if you feel you’re the kind of person described above!

Why you’ll love it here:


Play a direct role in shaping the future of mobility.
Impact millions of customers and partners in 500+ cities across 45 countries.
Work in fast-moving autonomous teams with some of the smartest people in the world.
Accelerate your professional growth with unique career opportunities.
Get a rewarding salary and stock option package that lets you focus on doing your best work.
Enjoy the flexibility of working in a hybrid mode.
Take care of your physical and mental health with our wellness perks.
Some perks may differ depending on your location.

And we’re pretty great at it, too. Via our digital application technology and our award-winning in-house brokerages, we help over 2M Canadians per month make a positive impact on their finances. We have many unique businesses - a mortgage brokerage, a life insurance brokerage, a home and auto insurance brokerage, a mortgage originations and servicing business, a Financial Services Marketplace and a content business across Ratehub and MoneySense. 365 days a year we deliver our users the best online mortgage experience, personalized Credit Card and Loans options, and cheaper auto & home insurance policies than they typically get from their existing financial adviser.

Changing how people make financial choices isn’t easy, though. We know that achieving our mission is full of challenges; challenges that can be complex and often unexpected, but that are always interesting, rewarding, and fun to solve as a team. This is where you come in. We are on the hunt for the right kind of people to join us and help lead us forward to continued growth.

We have a newly created Data Team that is capturing data, analyzing it, harvesting it, modeling it to provide meaningful insights to our Members and to our businesses. We’re looking for a top performing Data Analyst to join this team, which will be the backbone of all the businesses (based in downtown Toronto but also open to remote candidates)! Reporting to the Head of Data, the Data Analyst is a critical member of Ratehub’s team who will drive decision making across the company. You will work on high impact projects with business stakeholders and will need to use data to solve long-term and immediate business problems. The role will involve data analysis, modeling and insights development. The ideal candidate has strong communications skills, a passion for data, a background in quantitative analysis and an interest in personal finance. You will get the opportunity to work closely with the other analysts in the team as well as the business stakeholders to learn different parts of the business and provide valuable support with data reporting and analysis across various business units.

Your Responsibilities


Drive business strategy by engaging with key stakeholders to understand the business vision, requirements & priorities and help to translate this into actionable insights
Analyze data to drive meaningful insights on consumer behavior, consumer’s financial needs, attitudes, pricing, revenue management, modeling and AI
Model, build, and maintain scorecards for different parts of the business using our BI tool
Collaborate with the other analysts to support product, marketing, sales and finance teams with ad hoc analysis and reporting
Support in developing and maintaining our data model by understanding key data sources and relationships between them


Your Qualifications


1-2 years’ of relevant work experience at an internet / ecommerce company (including co-ops and internships) required
Post-secondary degree: We value intelligence over relevance, but a Bachelors in Computer Science would be looked upon favorably
High proficiency with SQL for data analysis
Some knowledge of BI & reporting tools e.g. Looker, Tableau, Sisense, QlikView
Knowledge of Python or R is considered an asset
Experience with a web analytics tool to support product and marketing analysis will be an asset
Exposure to cloud infrastructure such as AWS, Azure or GCP is nice to have


BEYOND THE TECHNICAL YOU ARE:


Strong Analytical Skills
Detail oriented: High standard of data quality and integrity
Resourceful: You don’t have all the answers, but you know how to get them
Strong problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities
Adaptable to a fast paced environment and able to pivot quickly to align with changing priorities


CULTURE FIT:


No Ego: No task is too big or small. You are never afraid to ask questions when you are trying to learn and understand things. You have no problem rolling up your sleeves and helping to execute when the team needs help. This humility extends to all aspects of your work and interaction with teammates
Player Coach: You mentor and teach as you execute. You model the behaviour you expect from your team. You don’t just tell others what to do, you know and show how to do it at a high standard
Growth mindset: You have a desire to always continue to grow and learn. This means a willingness to get outside your comfort zone and try new things because you view these as opportunities to gain skills and knowledge
Helping Hand: You always offer to help without having to be asked. You go the extra mile to help out regardless of your team and function
Get S##T Done: Your bias is towards action. This means pitching in and rallying to get things across the finish line. Rather than putting off work ask yourself what you can do today to move the needle on a project or goal
Digs Deep: You aren't afraid to ask questions because you want to understand every issue so that you can properly solve the root cause of the problem instead of just completing the task you are given


JOB PERKS:


Competitive salary: We know life is expensive
Flexible hours: Enjoy a couple more hours of sleep in the morning, if you want
Benefits: Health is wealth! A benefits package with no employee contribution required
Perks: RRSP matching program, individual training allowance, access to financial literacy training and resources
Casual dress code: If it’s good enough for you, it’s good enough for us
Fun team socials


Ratehub welcomes and encourages applications from people with disabilities. Accommodations are available upon request for candidates taking part in all aspects of the selection process.
