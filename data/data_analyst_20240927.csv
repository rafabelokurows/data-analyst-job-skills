This means that we don’t focus on a specific tool for a problem, but instead surgically define the problem before determining if we need to implement a data strategy, BI solution, machine learning model, or perhaps transform the client’s data architecture.

About The Job

Do you want to work for a highly successful, fast expanding international retailer with many growth opportunities? At Action we offer you the opportunity to become part of our newly created Strategy and Analytics team as Data Analyst and play an important role in supporting the overall growth of Action.

This is your daily action

The Data Analyst is part of the Business Development Team and reports to the Head of Business Development. Together with senior executives, the Strategy and Analytics team works on key topics for Action such as: Sustainability, Digitization, Expansion, Supply Chain and more. Together with your team members you support in driving data-driven decision-making across the organization.

Your work field is very dynamic, but in general involves tasks such as:


Build deep insights and analysis regarding the dynamic and competitive landscape in which we operate.
Work with our internal data and external market data to discover insights, converting these into tangible business recommendations that support our strategy.
Lead and participate in strategic projects, in close collaboration with your colleagues from the Strategy and Analytics Team and the Action team at large.
Support operational departments in root cause analyses and understanding performance issues


Your work location will be our International Head Office in Zwaagdijk (a 30 minutes traffic free drive from Amsterdam).

This is you

What you bring:


Strong analytical and problem-solving abilities.
Proficiency in data analysis tools such as SQL, Python, R, and data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, or similar.
Familiarity with retail analytics, including sales forecasting, inventory, and customer behavior analysis.
Excellent communication and presentation skills.
Minimum of 2-3 years of experience in data analysis or a related field.
Bachelor’s degree in Data Science, Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Economics, or a related field.


What we offer

Surprisingly much! From our international headquarters in the Netherlands you have an impact on what happens in our stores across Europe. We welcome more than 15 million customers every week in more than 2,600 stores in 12 European countries. We have great growth ambitions. For Action and for you. Because our growth means that you can always take new steps. A different position, an interesting innovation project, new skills: you can continue to develop as a professional. And all this in a culture where our shared values are truly lived: customer focus, teamwork, simplicity, discipline, cost conscious and respect

Did you know that you can also count on us for:


A competitive salary based on a 38-hour working week
24 paid vacation days with the option of purchasing 5 extra days (based on 38 hours per week).
A temporary contract with the intention of offering you a permanent contract in the long term
Flexible working hours
15% employee discount on your purchases at Action
A good pension scheme and collective health insurance


How we contribute to society

If you only know Action from the stores, a world will open up for you when you come and work with us. We work hard to make a positive impact on society and the environment. Did you know, for example, that we sponsor more than 2,500 children worldwide who grow up in an SOS Children's Village? That our team reflects the diversity of our customers, including 155 different nationalities? That we purchase 94% of our wood products and 100% of our cotton sustainably? And that almost all our stores only use energy-efficient LED lighting? Yes, that is also Action. Curious about what other initiatives we’re facilitating? Join our team and find out for yourself.

Interested?

Take action and apply now!

The next steps


Our recruiter will review your application and get back to you as soon as possible.
We invite you for a first job interview.
We would like to get to know you better, which is why we ask you to take an online assessment.
We will invite you for a second interview and we will discuss your assessment.
Are we still a great match? Then we will become new colleagues!


At Action, integrity is of great importance to us. A pre-employment screening is therefore part of the application process for this vacancy. Contact your recruiter for more information.

Interesserer du dig for at sætte data og indsigter i spil med henblik på at optimere og understøtte en forretning, og vil du gøre det i tæt dialog med interessenter på tværs af forretning og i ledelse? Og har du lyst til at arbejde med front-end Power BI opgaver og back-end MS Azure opgaver, direkte og gennem eksterne leverandører? Så skal du læse videre.




Du bliver Moove Groups ’go-to-person’ inden for BI & Data og rapporterer direkte til chefen for IT & Digital. Når du ønsker dyb faglig sparring, så har du dygtige kollegaer i IT samt erfarne BI specialister eksternt hos forskellige leverandører, så du bliver derfor godt understøttet og har muligheden for faglig og teknisk udvikling.




Om jobbet

Moove Group har et stort potentiale for at bruge data som grundlag for beslutninger og styring af deres drift. Der er en transformation i gang mhp. at skifte centrale IT-systemer, hvilket åbner op for at optimere og tilpasse datastrukturer og governance, og her spiller du en vigtig rolle i relation til at definere fremtidens måde at arbejde med data.




Dit arbejde foregår i spændingsfeltet mellem data og forretning, og hvor du leverer ’end-to-end’ Power BI-løsninger. Udover selv at lave front-end løsninger, så er du også opgavestiller og kontakt til eksterne samarbejdspartnere, som bidrager til datadrevne beslutninger på tværs af Moove Group. Dine primære arbejdsopgaver inkluderer:




Opbygge, vedligeholde og optimere Power BI-rapporter for at understøtte datadrevne beslutninger i organisationen.
Samarbejde med interne og eksterne interessenter for at forstå deres behov, og hvordan de bedst kan opfyldes gennem diverse løsninger.
Bidrage til data governance og kvalitetssikring af valide data.
Drive forankring og brug af rapporter i organisationen.
Yde support til og træne Power BI-brugere samt understøtte ledelsen i deres forretningsindsigt og beslutninger.




Om profilen

Vi leder efter dig, der både trives med at udvikle front-end løsninger i Power BI og kan arbejde med back-end løsninger i MS Azure og Moove Groups on-prem data warehouse – og som kan arbejde både selvstændigt og i samarbejde med eksterne leverandører.




Vi forestiller os, at du har en akademisk baggrund inden for IT eller tilsvarende. Det betyder knap så meget, om du er nyuddannet eller har 3-5 års erfaring – opgaverne kan skræddersyes til at passe til dit erfaringsniveau og ambitioner. Det vigtigste er, at du har indgående kendskab til Power BI og gerne har haft berøring med MS Azure.




Som person er du nysgerrig, initiativrig og handlingsorienteret. Du trives med en dynamisk hverdag, hvor opgaverne er forskellige, men hvor de alle bliver løst med højt engagement og kvalitet. Det fordrer derfor også, at du er proaktiv, selvmotiverende, selvstændig og er god til at prioritere og planlægge dine opgaver.




Hvorfor du skal vælge Moove Group

Moove Group er en engageret, uformel og tillidsbaseret arbejdsplads, som er præget af fokus på at skabe værdi for forretningen. Du bliver del af et godt team, der står for en bred vifte af opgaver indenfor udvikling, drift og support, hvor de hver dag tænker kreativt og løsningsorienteret i udviklingen af det fremtidige IT-landskab – og der er fokus på at have det sjovt sammen undervejs.




Mange af medarbejderne synes også, at det er ekstra motiverende, at der i disse år investeres i nye innovative systemer, som understøtter automatisering, digitalisering og optimering af forretningen og biler og bussers driftssystemer.




Arbejdsstedet bliver i nye lokaler tæt ved Bagsværd station, hvor der altid er friskbrygget kaffe, en lækker frokostordning og et godt socialt miljø, der byder på alt fra fredagsbar til kunstklub. Og vigtigst af alt… en masse sjove, søde og dygtige kollegaer.

          <p>Vil du arbejde i Danmarks førende mobilitetsvirksomhed med HB Care og Dantaxi som to stærke brands, og hvor datadrevne beslutninger er i fokus og skal være fundamentet for al forretning? Interesserer du dig for at sætte data og indsigter i spil med henblik på at optimere og understøtte en forretning, og vil du gøre det i tæt dialog med interessenter på tværs af forretning og i ledelse? Og har du lyst til at arbejde med front-end Power BI opgaver og back-end MS Azure opgaver, direkte og gennem eksterne leverandører? Så skal du læse videre.</p><p><br></p><p>Du bliver Moove Groups ’go-to-person’ inden for BI &amp; Data og rapporterer direkte til chefen for IT &amp; Digital. Når du ønsker dyb faglig sparring, så har du dygtige kollegaer i IT samt erfarne BI specialister eksternt hos forskellige leverandører, så du bliver derfor godt understøttet og har muligheden for faglig og teknisk udvikling.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Om jobbet</strong></p><p>Moove Group har et stort potentiale for at bruge data som grundlag for beslutninger og styring af deres drift. Der er en transformation i gang mhp. at skifte centrale IT-systemer, hvilket åbner op for at optimere og tilpasse datastrukturer og governance, og her spiller du en vigtig rolle i relation til at definere fremtidens måde at arbejde med data.</p><p><br></p><p>Dit arbejde foregår i spændingsfeltet mellem data og forretning, og hvor du leverer ’end-to-end’ Power BI-løsninger. Udover selv at lave front-end løsninger, så er du også opgavestiller og kontakt til eksterne samarbejdspartnere, som bidrager til datadrevne beslutninger på tværs af Moove Group. Dine primære arbejdsopgaver inkluderer:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Opbygge, vedligeholde og optimere Power BI-rapporter for at understøtte datadrevne beslutninger i organisationen.</li><li>Samarbejde med interne og eksterne interessenter for at forstå deres behov, og hvordan de bedst kan opfyldes gennem diverse løsninger.</li><li>Bidrage til data governance og kvalitetssikring af valide data.</li><li>Drive forankring og brug af rapporter i organisationen.</li><li>Yde support til og træne Power BI-brugere samt understøtte ledelsen i deres forretningsindsigt og beslutninger.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Om profilen</strong></p><p>Vi leder efter dig, der både trives med at udvikle front-end løsninger i Power BI og kan arbejde med back-end løsninger i MS Azure og Moove Groups on-prem data warehouse – og som kan arbejde både selvstændigt og i samarbejde med eksterne leverandører.</p><p><br></p><p>Vi forestiller os, at du har en akademisk baggrund inden for IT eller tilsvarende. Det betyder knap så meget, om du er nyuddannet eller har 3-5 års erfaring – opgaverne kan skræddersyes til at passe til dit erfaringsniveau og ambitioner. Det vigtigste er, at du har indgående kendskab til Power BI og gerne har haft berøring med MS Azure.</p><p><br></p><p>Som person er du nysgerrig, initiativrig og handlingsorienteret. Du trives med en dynamisk hverdag, hvor opgaverne er forskellige, men hvor de alle bliver løst med højt engagement og kvalitet. Det fordrer derfor også, at du er proaktiv, selvmotiverende, selvstændig og er god til at prioritere og planlægge dine opgaver.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Hvorfor du skal vælge Moove Group</strong></p><p>Moove Group er en engageret, uformel og tillidsbaseret arbejdsplads, som er præget af fokus på at skabe værdi for forretningen.

Chris's everyday life at Accenture

I studied physics and mathematics and delved into quantum machine learning during my master's. Since I finished my studies in 2022, I have worked at Accenture as a data engineer in the Data&AI department. In my role as backend developer on a significant data platform project for one of our larger clients, I have mainly focused on backend development. I have also had the pleasure of exploring other areas such as front-end development and work with software release strategies, as well as CI/CD automation. This has given me a wide range of skills and experiences in various aspects of software development.

I am actively involved in our vibrant Data&AI community. We regularly organize presentations and invite external speakers to keep us up to date on the latest trends and innovations in the field. In addition, I take regular artificial intelligences and data-related courses to keep up to date with the ever-developing professional landscape. For me, the social aspect is just as important as the academic aspect. Fortunately, this is a group where well-being and togetherness are the focus. We see each other as friends as well as colleagues, and together we organize everything from social events to professional gatherings.

Aurora’s everyday life at Accenture

I have worked as a data engineer in Data&AI since 2022, after studying Computer Science and Engineering at DTU. At university, I immersed myself in various machine learning subjects, and finally ended up with a master's on predicting ship activity in the (partly untouched) Arctic. The combination of data analysis and ML algorithms added flavor, and luckily I get the opportunity to continue exploring this field here at Accenture, with fantastically talented and good colleagues!

I have previously worked on the same project as Chris as data engineer for a large digital transformation, where we use a number of technologies and frameworks for end-to-end development. I am currently on a smaller project working on developing a Generative AI solution through OpenAI. It is incredibly exciting and meaningful to apply today's technology to well-established processes at well-known players. GenAI is a hot topic, which is shown through great commitment to the project within Accenture and at the customer.

In addition to project work, I help lead Accenture's female mentorship program for university students. So there is a lot of variety that you can get involved in, while at the same time you have your belonging in our exotic Data & AI community. Here we are friends and colleagues with the same interests, although there is great variation in the number of years of experience and types of projects, which creates a fantastic starting point to learn from each other. Good atmosphere, low shoulders and commitment!

Does this sound interesting?

Then we would like to hear from you! Paradoxically, we prefer application letters not written by ChatGPT.

Som vores nye Web Analytics Specialist bliver du en integreret del af et højt kvalificeret team og får bl.a. ansvaret for at omsætte data til konkrete og værdiskabende initiativer – alt sammen med henblik på at sikre vores kunder får en sublim digital kundeoplevelse. Interesseret?

”Som Web Analytics Specialist er du med til at sikre, at vi hos Telenor løfter os fra datafundament til aktivering af data. Du bliver en central del af vores dygtige og dedikerede ecommerce-team, der dagligt arbejder for at sikre Telenor’s position på markedet, som teleselskabet der sætter kunden først” – Thomas Hermann, Head of Ecommerce

Du sikrer en sublim digital kundeoplevelse for Danmarks gladeste kunder

Som Web Analytics Specialist er du organisatorisk placeret i vores Market & Customers division. Her bliver du en del af vores ecommerce-team, hvis fornemmeste opgave er at sikre, at vi til enhver tid har nogle velsmurte webshops og skarpe selvbetjeningsmiljøer, som både skaber en sublim kundeoplevelse og en høj konverteringsrate.

I denne rolle får du mulighed for at udfolde dine analytiske evner til fulde idet du får mulighed for at fordybe dig i data og ecommerce. Du vil arbejde med komplekse datasæt, som du visualiserer og omsætter til indsigter, der leder til konkrete værdiskabende initiativer samtidig med, at du styrker dit kommercielle mindset.

Vi er på en rejse fra at have skabt et godt datagrundlag, til at bruge det bedre til rapportering, indsigter og aktivering på vores digitale platforme og her vil du spille en meget central rolle. I Telenor arbejder vi agilt i både specialiserede teams og tværfaglige value streams. I denne rolle, vil du primært blive en del af vores ecommerce team, men fra tid til anden vil du også indgå i vores tværfaglige value streams som enabler, når dine kompetencer efterspørges.

I denne rolle vil dine primære arbejdsopgaver være centreret omkring at:


Udforske og forstå vores data med en nysgerrig tilgang, og omsætte indsigterne til konkrete, værdiskabende initiativer, såsom konverteringsoptimerende tiltag, herunder automation og personalisering;
Deltage i overvejelser omkring marketing stack, identity resolution (f.eks. user id), first party data, integration, samtykkehåndtering og privatliv m.v.;
Beslutte, dokumentere, implementere, teste og validere tracking på tværs af web og apps, samt sikre en ensartet, skalerbar opsætning på tværs af brands;
Implementere og opdatere marketing tracking (Facebook Pixel, Google Ads etc.), samt UX- og CRO-værktøjer; og
Opsætte, optimere og vedligeholde interaktive dashboards til monitorering af KPI’er via Looker Studio og Power BI.


Du har blik for det digitale og kommercielle i en teknisk verden

I denne rolle får du mulighed for at udnytte din erfaring inden for dataanalyse og performance tracking til at gøre en reel forskel. Du arbejder individuelt, men får samtidig mulighed for at samarbejde tæt med relevante interessenter og blive en værdsat sparringspartner takket være din evne til at kommunikere klart og dit smittende gode humør.

Din høje faglighed giver dig mulighed for at sætte retning, tage ansvar og træffe vigtige beslutninger, mens du sikrer, at dine opgaver bliver eksekveret og afsluttet til tiden. Med din strukturerede tilgang vil du kunne løse opgaver effektivt og skabe værdi for teamet såvel som resten af organisationen.

Derudover forestiller vi os, at du:


Er initiativrig og tager styring for at maksimere værdien af data;
Har erfaring med web analytics og tracking, især i GA4;
Er dygtig til implementering, f.eks. via Google Tag Manager (dette foregår i tæt samarbejde med udviklere);
Har solide færdigheder inden for Power BI, Looker Studio, og datavisualisering; og
Har erfaring med ecommerce eller har kendskab til områder som CDP, Adobe Analytics, SQL osv.


Sidstnævnte er en fordel, men ikke et krav. Vi håber mest af alt, at du har et kæmpe drive for at lykkes med det, du sætter dig for og deler vores ønske om at skabe sublime digitale kundeoplevelser.

En arbejdsplads fyldt med Fantastiske forbindelser

Du bliver en del af en foranderlig organisation, hvor der, på tværs af forretningen, venter dedikerede og dygtige kolleger, som kontinuerligt arbejder for at udvikle fremtidens teleselskab. Vi arbejder agilt, fokuserer indsatsområder ved hjælp af Kanban og praktiserer Tight-Loose-Tight som ledelsesfilosofi. Med de nyeste løsninger og det mest effektive netværk skaber vi små mirakler i en verden, der aldrig står stille.

Du kan læse mere om os her .

I foråret foretog vi en sammenlægning af Telenor og CBB. Ved at bygge på det bedste fra vores to verdener og samle vores kompetencer, mener vi, at vi kan blive skarpere på måden at arbejde med produkter, kundeoplevelse og udvikling på. Således vil du i denne rolle arbejde med begge brands i én stærk fælles organisation, som har et fælles fokus på kundeoplevelser, produktudvikling og marked.

Interesseret?

Har du spørgsmål eller vil du vide mere om stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte Head of Ecommerce, Thomas Hermann, via kontaktoplysningerne til højre.

Kan du se dig selv i rollen og har du interesse i at blive en Fantastisk forbindelse søger du blot stillingen via linket øverst her på siden. Du behøver ikke skrive en ansøgning, men vi ser meget gerne et CV fra dig. Derudover har du mulighed for at sætte et par ord på dig selv gennem vores ansøgningsskema. 

Vi ser frem til at høre fra dig senest d. 29. september, men gerne før, da vi holder samtaler løbende.

The job as Data Engineer

You will be a part of our great Intraday power team working with highly ambitious and qualified quantitative analysts, machine-learning experts, tool and system developers, and traders, which means you’ll be as close to the action as you can be.

This role gives you the chance to dive deep into the exciting power domain, and your work will be critical in unifying our data agenda and supporting both in-house and third-party data needs.




It will be a requirement to be proactive and be able to work autonomously as your collaborators will know ""the what"" but expect you to figure out ""the how"". In doing so, you will have the mandate to shape the solution using our existing setup or possibly introducing new tech. Expect that the results you deliver will be used within the day and that your impact will be recognized.




Your key responsibilities

Design and implement data pipelines for efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
Manage the central databases, ensuring data is validated, cleaned, and monitored.
Collaborate with quantitative analysts, platform engineers, and traders to meet their data needs.
Help enforce best practices for data management, including schema design and data governance.
Optimize data storage solutions to balance performance, cost, and scalability – this will be done with data engineers from our central team as well.




Your core skills

Proficiency in Python.
Experience with database management.
Strong understanding of data modeling and ETL processes.
Familiarity with orchestration and data pipeline tools such as Prefect, Apache Airflow, or similar.
Experience with Azure services such as Azure Functions and Azure Data Explorer or similar cloud services.
Strong analytical skills and an eye for detail.




Beneficial skills

Experience with SQL and KQL.
Familiarity with containerization tools (e.g., Docker).
Experience with or interest in big data technologies (Spark, Databricks).




Your qualifications

Relevant experience in data engineering or a related field.
MSc or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Engineering, Business intelligence, Economy, or a related discipline.




Working in MFT Energy

You will be part of a young, global, and vibrant working environment in the heart of Aarhus. MFT Energy is a transparent and flat organization with entrepreneurship at heart. We are 163 employees working out of our headquarters in Scandinavian Center in Aarhus C and from our international offices in Turkey, Australia, Austin, Singapore, and several remote colleagues working from all over the world.

We offer:

We are looking for more AI enthusiasts like Chris and Aurora, with similar ambitions and courage to become part of our active and forward-looking professional environment. In this professional environment, we work with the latest technology in AI and Cloud, organize workshops internally and in customer projects, support technology sales and develop high-quality solutions for our customers.

Chris's everyday life at Accenture

I studied physics and mathematics and delved into quantum machine learning during my master's. Since I finished my studies in 2022, I have worked at Accenture as a data engineer in the Data&AI department. In my role as backend developer on a significant data platform project for one of our larger clients, I have mainly focused on backend development. I have also had the pleasure of exploring other areas such as front-end development and work with software release strategies, as well as CI/CD automation. This has given me a wide range of skills and experiences in various aspects of software development.

I am actively involved in our vibrant Data&AI community. We regularly organize presentations and invite external speakers to keep us up to date on the latest trends and innovations in the field. In addition, I take regular artificial intelligences and data-related courses to keep up to date with the ever-developing professional landscape. For me, the social aspect is just as important as the academic aspect. Fortunately, this is a group where well-being and togetherness are the focus. We see each other as friends as well as colleagues, and together we organize everything from social events to professional gatherings.

Aurora’s everyday life at Accenture

I have worked as a data engineer in Data&AI since 2022, after studying Computer Science and Engineering at DTU. At university, I immersed myself in various machine learning subjects, and finally ended up with a master's on predicting ship activity in the (partly untouched) Arctic. The combination of data analysis and ML algorithms added flavor, and luckily I get the opportunity to continue exploring this field here at Accenture, with fantastically talented and good colleagues!

I have previously worked on the same project as Chris as data engineer for a large digital transformation, where we use a number of technologies and frameworks for end-to-end development. I am currently on a smaller project working on developing a Generative AI solution through OpenAI. It is incredibly exciting and meaningful to apply today's technology to well-established processes at well-known players. GenAI is a hot topic, which is shown through great commitment to the project within Accenture and at the customer.

In addition to project work, I help lead Accenture's female mentorship program for university students. So there is a lot of variety that you can get involved in, while at the same time you have your belonging in our exotic Data & AI community. Here we are friends and colleagues with the same interests, although there is great variation in the number of years of experience and types of projects, which creates a fantastic starting point to learn from each other. Good atmosphere, low shoulders and commitment!

Does this sound interesting?

Then we would like to hear from you! Paradoxically, we prefer application letters not written by ChatGPT.

Som vores nye Web Analytics Specialist bliver du en integreret del af et højt kvalificeret team og får bl.a. ansvaret for at omsætte data til konkrete og værdiskabende initiativer – alt sammen med henblik på at sikre vores kunder får en sublim digital kundeoplevelse. Interesseret?

”Som Web Analytics Specialist er du med til at sikre, at vi hos Telenor løfter os fra datafundament til aktivering af data. Du bliver en central del af vores dygtige og dedikerede ecommerce-team, der dagligt arbejder for at sikre Telenor’s position på markedet, som teleselskabet der sætter kunden først” – Thomas Hermann, Head of Ecommerce

Du sikrer en sublim digital kundeoplevelse for Danmarks gladeste kunder

Som Web Analytics Specialist er du organisatorisk placeret i vores Market & Customers division. Her bliver du en del af vores ecommerce-team, hvis fornemmeste opgave er at sikre, at vi til enhver tid har nogle velsmurte webshops og skarpe selvbetjeningsmiljøer, som både skaber en sublim kundeoplevelse og en høj konverteringsrate.

I denne rolle får du mulighed for at udfolde dine analytiske evner til fulde idet du får mulighed for at fordybe dig i data og ecommerce. Du vil arbejde med komplekse datasæt, som du visualiserer og omsætter til indsigter, der leder til konkrete værdiskabende initiativer samtidig med, at du styrker dit kommercielle mindset.

Vi er på en rejse fra at have skabt et godt datagrundlag, til at bruge det bedre til rapportering, indsigter og aktivering på vores digitale platforme og her vil du spille en meget central rolle. I Telenor arbejder vi agilt i både specialiserede teams og tværfaglige value streams. I denne rolle, vil du primært blive en del af vores ecommerce team, men fra tid til anden vil du også indgå i vores tværfaglige value streams som enabler, når dine kompetencer efterspørges.

I denne rolle vil dine primære arbejdsopgaver være centreret omkring at:


Udforske og forstå vores data med en nysgerrig tilgang, og omsætte indsigterne til konkrete, værdiskabende initiativer, såsom konverteringsoptimerende tiltag, herunder automation og personalisering;
Deltage i overvejelser omkring marketing stack, identity resolution (f.eks. user id), first party data, integration, samtykkehåndtering og privatliv m.v.;
Beslutte, dokumentere, implementere, teste og validere tracking på tværs af web og apps, samt sikre en ensartet, skalerbar opsætning på tværs af brands;
Implementere og opdatere marketing tracking (Facebook Pixel, Google Ads etc.), samt UX- og CRO-værktøjer; og
Opsætte, optimere og vedligeholde interaktive dashboards til monitorering af KPI’er via Looker Studio og Power BI.


Du har blik for det digitale og kommercielle i en teknisk verden

I denne rolle får du mulighed for at udnytte din erfaring inden for dataanalyse og performance tracking til at gøre en reel forskel. Du arbejder individuelt, men får samtidig mulighed for at samarbejde tæt med relevante interessenter og blive en værdsat sparringspartner takket være din evne til at kommunikere klart og dit smittende gode humør.

Din høje faglighed giver dig mulighed for at sætte retning, tage ansvar og træffe vigtige beslutninger, mens du sikrer, at dine opgaver bliver eksekveret og afsluttet til tiden. Med din strukturerede tilgang vil du kunne løse opgaver effektivt og skabe værdi for teamet såvel som resten af organisationen.

Derudover forestiller vi os, at du:


Er initiativrig og tager styring for at maksimere værdien af data;
Har erfaring med web analytics og tracking, især i GA4;
Er dygtig til implementering, f.eks. via Google Tag Manager (dette foregår i tæt samarbejde med udviklere);
Har solide færdigheder inden for Power BI, Looker Studio, og datavisualisering; og
Har erfaring med ecommerce eller har kendskab til områder som CDP, Adobe Analytics, SQL osv.


Sidstnævnte er en fordel, men ikke et krav. Vi håber mest af alt, at du har et kæmpe drive for at lykkes med det, du sætter dig for og deler vores ønske om at skabe sublime digitale kundeoplevelser.

En arbejdsplads fyldt med Fantastiske forbindelser

Du bliver en del af en foranderlig organisation, hvor der, på tværs af forretningen, venter dedikerede og dygtige kolleger, som kontinuerligt arbejder for at udvikle fremtidens teleselskab. Vi arbejder agilt, fokuserer indsatsområder ved hjælp af Kanban og praktiserer Tight-Loose-Tight som ledelsesfilosofi. Med de nyeste løsninger og det mest effektive netværk skaber vi små mirakler i en verden, der aldrig står stille.

Du kan læse mere om os her .

I foråret foretog vi en sammenlægning af Telenor og CBB. Ved at bygge på det bedste fra vores to verdener og samle vores kompetencer, mener vi, at vi kan blive skarpere på måden at arbejde med produkter, kundeoplevelse og udvikling på. Således vil du i denne rolle arbejde med begge brands i én stærk fælles organisation, som har et fælles fokus på kundeoplevelser, produktudvikling og marked.

Interesseret?

Har du spørgsmål eller vil du vide mere om stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte Head of Ecommerce, Thomas Hermann, via kontaktoplysningerne til højre.

Kan du se dig selv i rollen og har du interesse i at blive en Fantastisk forbindelse søger du blot stillingen via linket øverst her på siden. Du behøver ikke skrive en ansøgning, men vi ser meget gerne et CV fra dig. Derudover har du mulighed for at sætte et par ord på dig selv gennem vores ansøgningsskema. 

Vi ser frem til at høre fra dig senest d. 29. september, men gerne før, da vi holder samtaler løbende.

At Subsets, we are developing the future of AI-driven Retention Automation for subscription media companies.

We are building Subsets to rethink this experience and increase subscribers' lifetime.

We are a small team backed by leading VCs, such as Y Combinator, and our customers include some of the largest subscription businesses in the world, such as Daily Mail (UK) and The Athletic (US). As a data engineer at Subsets, you will work directly with our customers' data and have the opportunity to shape and impact the product experience.

In this role, you will


Work directly with the founding team and our software engineers.
Design, develop, and manage our scalable data pipelines and ETL processes.
Monitor and optimize our data pipelines (we are moving a lot of data!).
Work in a small, high-performing team where you will influence the product.
Keep up with the latest developments in the space and see how they can be applied.


You may be a good fit if you have


A background in data engineering.
Hands-on experience in SQL, dbt and BigQuery, postgreSQL, or similar.
Have prior experience building ETL pipelines.
Experience working with Google Cloud Platform, AWS, or similar.
Experience working with Docker, Terraform, Python, or similar technologies.
The ability to work effectively in a startup environment where things change fast and are sometimes loosely defined.
This is neither an exhaustive nor necessary list of attributes. If none of these apply to you, but you believe you can contribute to Subsets, please reach out.


Benefits


Competitive salary
A stake in Subsets' success (equity)
A flexible work environment with frequent social activities
Great Lunch (and breakfast)


Applying


Send your resume and LinkedIn profile.
Typically, we will meet three times: 1) for an introductory coffee in our CPH office, 2) for an in-depth technical interview, and 3) to discuss our offer.
Note: Subsets does not accept fully remote applications. We value flexibility but prioritize working together from our Copenhagen office most of the time.
