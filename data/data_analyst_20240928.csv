By effectively turning our research into ground-breaking treatments, we help make medicine more accessible and open up more possibilities for patients and more opportunities for those caring for them. This has been our approach since day one, but we know we can’t change the world of rare diseases on our own.

Together, we define how our business can create solutions that serve the needs of those affected by rare diseases while facilitating sustainable growth.

Our legacy is rooted in innovation and excellence, earning us a spot on Fast Company’s esteemed annual list of the World’s Most Innovative Companies, as well as recognition as one of U.S. News & World Report’s Best Companies to Work For in 2024. Discover endless opportunities to grow and make your mark at Hines.

 

The Data & Analytics team is responsible for transforming the data generated through Hines’s regular course of business into strategic insights for investment. The Senior Analyst will perform the integral role of designing systems, both technical and operational, to capture this data as it is generated. Since the decisions made during the data capture phase affect all subsequent reports and analysis, this role has the potential for tremendous impact to the firm.

 

As a first project, the Senior Analyst will be focused on improving Hines’ approach to collecting tenant company information, i.e. “Who does Hines lease its spaces to?” Technically, this project will involve working with company-level data from a third-party API, structuring that data for reporting, and querying that data for reporting and analysis. Operationally, this project will involve learning the life-cycle of a lease, understanding company legal structures, developing best practices for data entry, educating users on those best practices, and adapting those best practices to their feedback.

 

This is an exciting position at the crossroads of business and computer science with lots of room to grow. If you have a passion for problem solving and systems building, we welcome you to apply!

 

Meet with firm leadership and end users to document current data generation, flows, uses, and needs.
Identify procedural inefficiencies; develop or source software to automate and improve workflows.
Work with Hines team members to understand the business of real estate deeply enough to distill it down into data.

 

Minimum Requirements include:

 

Bachelor’s degree in computer science, engineering, math, finance, or another quantitative field from an accredited institution is strongly preferred.

Two or more years in an analyst or data science role.

Experience in commercial real estate, investment management, or public accounting is a plus, but not required.

Meet with firm leadership and end users to document current data generation, flows, uses, and needs.

Identify procedural inefficiencies; develop or source software to automate and improve workflows.

Work with Hines team members to understand the business of real estate deeply enough to distill it down into data.

Hands-on database experience is required. The candidate must be able to demonstrate a working knowledge of SQL and data management.

The candidate must have a high degree of proficiency in Microsoft Excel and VBA, or have enough experience in one of the following programming languages to pick up VBA quickly: Python, Java, R, C/C++.

Unwavering commitment to integrity, the firm’s Guiding Principles, and our Leadership Principles.

Ability to lift files, records, and computer paper (approximately 5-10 lbs.)

Ability to operate a computer, phone system and general office equipment.

Work over 40 hours per week as business needs deem appropriate.

Conduct cross-channel analysis of marketing campaigns to identify how social, email, and web interactions drive podcast engagement and listener behavior.

Implement UTM tracking systems and develop sophisticated attribution models to accurately measure cross-platform influence on podcast behavior.


Collaboration & Stakeholder Support:


Collaborate with the Head of Marketing and team leads across email, social, and podcast to ensure insights align with business objectives and help optimize performance.
Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on data that help guide marketing strategy, improve campaign performance, and boost audience engagement.


Infrastructure & Process Development:

Play a key role in building a scalable data framework, potentially including a data warehouse with business intelligence layers to support complex, multi-channel reporting.


Qualifications:


4-6+ years of experience in marketing data analysis, with a strong focus on cross-platform campaign performance and KPI reporting.
Proficiency in data analysis tools such as Tableau, Excel, and Google Analytics, with experience using podcast platforms (e.g., Simplecast, Chartable, Spotify, Apple Podcast), web (GA4), email (Customer.io), and social media analytics (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok).
Proven ability to manage and interpret complex data sets, delivering clear insights in a fast-paced environment.
Experience in implementing UTM tracking and attribution reporting across multiple channels.
Strong data visualization skills with experience in creating dashboards that communicate data insights effectively.

Our legacy is rooted in innovation and excellence, earning us a spot on Fast Company’s esteemed annual list of the World’s Most Innovative Companies, as well as recognition as one of U.S. News & World Report’s Best Companies to Work For in 2024. Discover endless opportunities to grow and make your mark at Hines.

 

The Data & Analytics team is responsible for transforming the data generated through Hines’s regular course of business into strategic insights for investment. The Senior Analyst will perform the integral role of designing systems, both technical and operational, to capture this data as it is generated. Since the decisions made during the data capture phase affect all subsequent reports and analysis, this role has the potential for tremendous impact to the firm.

 

As a first project, the Senior Analyst will be focused on improving Hines’ approach to collecting tenant company information, i.e. “Who does Hines lease its spaces to?” Technically, this project will involve working with company-level data from a third-party API, structuring that data for reporting, and querying that data for reporting and analysis. Operationally, this project will involve learning the life-cycle of a lease, understanding company legal structures, developing best practices for data entry, educating users on those best practices, and adapting those best practices to their feedback.

 

This is an exciting position at the crossroads of business and computer science with lots of room to grow. If you have a passion for problem solving and systems building, we welcome you to apply!

 

Meet with firm leadership and end users to document current data generation, flows, uses, and needs.
Identify procedural inefficiencies; develop or source software to automate and improve workflows.
Work with Hines team members to understand the business of real estate deeply enough to distill it down into data.

 

Minimum Requirements include:

 

Bachelor’s degree in computer science, engineering, math, finance, or another quantitative field from an accredited institution is strongly preferred.

Two or more years in an analyst or data science role.

Experience in commercial real estate, investment management, or public accounting is a plus, but not required.

Meet with firm leadership and end users to document current data generation, flows, uses, and needs.

Identify procedural inefficiencies; develop or source software to automate and improve workflows.

Work with Hines team members to understand the business of real estate deeply enough to distill it down into data.

Hands-on database experience is required. The candidate must be able to demonstrate a working knowledge of SQL and data management.

The candidate must have a high degree of proficiency in Microsoft Excel and VBA, or have enough experience in one of the following programming languages to pick up VBA quickly: Python, Java, R, C/C++.

Unwavering commitment to integrity, the firm’s Guiding Principles, and our Leadership Principles.

Ability to lift files, records, and computer paper (approximately 5-10 lbs.)

Ability to operate a computer, phone system and general office equipment.

Work over 40 hours per week as business needs deem appropriate.

143 Studios LLC is a media company headquartered in Boston, MA focused on creating, producing, and publishing first-of-its-kind audio and visual content that inspires and empowers millions of people around the world with unprecedented results: billions of video views, millions of books sold, seven #1 audiobooks, 19 million total followers, and original courses and professional development education for clients like Starbucks, Ulta Beauty, JP Morgan Chase, and Audible. 143 Studios produces content across all platforms for Mel Robbins, the top female voice in the mental health, wellness, and personal development spaces, including The Mel Robbins Podcast, the #1 Education podcast in the world and the 5th most-followed podcast on Apple Podcasts. Millions of people tune into the podcast for science-backed tools, expert resources, and the inspiration to create a better life.

Mel Robbins is seeking a Marketing Data Analyst to play a pivotal role in collecting, analyzing, and reporting data across podcast, social media, email, and web platforms. This role will be instrumental in driving data-informed decisions and optimizing performance across campaigns. You will be responsible for generating both high-level KPI reports and exploratory deep-dive analyses that deliver actionable insights.

This position is ideal for someone with expertise in attribution reporting and UTM tracking, who can analyze cross-platform performance and provide strategic recommendations on how to optimize marketing initiatives.

As part of a fast-growing and unstructured environment, you'll need to be a self-starter with the ability to build and mature an analytics infrastructure from scratch. Over time, you will help evolve our data environment from individual platform reports to integrated cross-channel analytics, potentially building toward a data warehouse and business intelligence framework.

Key Responsibilities:

Data Management & Reporting:


Collect, clean, and merge data from multiple platforms (including podcasts, social media, email, and web), ensuring accuracy and consistency.
Generate regular reports on key performance metrics, providing both high-level overviews and deeper insights into specific trends across all channels.
Build and maintain automated dashboards using tools such as Excel, Tableau or other BI platforms to visualize data and tell compelling stories


Cross-Platform Campaign Analysis:


Conduct cross-channel analysis of marketing campaigns to identify how social, email, and web interactions drive podcast engagement and listener behavior.
Track critical podcast KPIs (downloads, listens, time listened, unique listeners), as well as key social (engagement, shares, new followers), email (opens, clicks), and web metrics.
Implement UTM tracking systems and develop sophisticated attribution models to accurately measure cross-platform influence on podcast behavior.


Collaboration & Stakeholder Support:


Collaborate with the Head of Marketing and team leads across email, social, and podcast to ensure insights align with business objectives and help optimize performance.
Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on data that help guide marketing strategy, improve campaign performance, and boost audience engagement.


Infrastructure & Process Development:


Develop and evolve the company's analytics infrastructure, beginning with local data exports and reports and maturing into integrated reporting systems.
Play a key role in building a scalable data framework, potentially including a data warehouse with business intelligence layers to support complex, multi-channel reporting.


Qualifications:


4-6+ years of experience in marketing data analysis, with a strong focus on cross-platform campaign performance and KPI reporting.
Proficiency in data analysis tools such as Tableau, Excel, and Google Analytics, with experience using podcast platforms (e.g., Simplecast, Chartable, Spotify, Apple Podcast), web (GA4), email (Customer.io), and social media analytics (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok).
Proven ability to manage and interpret complex data sets, delivering clear insights in a fast-paced environment.
Experience in implementing UTM tracking and attribution reporting across multiple channels.
Strong data visualization skills with experience in creating dashboards that communicate data insights effectively.
Bachelor's degree in a related field.
