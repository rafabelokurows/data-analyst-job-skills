Life in Cisco:

The possibilities to create, to build solutions that impact transformational change are endless because change is our constant.

Don’t take our word for it, check out what some of our hires are saying! # wearecisco

Link to Cisco Careers Home

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Our platform empowers millions of buyers and sellers in more than 190 markets around the world. We’re committed to pushing boundaries and leaving our mark as we reinvent the future of ecommerce for enthusiasts.

Our customers are our compass, authenticity thrives, bold ideas are welcome, and everyone can bring their unique selves to work — every day. We're in this together, sustaining the future of our customers, our company, and our planet.

Join a team of passionate thinkers, innovators, and dreamers — and help us connect people and build communities to create economic opportunity for all.

About The Opportunity

eBay Motors is a multi-billion dollar, global portfolio comprising the Parts & Accessories, Business & Industrial, Vehicles, and WHI (a B2B Parts & Accessories marketplace in US) businesses. These categories are not only among the largest on eBay and core to eBay’s strategic future, but also are actively innovating in the market and at eBay!

We are looking to hire an expert analyst, who will support the eBay UK’s Parts & Accessories leadership team and play an instrumental role in accelerating growth for P&A’s UK business. The role will utilise data and business case development to develop strategic insights, while ensuring operational excellence in planning, analytics, reporting, and teamwork across a broad cross-functional team. Our key partners include product, marketing, analytics, finance, operations, monetization, and business development, among many others.

The role demands a dual mentality: both that of a strategic leader—who has a deep understanding of the dynamics of two-sided marketplaces, can break down tough problems into clear frameworks, operate in ambiguity, and possesses strong data intuition—as well as someone who can move quickly and decisively as an embedded operator not afraid to get their hands dirty.

What you will accomplish


Serve as an analytics partner to the UK Parts & Accessories leadership team
Apply strategic, operational, and analytical standard methodologies to extract and present actionable insights on what’s driving business performance
Build and develop key performance indicators and dashboards to track business performance. Responsible for monitoring metrics, identifying and understanding root causes behind the metrics movement, and synthesizing insights to communicate these insights to senior colleagues
Identify and execute against opportunities across the Parts & Accessories landscape that require strategic deep dives
Partner with Category Managers, partners, and sellers to drive key initiatives



What You Will Bring


Strategic problem solver with strong analytical/data science skills to dive into data and identity root causes
High degree of ownership and commitment to results
Self-motivated to find opportunities and challenges in the business
Communicates clearly, effectively, and proactively with strong listening, written, and verbal communication skills
Ambition to grow professionally and willingness to work hard, learn/adapt, and provide feedback both upward and to peer teams



Requirements


2+ years of related experience, ideally at a top-tier management consulting firm, investment bank, or in a strategy & planning role at a major corporation
Excellent analytical skills including familiarity with SQL
Interest and/or experience in Motors a plus, but not required
Knowledge of ecommerce and market landscape

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

A day in the life of a Capital One Data Analyst.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making. As a Data Analyst at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and agony in their financial lives.

Responsibilities:


Writing SQL to clean, transform, investigate data.
Working closely with business partners to harness the power of data in compliance testing.

Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of digital banking and the financial world of tomorrow.

Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in un-mined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.


Basic Qualifications:


Will obtain or have obtained a Bachelor’s degree or higher and graduating in 2024-2025

About Tarion




Since 1976, Tarion has served new home buyers and new homeowners by ensuring that one of their life’s biggest investments is protected.

How We Make a Difference




A home is one of life’s biggest purchases. As an independent, not-for-profit organization, Tarion provides Ontario’s new home buyers and owners with peace of mind that their purchase is safeguarded through the province’s new home warranty and protection program.




Almost every new home in the province is covered by a new home warranty. Tarion ensures consumer protection by providing free tools, guides and resources to help homeowners understand their builder’s warranty and navigate warranty claims with confidence.

If a builder does not meet their warranty commitments, Tarion offers guidance to help homeowners ensure they receive the coverage they’re entitled to, and when necessary, steps in to help resolve warranty claims.

As a team member with the Reporting, Insights and Performance Team at ATB, you can expect:


Each week, month and quarter will require you to build on what you've learned previously as we’re learning, iterating and making big steps towards our vision of executing our 2030 Strategy.
We focus on outcomes, not outputs. You will typically be presented with problems to solve and not tasks to complete.

You will be part of building an effective horizontal data team.

Float's team is customer-obsessed, passionate, vibrant, and entrepreneurial, and includes executives from Uber, Shopify, Ritual, and many other incredible tech companies!

At Float, everyone is an owner, bringing their unique perspective to our team and product. Your voice is important, and we take having a culture based on feedback seriously. We openly share our thoughts, feedback, and differing opinions so we can continue to improve. We do our best to keep our decision making decentralized so that all team members contribute.

Requirements

About the Senior Product Data Analyst role:

We are seeking a Senior Data Analyst to join our team and help build and develop the foundations for the data analytics practice at Float. You will play a critical role in establishing and scaling our data processes and business intelligence systems, specifically those within the product and engineering organization. This position requires a deep understanding of data analysis, a strong technical background, and experience working with modern data tools. In addition to contributing directly to our Data vision and roadmap you will have the opportunity to help shape the future team that will keep driving this vision forward.

Key Responsibilities:

As a Senior Product Data Analyst at Float, you will:


Collaborate with cross-functional product teams to find the most impactful products and features to build and analyze the impact of these products and features on customer outcomes
Design, build, and maintain robust dashboards and reports in Metabase for internal stakeholders
Develop and optimize queries to support data analysis and reporting
Dig into our business to uncover insights and areas of opportunity both for Float and our customers
Lead the implementation of scalable data models and processes that will support the future growth of the analytics team
Work closely with data scientists and product teams to ensure data quality, integrity, and alignment with business needs
Identify opportunities to improve data processes, drive automation, and optimize performance



Key Skills and Experiences:


5+ years of experience in data analysis, ideally in a product-focused environment
Proficient in SQL for querying large datasets, developing complex queries, and optimizing database performance
Experience with A/B testing, hypothesis testing, and statistical analysis to evaluate product and feature impact
Expertise in building and maintaining dashboards and reports, particularly in Metabase or other BI tools (Tableau, Looker, Power BI. Google Sheets)
Familiarity with advanced analytics tools like Python, R, or similar for data manipulation and statistical analysis
Strong analytical thinking, capable of digging deep into business problems to uncover hidden insights and areas of opportunity



You'll be great in this role if:

You're an owner. You love a challenge, and take great satisfaction in tackling them head on. You love being a pioneer and taking on any task (big or small) and driving it through to completion. You are also comfortable making independent decisions and following your instincts to be able to move quickly.

You're able to explain complex problems in simple terms. As you'll be communicating and collaborating with a variety of stakeholders with varying levels of technical and product knowledge, your ability to present findings in an understandable way is vital.

You have solid technical skills. Strong skills in development, data technologies, analytics engineering and a good grasp of the analytics and data science space will be an asset.

You understand the business context. You'll be more effective if you understand how your role supports the business and where you can influence the vision and strategy of Float.

You're comfortable with a fast-paced environment. Float is a dynamic environment and things can change quickly. You should be flexible and able to adapt to changes as they occur.

You have a strategic mindset. You act in the now but plan for the future. You see where our core product analytics needs to go, put a plan in place and proactively drive that change.

You can balance attention to detail and strategic thinking. While it's important to delve into the details of your data, it's equally important to keep the big picture in mind.

You ruthlessly prioritize. You will have multiple responsibilities and projects. Being able to effectively manage your workload and meet deadlines is crucial.

You're eager to continue your own learning. Scrappy and voracious, you want to know the ‘why' behind every answer. You love to have healthy debates with fellow developers and colleagues about the product.

This role won't be a fit if:


You're not extremely detail oriented
You are not open to a hybrid role (based in Toronto)
You aren't a self-starter and don't like to work independently
You're not comfortable wearing multiple hats
You don't like change and adapting to new ways of doing things
You aren't comfortable with ambiguity
You aren't able to translate technical jargon into simple language
You lack patience for iterative work
You want detailed to-dos for your tasks and projects
You're not keen on learning new things
You don't have strong stakeholder management skills
You don't like regular feedback on your work


Don't meet every single requirement? If you're excited about this role, and you strongly align with our values but your past experience doesn't align perfectly, we encourage you to apply anyway. You may be the right candidate for this, or other future positions.

Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

A day in the life of a Capital One Data Analyst.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making. As a Data Analyst at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and agony in their financial lives.

Responsibilities:


Writing SQL to clean, transform, investigate data.
Working closely with business partners to harness the power of data in compliance testing.

Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of digital banking and the financial world of tomorrow.

Curious: You ask why, you explore, and you’re not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You know SQL and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.

Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in un-mined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.

About Tarion

Almost every new home in the province is covered by a new home warranty. Tarion ensures consumer protection by providing free tools, guides and resources to help homeowners understand their builder’s warranty and navigate warranty claims with confidence.
