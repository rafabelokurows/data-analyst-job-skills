Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It’s where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you’ll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You’ll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Creating a life you love also means finding a career that celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences that you bring. As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

The mission of the Business Operations team is to assess how well Pinterest’s strategy is delivering enterprise performance and influence exec-level decisions to evolve strategy and operations accordingly. As the Data Analyst II (Users & Engagement), you will shape, support and deliver on the analytical agenda that provides critical business insights for our Exec Team while partnering with Product, Engineering, Data Science, and others to improve how we execute. With a combination of exceptional analytical skills, insatiable curiosity, and strong partnering skills, you’ll help us better understand how to grow user adoption and engagement on Pinterest.

What You’ll Do


Business Analytics & Reporting. Develop a deep understanding of the Users & Engagement challenges and roadmap and how they drive our business / user experience to inform important decisions and priorities across the organization. Define critical KPIs and build key reporting deliverables and dashboards to help senior leadership understand key metric movements and trends, drive operational rigor and manage performance.
Planning & Forecasting. Manage the forecast models for core topline metrics that drive company-wide forecasting, goal-setting, and strategic planning. Work with a range of senior leaders to update their strategic priorities and goals on a regular basis.
Strategy & Special Projects. Tackle ambiguous strategic questions and critical business initiatives, and partner with leaders throughout Pinterest to build business cases for potential investments. Present insights and recommendations to senior leadership, and drive the “follow through” of those recommendations to ensure smooth execution with a diverse array of cross-functional partners.



What We’re Looking For


Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as economics, business administration, or data analytics or equivalent experience.
3+ years of experience in analytical or strategic roles. You’ve been a top performer in an investing, consulting, investment banking, product, and/or other highly analytical role at a fast-growing company; knowledge of the consumer internet and media ecosystem is a plus.
Exceptional data analysis skills. You’re a true expert in a variety of analytical tools, including SQL, Tableau, and Excel (and in areas you’re not, you have the growth mindset to learn it); knowledge of Python and R is a plus.
Entrepreneurial self-starter. You thrive in a fast-moving, ambiguous environment, and are independently capable of seeking information, corralling resources, and delivering results without waiting for direction.
Strong communication skills. You can move seamlessly between conversing with engineers or frontline ops employees and leading presentations with senior executives.
High-energy, positive team player. You have a proven ability to build strong working relationships with business partners; this is a highly cross-functional role, so a low ego and a high instinct for collaboration are musts.
Keen aptitude to scale the team. Help build out processes for a small (but mighty) team. Help build our influence across the organization to tackle each of the above for your coverage area.
