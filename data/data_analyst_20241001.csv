At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

We are looking for a Data Analyst that is passionate about metrics and telling the stories behind the data. We have several roles open across different teams (grocery, loyalty, restaurants). Data Analysts at Deliveroo report into our data science management team.

You will be a professional in insights storytelling, communication and visualisation and know how to create action from metrics. Crafting effective intelligent benchmarks, understanding performance, caring about data quality, enabling automation and creating phenomenal visualisations and stories are things that drive you.

What you'll be doing



Work closely with commercial stakeholders to create value and business impact through better data availability, visualisation and analysis
Discover, analyse, and interpret trends or patterns in complex datasets to perform ad-hoc analyses and deliver insights to the executive team and senior management
Understand key drivers of the business and provide data driven guidance on key levers
Identify and specify data needs and quality requirements and work closely with Analytics Engineers to ensure data is available, accurate and corresponds to the business needs
Consolidate and distribute best analytical practices from different teams and countries



Requirements



Experience identifying the root cause of problems, assessing risks/impacts and determining and implementing effective solutions.
A good understanding of querying in SQL and understanding of database structure - you'll be expected to be able to extract the data you need for your analysis.
Compelling story-telling skills, and an eye for powerful visualisations - you'll need to translate your findings for all levels of stakeholder (business and technical)
Good knowledge of Excel/GSheets - depending on the task, there is a good chance that this is where some of your exploratory analysis will take place. Being comfortable with pivot tables and functions will be essential.
Developer experience with a data visualisation tool (Looker, Tableau, Periscope)

Closing Date: 30 September 2024

Position Ref: AI 1293

Location: Flexible within the UK. Home-based, blended or fully office based (from our offices in Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh or London).

Hours: Full-time (see 'Flexible working')

Salary: Up to £ 35,360 per annum (depending on experience)




Who we are




We are a leading and trusted organisation, dedicated to promoting energy efficiency, low carbon transport and sustainable energy use. We aim to address the climate emergency and deliver the wider benefits of clean energy as we transition to net zero.

We don’t just offer jobs – we offer careers. For our people, being part of the effort to address the climate emergency makes working for us truly meaningful and rewarding.

Here are some of the benefits we offer:




We offer an outstanding pension scheme including employer contributions of up to 9%, 11% or 13% (age-linked).
Enhanced parental leave.
Private BUPA insurance.
25 days annual leave plus bank holidays, with service-linked increases as well as three goodwill days over the Christmas period.
Staff wellbeing allowance of up to £25 per month / £300 per year.




The team




The Digital department is a hub of expertise at our organisation, bringing together digital delivery, product, design, data and engineering.
The Data and Analytics team sits within the Digital department and is responsible for setting the standards and best practice in working with data for the entire organisation.

The role




As a member of the Data and Analytics team, you’ll be responsible for delivering data analysis, insight, and consultancy services to a range of clients, including central and local government, energy suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers. We assist these organisations by helping them understand the potential costs and benefits of different approaches to retrofit planning, decarbonisation, and fuel poverty mitigation, which in turn allows them to develop more effective policies and strategies.




What you’ll do




As an analytics expert, you’ll work closely with our team to update and improve our ‘Home Analytics’ data service. Home Analytics brings together numerous datasets on the UK housing stock.
By applying advanced statistical and geo-spatial models, Home Analytics predicts the potential for energy efficiency improvements in every home across Great Britain.
You’ll be responsible for contributing to our regular update and improvement processes and for using Home Analytics to help solve client problems through the development of interactive maps and dashboards as well as bespoke analysis and reporting.




What you’ll bring




The role will be suited to a fast learner with a strong interest in data analysis. Demonstrated experience in one or more relevant areas (eg R programming, statistical modelling, Power BI, database management, GIS) and the desire to develop these skills further is important.
Your ability to plan and prioritise work is essential in this busy environment, along with demonstrated effective communication skills enabling you to deliver a high standard of customer service.
Experience working collaboratively with colleagues across teams and roles to deliver data-driven insights and process improvements will underpin the successful delivery of this role.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.




To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.




For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.




A few examples of your responsibilities

Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.




What we look for

Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.




What we offer

Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of €52,246. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.




Commitment & contract

Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time.




Location

Milan (Italy) or fully remote.




Before you apply

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We’re extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don’t hesitate to apply.




The selection process

We welcome applications in English and Italian. If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.




Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested at accommodations-ext@bendingspoons.com.




Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

In this role, you’ll dive deep into the heart of our supply chain, logistics, and warehouse management to uncover insights that will streamline processes and improve efficiency.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office.

Working with us

How do we do things at Capital One Canada? We listen — to our people, and to our customers. We change with the times and have adopted a flexible hybrid model (remote and/or in-office). A flexible hybrid working model is one that creates the opportunity to match the work that we do to the environment that best supports that work. Associates working in the hybrid model are expected to come into the office 3 days a week across Tuesdays and Thursdays, reserving Mondays and Fridays as company-wide virtual days. As was true before the pandemic, expectations of being in the office will be balanced with personal life flexibility. We recognize that everyone has a unique working pattern so we’re open to discussing flexible working arrangements that will best accommodate you.

At Capital One we’re committed to diversity, inclusion and belonging . We strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and inclusive behaviours are embedded in everything we do to positively impact associates. Strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and to help challenge the status quo and create the best outcomes for everyone.

We’re focused on helping associates live well—physically, financially and emotionally. When you join us, we support you and those who are most important to you, offering full coverage for spouses, domestic partners, and dependents. We’ve designed our benefits program to be flexible, comprehensive and consistent across our organization. From health and fitness center discounts, to training and professional development programs—and much more—you’ll discover that Capital One is committed to helping you live your best life.

Capital One Canada is an equal opportunity employer committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment. We consider all qualified applicants and will meet the needs of those requiring reasonable accommodations.

A day in the life of a Capital One Data Analyst.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making. As a Data Analyst at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and agony in their financial lives.

Responsibilities:


Writing SQL to clean, transform, investigate data.
Working closely with business partners to harness the power of data in compliance testing.
Designing rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas.
Ensure data and intent integrity by automated data quality verification pipelines.
Supporting and consulting with the business to propagate data management best practices.
Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of digital banking and the financial world of tomorrow.
Investigating the use of technology to automate compliance testing.

Float's team is customer-obsessed, passionate, vibrant, and entrepreneurial, and includes executives from Uber, Shopify, Ritual, and many other incredible tech companies!

At Float, everyone is an owner, bringing their unique perspective to our team and product. Your voice is important, and we take having a culture based on feedback seriously. We openly share our thoughts, feedback, and differing opinions so we can continue to improve. We do our best to keep our decision making decentralized so that all team members contribute.

We're making finance more accessible and saving companies and their teams time and money, while disrupting the multi-trillion dollar global B2B finance industry. Backed by some of the best venture capital investors in the world, including Tiger Global, Golden Ventures, and Susa Ventures, we're looking for pioneers to help us achieve our vision.

Requirements

About the Senior Product Data Analyst role:

We are seeking a Senior Data Analyst to join our team and help build and develop the foundations for the data analytics practice at Float. You will play a critical role in establishing and scaling our data processes and business intelligence systems, specifically those within the product and engineering organization. This position requires a deep understanding of data analysis, a strong technical background, and experience working with modern data tools. In addition to contributing directly to our Data vision and roadmap you will have the opportunity to help shape the future team that will keep driving this vision forward.

Key Responsibilities:

As a Senior Product Data Analyst at Float, you will:


Collaborate with cross-functional product teams to find the most impactful products and features to build and analyze the impact of these products and features on customer outcomes
Design, build, and maintain robust dashboards and reports in Metabase for internal stakeholders
Develop and optimize queries to support data analysis and reporting
Dig into our business to uncover insights and areas of opportunity both for Float and our customers
Lead the implementation of scalable data models and processes that will support the future growth of the analytics team
Work closely with data scientists and product teams to ensure data quality, integrity, and alignment with business needs
Identify opportunities to improve data processes, drive automation, and optimize performance



Key Skills and Experiences:


5+ years of experience in data analysis, ideally in a product-focused environment
Proficient in SQL for querying large datasets, developing complex queries, and optimizing database performance
Experience with A/B testing, hypothesis testing, and statistical analysis to evaluate product and feature impact
Expertise in building and maintaining dashboards and reports, particularly in Metabase or other BI tools (Tableau, Looker, Power BI. Google Sheets)
Familiarity with advanced analytics tools like Python, R, or similar for data manipulation and statistical analysis
Strong analytical thinking, capable of digging deep into business problems to uncover hidden insights and areas of opportunity



You'll be great in this role if:

You're an owner. You love a challenge, and take great satisfaction in tackling them head on. You love being a pioneer and taking on any task (big or small) and driving it through to completion. You are also comfortable making independent decisions and following your instincts to be able to move quickly.

You're able to explain complex problems in simple terms. As you'll be communicating and collaborating with a variety of stakeholders with varying levels of technical and product knowledge, your ability to present findings in an understandable way is vital.

You have solid technical skills. Strong skills in development, data technologies, analytics engineering and a good grasp of the analytics and data science space will be an asset.

You understand the business context. You'll be more effective if you understand how your role supports the business and where you can influence the vision and strategy of Float.

You're comfortable with a fast-paced environment. Float is a dynamic environment and things can change quickly. You should be flexible and able to adapt to changes as they occur.

You have a strategic mindset. You act in the now but plan for the future. You see where our core product analytics needs to go, put a plan in place and proactively drive that change.

You can balance attention to detail and strategic thinking. While it's important to delve into the details of your data, it's equally important to keep the big picture in mind.

You ruthlessly prioritize. You will have multiple responsibilities and projects. Being able to effectively manage your workload and meet deadlines is crucial.

You're eager to continue your own learning. Scrappy and voracious, you want to know the ‘why' behind every answer. You love to have healthy debates with fellow developers and colleagues about the product.

This role won't be a fit if:


You're not extremely detail oriented
You are not open to a hybrid role
You aren't a self-starter and don't like to work independently
You're not comfortable wearing multiple hats
You don't like change and adapting to new ways of doing things
You aren't comfortable with ambiguity
You aren't able to translate technical jargon into simple language
You lack patience for iterative work
You want detailed to-dos for your tasks and projects
You're not keen on learning new things
You don't have strong stakeholder management skills
You don't like regular feedback on your work


Don't meet every single requirement? If you're excited about this role, and you strongly align with our values but your past experience doesn't align perfectly, we encourage you to apply anyway. You may be the right candidate for this, or other future positions.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

A flexible hybrid working model is one that creates the opportunity to match the work that we do to the environment that best supports that work. Associates working in the hybrid model are expected to come into the office 3 days a week across Tuesdays and Thursdays, reserving Mondays and Fridays as company-wide virtual days. As was true before the pandemic, expectations of being in the office will be balanced with personal life flexibility. We recognize that everyone has a unique working pattern so we’re open to discussing flexible working arrangements that will best accommodate you.

At Capital One we’re committed to diversity, inclusion and belonging . We strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and inclusive behaviours are embedded in everything we do to positively impact associates. Strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and to help challenge the status quo and create the best outcomes for everyone.

We’re focused on helping associates live well—physically, financially and emotionally. When you join us, we support you and those who are most important to you, offering full coverage for spouses, domestic partners, and dependents. We’ve designed our benefits program to be flexible, comprehensive and consistent across our organization.

Capital One Canada is an equal opportunity employer committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment. We consider all qualified applicants and will meet the needs of those requiring reasonable accommodations.

A day in the life of a Capital One Data Analyst.

At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do.

Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making. As a Data Analyst at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and agony in their financial lives.

Requirements

About the Senior Product Data Analyst role:

We are seeking a Senior Data Analyst to join our team and help build and develop the foundations for the data analytics practice at Float. You will play a critical role in establishing and scaling our data processes and business intelligence systems, specifically those within the product and engineering organization. This position requires a deep understanding of data analysis, a strong technical background, and experience working with modern data tools. In addition to contributing directly to our Data vision and roadmap you will have the opportunity to help shape the future team that will keep driving this vision forward.

Key Responsibilities:

As a Senior Product Data Analyst at Float, you will:


Collaborate with cross-functional product teams to find the most impactful products and features to build and analyze the impact of these products and features on customer outcomes
Design, build, and maintain robust dashboards and reports in Metabase for internal stakeholders
Develop and optimize queries to support data analysis and reporting
Dig into our business to uncover insights and areas of opportunity both for Float and our customers
Lead the implementation of scalable data models and processes that will support the future growth of the analytics team
Work closely with data scientists and product teams to ensure data quality, integrity, and alignment with business needs
Identify opportunities to improve data processes, drive automation, and optimize performance



Key Skills and Experiences:


5+ years of experience in data analysis, ideally in a product-focused environment
Proficient in SQL for querying large datasets, developing complex queries, and optimizing database performance
Experience with A/B testing, hypothesis testing, and statistical analysis to evaluate product and feature impact
Expertise in building and maintaining dashboards and reports, particularly in Metabase or other BI tools (Tableau, Looker, Power BI. Google Sheets)
Familiarity with advanced analytics tools like Python, R, or similar for data manipulation and statistical analysis
Strong analytical thinking, capable of digging deep into business problems to uncover hidden insights and areas of opportunity



You'll be great in this role if:

You're an owner. You love a challenge, and take great satisfaction in tackling them head on. You love being a pioneer and taking on any task (big or small) and driving it through to completion. You are also comfortable making independent decisions and following your instincts to be able to move quickly.

You're able to explain complex problems in simple terms. As you'll be communicating and collaborating with a variety of stakeholders with varying levels of technical and product knowledge, your ability to present findings in an understandable way is vital.

You have solid technical skills. Strong skills in development, data technologies, analytics engineering and a good grasp of the analytics and data science space will be an asset.

You understand the business context. You'll be more effective if you understand how your role supports the business and where you can influence the vision and strategy of Float.

You're comfortable with a fast-paced environment. Float is a dynamic environment and things can change quickly. You should be flexible and able to adapt to changes as they occur.

You have a strategic mindset. You act in the now but plan for the future. You see where our core product analytics needs to go, put a plan in place and proactively drive that change.

You can balance attention to detail and strategic thinking. While it's important to delve into the details of your data, it's equally important to keep the big picture in mind.

You ruthlessly prioritize. You will have multiple responsibilities and projects. Being able to effectively manage your workload and meet deadlines is crucial.

You're eager to continue your own learning. Scrappy and voracious, you want to know the ‘why' behind every answer. You love to have healthy debates with fellow developers and colleagues about the product.

This role won't be a fit if:


You're not extremely detail oriented
You are not open to a hybrid role
You aren't a self-starter and don't like to work independently
You're not comfortable wearing multiple hats
You don't like change and adapting to new ways of doing things
You aren't comfortable with ambiguity
You aren't able to translate technical jargon into simple language
You lack patience for iterative work
You want detailed to-dos for your tasks and projects
You're not keen on learning new things
You don't have strong stakeholder management skills
You don't like regular feedback on your work


Don't meet every single requirement? If you're excited about this role, and you strongly align with our values but your past experience doesn't align perfectly, we encourage you to apply anyway. You may be the right candidate for this, or other future positions.
