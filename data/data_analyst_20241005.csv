This role will be based in our San Francisco office. You must be willing to work in office at least 2 days per week on Wednesday and Thursday, starting the week of January 6th, 2025. Employees will be able to work remotely for up to 4 weeks per year, for a minimum of one week at a time.

Responsibilities


Apply data visualization and storytelling skills in creating business intelligence solutions such as Looker dashboards that enable actionable insights.
Develop self-service data tools and processes, empowering business stakeholders to monitor the performance and health of their respective business areas independently.
Collaborate closely with Data Scientists to identify data sources, enable data pipelines, and support the development of data models to operationalize reports and dashboards.
Implement rigorous data quality checks to ensure the integrity and robustness of datasets used by dashboards, reports, and analysis.
Work hand-in-hand with various departments to understand their data needs and deliver tailored analysis and reporting to aid in their strategic planning.


Requirements


2+ years of similar experience in a professional setting
2+ years of experience working directly with Sales, Ops, or Product teams
Strong quantitative/analytical skills
Fluency in SQL to manipulate data and perform analyses
Strong communication skills and ability to work with different stakeholders
Must be willing to work in office 2 days per week on Wednesday and Thursday


Compensation

The expected salary range for this role is $93,600 - $117,000. However, the starting base pay will depend on a number of factors including the candidate’s location, skills, experience, market demands, and internal pay parity. Depending on the position offered, equity and other forms of compensation may be provided as part of a total compensation package.

Please be aware, job-seekers may be at risk of targeting by malicious actors looking for personal data. Brex recruiters will only reach out via LinkedIn or email with a brex.com domain. Any outreach claiming to be from Brex via other sources should be ignored.

Recidiviz is thrilled to be hiring a Data Analyst to join our team! We're a small, fast-moving group that works with complex criminal justice data from our state partners and develops analyses and tools that target the drivers of incarceration. That's where you come in. We're looking for someone who has attention to detail to improve our analysis, creativity and inquisitiveness to identify and solve open-ended problems, clarity to think through complex and variable data, flexibility to adjust in a rapidly evolving environment, and above all else, a collaborative, kind nature to add to our culture.

About Us

Recidiviz is creating safer, healthier communities by improving outcomes for people in the criminal justice system. We build technology to reduce the number of people in prison and to help criminal justice leaders embrace data-driven decision-making.

Using software tools and thoughtful product design, we've been able to safely and permanently reduce incarceration and improve outcomes. We work side-by-side with leaders of the criminal justice system, people in prison and on supervision, and ecosystem partners to build a better path forward. In addition to the revenue we earn from state partners, some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations support our work.

People who succeed at Recidiviz lead with kindness and humility, assume good intent, learn from failure, and fix problems when they see them. They are excited to work arm in arm with government leadership and staff to improve outcomes. They are great listeners. They build deep relationships with and empathy for the people we work with and the people who our mission serves, even when those two groups feel at odds.

About The Role

This role collaborates across several teams to guide work that targets the drivers of incarceration. Our Data Analysts work with diverse data – criminal justice data both raw and processed from across the country, reports and policy documents from government agencies, and much more – to develop our understanding of the criminal justice system and to motivate change. They perform analyses, contribute to tooling that improve our data and how we work with it, and help drive product launches by ensuring each product in each state has the analytical data required to drive the impact we seek. Our Data Analysts also play a key role in contextualizing and presenting their analyses to key stakeholders, both internal and external.

More about Recidiviz

Recidiviz was an all-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we've built an A-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator's 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.

Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) over 15 state partners – big and small, red and blue – and covers more than 40% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners – from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.

To learn more about how we do what we do, check out our 2023 Year in Review, read some press coverage, or watch our TED Talk. And if you're really keen to see our work, you can dive into our Github :).

An important note

Lasting change is always built on diversity. Recidiviz recruits, employs, trains, compensates and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, veteran status, ancestry, citizenship, marital status, gender identity and all protected status as required by applicable law. We consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you have a special need that requires accommodation, please let us know in your application. Even if you don't think you meet all the criteria above, drop your resume, and we'll take a look – you might be great for another role or another time!

Recidiviz is thrilled to be hiring a Data Analyst to join our team! We're a small, fast-moving group that works with complex criminal justice data from our state partners and develops analyses and tools that target the drivers of incarceration. That's where you come in. We're looking for someone who has attention to detail to improve our analysis, creativity and inquisitiveness to identify and solve open-ended problems, clarity to think through complex and variable data, flexibility to adjust in a rapidly evolving environment, and above all else, a collaborative, kind nature to add to our culture.

About Us

Recidiviz is creating safer, healthier communities by improving outcomes for people in the criminal justice system. We build technology to reduce the number of people in prison and to help criminal justice leaders embrace data-driven decision-making.

Using software tools and thoughtful product design, we've been able to safely and permanently reduce incarceration and improve outcomes. We work side-by-side with leaders of the criminal justice system, people in prison and on supervision, and ecosystem partners to build a better path forward. In addition to the revenue we earn from state partners, some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations support our work.

People who succeed at Recidiviz lead with kindness and humility, assume good intent, learn from failure, and fix problems when they see them. They are excited to work arm in arm with government leadership and staff to improve outcomes. They are great listeners. They build deep relationships with and empathy for the people we work with and the people who our mission serves, even when those two groups feel at odds.

About The Role

This role collaborates across several teams to guide work that targets the drivers of incarceration. Our Data Analysts work with diverse data – criminal justice data both raw and processed from across the country, reports and policy documents from government agencies, and much more – to develop our understanding of the criminal justice system and to motivate change. They perform analyses, contribute to tooling that improve our data and how we work with it, and help drive product launches by ensuring each product in each state has the analytical data required to drive the impact we seek. Our Data Analysts also play a key role in contextualizing and presenting their analyses to key stakeholders, both internal and external.

Travel is encouraged approximately once a quarter, and occasionally required.

Collaborating with our Product Management, Data Science, and Software Engineering teams to bring analyses and data modeling into production software
Analyzing trends and changes in areas related to our own work to understand how our products function


Wild success

A year from now:


You've driven impact. Your work has led to several launches of our products across the country and has helped quantify the impact those tools are having on the outcomes of the justice system.

Minimum Qualifications


3 or more years of professional experience exploring, analyzing, and processing complex datasets
Strong communication and collaboration skills, to help nurture a knowledgeable, data-oriented culture

Ability to inspect source data, reason about data models, examine results closely, and prepare data and analyses that are usable for various applications
Professional work experience using SQL to work with large datasets, including high proficiency writing efficient queries for more complex data extraction and transformation tasks
High familiarity with Python, specifically Pandas package, for tasks such as statistical analysis and data visualization


Preferred Qualifications


Experience working in a cross-functional organization that designs, builds, and launches products for users
Experience working with large datasets from the public sector, especially related to criminal justice
Familiarity with our data stack, which includes Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery, Looker, Jupyter notebooks, and Python/Pandas


Compensation

Compensation is standardized based on roles and responsibilities. This ensures equitable compensation and responsible stewardship of our resources. As such, we do not negotiate compensation offers.

The compensation for this role is: $97,000.

What we offer


Effective, extremely thoughtful colleagues, working together on a mission that matters

401(k) retirement plan with 5% company match and no vesting period

Free mental health support via Talkspace

More about Recidiviz

Recidiviz was an all-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we've built an A-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator's 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.

Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) over 15 state partners – big and small, red and blue – and covers more than 40% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners – from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.

To learn more about how we do what we do, check out our 2023 Year in Review, read some press coverage, or watch our TED Talk. And if you're really keen to see our work, you can dive into our Github :).

An important note

Lasting change is always built on diversity. Recidiviz recruits, employs, trains, compensates and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, veteran status, ancestry, citizenship, marital status, gender identity and all protected status as required by applicable law. We consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you have a special need that requires accommodation, please let us know in your application. Even if you don't think you meet all the criteria above, drop your resume, and we'll take a look – you might be great for another role or another time!

Recidiviz is thrilled to be hiring a Data Analyst to join our team! We're a small, fast-moving group that works with complex criminal justice data from our state partners and develops analyses and tools that target the drivers of incarceration. That's where you come in. We're looking for someone who has attention to detail to improve our analysis, creativity and inquisitiveness to identify and solve open-ended problems, clarity to think through complex and variable data, flexibility to adjust in a rapidly evolving environment, and above all else, a collaborative, kind nature to add to our culture.

About Us

Recidiviz is creating safer, healthier communities by improving outcomes for people in the criminal justice system. We build technology to reduce the number of people in prison and to help criminal justice leaders embrace data-driven decision-making.

Using software tools and thoughtful product design, we've been able to safely and permanently reduce incarceration and improve outcomes. We work side-by-side with leaders of the criminal justice system, people in prison and on supervision, and ecosystem partners to build a better path forward. In addition to the revenue we earn from state partners, some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations support our work.

People who succeed at Recidiviz lead with kindness and humility, assume good intent, learn from failure, and fix problems when they see them. They are excited to work arm in arm with government leadership and staff to improve outcomes. They are great listeners. They build deep relationships with and empathy for the people we work with and the people who our mission serves, even when those two groups feel at odds.

About The Role

This role collaborates across several teams to guide work that targets the drivers of incarceration. Our Data Analysts work with diverse data – criminal justice data both raw and processed from across the country, reports and policy documents from government agencies, and much more – to develop our understanding of the criminal justice system and to motivate change. They perform analyses, contribute to tooling that improve our data and how we work with it, and help drive product launches by ensuring each product in each state has the analytical data required to drive the impact we seek. Our Data Analysts also play a key role in contextualizing and presenting their analyses to key stakeholders, both internal and external.

Travel is encouraged approximately once a quarter, and occasionally required.

Core responsibilities


Exploring our datasets to find new insights about American criminal justice systems
Contextualizing and communicating key findings to internal and external stakeholders
Collaborating with our State Engagement and Implementation Engineering teams to design and execute on targeted roadmaps that drive impact in the states where we work
Collaborating with our Product Management, Data Science, and Software Engineering teams to bring analyses and data modeling into production software
Analyzing trends and changes in areas related to our own work to understand how our products function


Wild success

A year from now:


You've driven impact. Your work has led to several launches of our products across the country and has helped quantify the impact those tools are having on the outcomes of the justice system.
You've leveled up our analytical team. Your contributions to our tooling and processes, as well as your support for your teammates, has helped set our team up to achieve more impact sooner.


Minimum Qualifications


3 or more years of professional experience exploring, analyzing, and processing complex datasets
Strong communication and collaboration skills, to help nurture a knowledgeable, data-oriented culture
Enthusiasm for working with internal and external partners from diverse backgrounds and worldviews, such as government staff, researchers, journalists, technical staff, and practitioners in criminal justice reform
Ability to inspect source data, reason about data models, examine results closely, and prepare data and analyses that are usable for various applications
Professional work experience using SQL to work with large datasets, including high proficiency writing efficient queries for more complex data extraction and transformation tasks
High familiarity with Python, specifically Pandas package, for tasks such as statistical analysis and data visualization


Preferred Qualifications


Experience working in a cross-functional organization that designs, builds, and launches products for users
Experience working with large datasets from the public sector, especially related to criminal justice
Familiarity with our data stack, which includes Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery, Looker, Jupyter notebooks, and Python/Pandas


Compensation

Compensation is standardized based on roles and responsibilities. This ensures equitable compensation and responsible stewardship of our resources. As such, we do not negotiate compensation offers.

The compensation for this role is: $97,000.

What we offer


Effective, extremely thoughtful colleagues, working together on a mission that matters
90% medical, dental, and vision insurance coverage for you and your dependents
Flexible time off, including 20 days of PTO, 3 days of paid volunteering time, and 13 paid holidays
12 weeks of paid parental leave
401(k) retirement plan with 5% company match and no vesting period
Complimentary One Medical membership (depending on location)
Partnership with Carrot to provide employees with inclusive fertility and family-forming benefits, as well as a small but growing number of hormonal health and gender-affirming care benefits
Monthly ClassPass credit for personal wellness
Free mental health support via Talkspace
Well-located offices in Oakland and Manhattan, with the flexibility to work remotely or go into either office as you choose
An annual company offsite each spring and other ad-hoc gatherings
All the exhilarating challenges and stretch opportunities of a tech startup, combined with the mission-driven heart of a nonprofit


More about Recidiviz

Recidiviz was an all-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we've built an A-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator's 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.

Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) over 15 state partners – big and small, red and blue – and covers more than 40% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners – from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.

To learn more about how we do what we do, check out our 2023 Year in Review, read some press coverage, or watch our TED Talk. And if you're really keen to see our work, you can dive into our Github :).

An important note

Lasting change is always built on diversity. Recidiviz recruits, employs, trains, compensates and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, veteran status, ancestry, citizenship, marital status, gender identity and all protected status as required by applicable law. We consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you have a special need that requires accommodation, please let us know in your application. Even if you don't think you meet all the criteria above, drop your resume, and we'll take a look – you might be great for another role or another time!

Recidiviz is thrilled to be hiring a Data Analyst to join our team! We're a small, fast-moving group that works with complex criminal justice data from our state partners and develops analyses and tools that target the drivers of incarceration. That's where you come in. We're looking for someone who has attention to detail to improve our analysis, creativity and inquisitiveness to identify and solve open-ended problems, clarity to think through complex and variable data, flexibility to adjust in a rapidly evolving environment, and above all else, a collaborative, kind nature to add to our culture.

About Us

Recidiviz is creating safer, healthier communities by improving outcomes for people in the criminal justice system. We build technology to reduce the number of people in prison and to help criminal justice leaders embrace data-driven decision-making.

Using software tools and thoughtful product design, we've been able to safely and permanently reduce incarceration and improve outcomes. We work side-by-side with leaders of the criminal justice system, people in prison and on supervision, and ecosystem partners to build a better path forward. In addition to the revenue we earn from state partners, some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations support our work.

People who succeed at Recidiviz lead with kindness and humility, assume good intent, learn from failure, and fix problems when they see them. They are excited to work arm in arm with government leadership and staff to improve outcomes. They are great listeners. They build deep relationships with and empathy for the people we work with and the people who our mission serves, even when those two groups feel at odds.

About The Role

This role collaborates across several teams to guide work that targets the drivers of incarceration. Our Data Analysts work with diverse data – criminal justice data both raw and processed from across the country, reports and policy documents from government agencies, and much more – to develop our understanding of the criminal justice system and to motivate change. They perform analyses, contribute to tooling that improve our data and how we work with it, and help drive product launches by ensuring each product in each state has the analytical data required to drive the impact we seek. Our Data Analysts also play a key role in contextualizing and presenting their analyses to key stakeholders, both internal and external.

Travel is encouraged approximately once a quarter, and occasionally required.

Wild success

A year from now:

Minimum Qualifications


3 or more years of professional experience exploring, analyzing, and processing complex datasets
Strong communication and collaboration skills, to help nurture a knowledgeable, data-oriented culture

Ability to inspect source data, reason about data models, examine results closely, and prepare data and analyses that are usable for various applications
Professional work experience using SQL to work with large datasets, including high proficiency writing efficient queries for more complex data extraction and transformation tasks
High familiarity with Python, specifically Pandas package, for tasks such as statistical analysis and data visualization


Preferred Qualifications

More about Recidiviz

Recidiviz was an all-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we've built an A-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator's 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.

Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) over 15 state partners – big and small, red and blue – and covers more than 40% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners – from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.

To learn more about how we do what we do, check out our 2023 Year in Review, read some press coverage, or watch our TED Talk. And if you're really keen to see our work, you can dive into our Github :).

An important note

Lasting change is always built on diversity. Recidiviz recruits, employs, trains, compensates and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, veteran status, ancestry, citizenship, marital status, gender identity and all protected status as required by applicable law. We consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you have a special need that requires accommodation, please let us know in your application. Even if you don't think you meet all the criteria above, drop your resume, and we'll take a look – you might be great for another role or another time!

About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of 190 people and 37 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.
