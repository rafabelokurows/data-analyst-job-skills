About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of 190 people and 37 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

The ideal blend of stability and flexibility. A genuinely human employer that cares for people and the planet. True autonomy to shape what comes next, for us and you. This is the perfect platform to take your career where you want.

Back in 2005, we pioneered Europe’s first TV streaming service. Today, we’re the world’s first certified climate neutral TV streaming provider. 3 million users across three countries. Over 230 colleagues of 47 nationalities. We’re the grown-up start-up, helping to shape a better future since day one. That hasn’t changed, even if the world has. We’re friendly, international, inclusive – and our people say we’re reliable and transparent, too. It’s why they trust us and believe in what we do.

THE ROLE

Data is a core advantage of OTT/Unicast TV over traditional broadcast. As platform operators, we know exactly what content our users watch, how popular a show is, and how many seconds of each and every ad campaign is viewed. With roughly 3 million active users every month the data we collect from them allows for efficient and precise business processes and data-based decision making.

We want to build day-to-day business decisions more on hard facts and less on gut feeling. Therefore we are searching for a passionate Data Analyst to join our motivated and growing data team. You will be shaping the big data architecture at Zattoo and building data components that change the way data is leveraged at Zattoo!

THE DATA AND ANALYTICS TEAM

We are a diverse set of people ranging from Data Engineers (DEs) to Data Analysts and Machine Learning Engineers. We love bringing more value out of our data for the organization and truly drive data based decision making in all divisions. We are a bit nerdy and understand the heart of our business operations and our stakeholders to do our job well.

Zattoo operates in both the DtC and B2B space and combined with a TV streaming product, it is a dream company for a data professional to get maximum value out of data and learn new things everyday!

At Neople we're driven by our passion and experience in AI. We believe that AI can do lots of good, but we know it must be user-friendly in order to be widely adopted.

Our shared goal is to make it super easy for people to access helpful AI assistants in the workplace. That's why we're creating the most user-friendly digital co-workers powered by AI. More than 60 leading companies (like Levi’s, PSV, Rituals and Bax Music) have already hired a Neople to their team!

We’re growing fast and that’s why we’re looking for a new (human) colleague to join our stellar team! We're on the search for a highly motivated and resourceful Lead Data Analyst. If you’re fascinated by cutting edge AI systems, love to convert data insights into action, and you’re ready for the start-up adventure - we want to hear from you.

This can be your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to join one the fastest growing start-ups in one of the most exciting fields to work in.

We believe the people you work with are what make a job amazing. In this role you’ll be part of the Product team with Seyna (Head of Product) and Joep (CPO).

While those values define how we work together as humans, we’re also committed to creating digital co-workers that align with the same values.

The job

The Lead Data Analyst role at Neople is the first dedicated analytics role in the company (the work is currently being done by both AI Engineers and the Product team). That means the role combines data analytics, data engineering, and some data science skills - anything needed to get the insights we require.

As a Lead Data Analyst, you understand exactly how our Neople work and what defines their performance. By proactively working with stakeholders and gathering insights, you enable a data-driven way of working across the entire team.

Key Responsibilities


Own the data analytics function: proactively map out information needs, and provide visualizations to satisfy those needs
Own cross-functional data needs in the organization, and provide guidance to other teams on how to best utilize the data we have
Challenge data requests to understand the exact need, and whether or not a new insight is even required
Build the data infrastructure: make and update data engineering pipelines in our data warehouse, and define standard definitions to ensure consistency
Provide input to the product & tech team on opportunities to improve Neople performance


The Requirements


5+ years of experience in a similar role (e.g. Data analyst/engineer, BI engineer) in a start-up and/or SaaS environment
Technical skills: experienced with SQL, data engineering pipelines, data visualization, Python notebooks
Experience with conversational AI and LLM prompting
You have a strong belief in data-driven ways of working, and are willing to enable the organization on a path to become more data-driven
You can translate business- and customer goals into measurable metrics and clear visual insights
You don’t just execute, but you dig deep with stakeholders to understand the need for a specific insight
You’re a solution-oriented problem solver and don’t shy away from a challenge to investigate and resolve topics
You take a proactive role in defining metrics & improving observability of a Neople’s underlying systems
You’re constantly looking for opportunities to accelerate or automate your own work


Nice To Haves


Apart from working with data pipelines and creating them, experience with managing & administering a data warehouse


The offer


A competitive salary that matches market standards and matches your experience
Unlimited vacation
Opportunity to work in a fast-paced, high-growth startup environment
Collaborative culture with a supportive team, and loads of team events
A work week of 32-40 hours a week
Beautiful offices in the center of Amsterdam, Den Bosch, or Berlin, and a public transport card to get there
Great equipment to work with i.e. MacBook
A competitive equity package

Build the data infrastructure: make and update data engineering pipelines in our data warehouse, and define standard definitions to ensure consistency
Provide input to the product & tech team on opportunities to improve Neople performance


The Requirements


5+ years of experience in a similar role (e.g. Data analyst/engineer, BI engineer) in a start-up and/or SaaS environment

You have a strong belief in data-driven ways of working, and are willing to enable the organization on a path to become more data-driven

Apart from working with data pipelines and creating them, experience with managing & administering a data warehouse


The offer


A competitive salary that matches market standards and matches your experience
Unlimited vacation
Opportunity to work in a fast-paced, high-growth startup environment
Collaborative culture with a supportive team, and loads of team events
A work week of 32-40 hours a week

About The Opportunity

eBay Motors is a multi-billion dollar, global portfolio comprising the Parts & Accessories, Business & Industrial, Vehicles, and WHI (a B2B Parts & Accessories marketplace in US) businesses. These categories are not only among the largest on eBay and core to eBay’s strategic future, but also are actively innovating in the market and at eBay!

We are looking to hire an expert analyst, who will support the eBay UK’s Parts & Accessories leadership team and play an instrumental role in accelerating growth for P&A’s UK business. The role will utilise data and business case development to develop strategic insights, while ensuring operational excellence in planning, analytics, reporting, and teamwork across a broad cross-functional team. Our key partners include product, marketing, analytics, finance, operations, monetization, and business development, among many others.

The role demands a dual mentality: both that of a strategic leader—who has a deep understanding of the dynamics of two-sided marketplaces, can break down tough problems into clear frameworks, operate in ambiguity, and possesses strong data intuition—as well as someone who can move quickly and decisively as an embedded operator not afraid to get their hands dirty.

What you will accomplish


Serve as an analytics partner to the UK Parts & Accessories leadership team

Identify and execute against opportunities across the Parts & Accessories landscape that require strategic deep dives
Partner with Category Managers, partners, and sellers to drive key initiatives



What You Will Bring


Strategic problem solver with strong analytical/data science skills to dive into data and identity root causes
High degree of ownership and commitment to results
Self-motivated to find opportunities and challenges in the business
Communicates clearly, effectively, and proactively with strong listening, written, and verbal communication skills
Ambition to grow professionally and willingness to work hard, learn/adapt, and provide feedback both upward and to peer teams



Requirements


2+ years of related experience, ideally at a top-tier management consulting firm, investment bank, or in a strategy & planning role at a major corporation
Excellent analytical skills including familiarity with SQL
Interest and/or experience in Motors a plus, but not required
Knowledge of ecommerce and market landscape

The Group provides comprehensive breadth and depth of coverage across four core services: Market Making, Clearing, Hedging and Investment Solutions and Agency and Execution. It has a leading franchise in many major metals, energy and agricultural products, executing around 50 million trades and clearing 205 million contracts in 2022. The Group provides access to the world’s major commodity markets, covering a broad range of clients that include some of the largest commodity producers, consumers and traders, banks, hedge funds and asset managers.

Marex was established in 2005 but through its subsidiaries can trace its roots in the commodity markets back almost 100 years. Headquartered in London with 36 offices worldwide, the Group has over 1,800 employees across Europe, Asia and America.

For more information visit www.marex.com

Marex has unique access across markets with significant share globally both on and off exchange. The depth of knowledge amongst its teams and divisions provides its customers with clear advantage, and its technology-led service provides access to all major exchanges, order-flow management via screen, voice and DMA, plus award-winning data, insights and analytics.

The Technology Department delivers differentiation, scalability and security for the business. Reporting to the COO, Technology provides digital tools, software services and infrastructure globally to all business groups. Software development and support teams work in agile ‘streams’ aligned to specific business areas. Our other teams work enterprise-wide to provide critical services including our global service desk, network and system infrastructure, IT operations, security, enterprise architecture and design.

Role

The IT Group runs our enterprise-wide services to end users and actively manages the firm’s infrastructure and data. Within IT, Marex Technology has established a Data team that enables the firm to leverage data assets to increase productivity and improve business decisions, as well as maintain data compliance. The Data Team encompasses Data Analysis, Data Architecture, Data Intelligence and Machine Learning expertise. In recent years, they have developed a Data Lakehouse architecture, that is relied upon by different departments across the firm. Marex now seeks to strengthen its capabilities further and elevate the role of data in the operating models of Marex's businesses, directed by a strategy that aims to:


Decentralise access for discovering and consuming data. Empower the data-savvy, entrepreneurial business leaders and citizen developers with the tools to interrogate data sets to explore and unlock opportunities for new or data-driven products and services.
Provide a market-beating digital experience for clients by providing greater insight into their own data.
Build communities of practice around data management. Increase awareness and raise the profile of the data-driven opportunities for the firm.
Ensure that the capabilities and tools of the Data Intelligence team infuse with the goals and operating models of each business within the firm.
Ensure paid-for data is used efficiently, in a manner that aligns with our commercial agreements, and that such usage can be audited with any associated costs fairly attributed across data beneficiaries.


As a Data Analyst within the Enterprise Data team, you will be working daily within the Compliance business stream. You will act as a bridge between the business and Technology, cultivating relationships with data creators, data owners and data consumers and helping to ensure that data assets are properly defined and maintained within a central data catalogue.

You will be joining a dynamic and fast growing team and will have the opportunity to help shape how data is used, adding significant value to the Compliance function through your work. You will help to enable growth whilst automating and improving reporting & efficiency.

You will develop a deep understanding of how internally generated and externally sourced data is used and how it flows through the firm. You will help to identify datasets suitable for ingestion into Marex’s Data Platform and will work closely with other members of the Data Team to ensure the data is efficiently ingested, correctly modelled and well governed, for use in downstream Business Intelligence and Machine Learning solutions. Through your work you will unlock greater value from data, automating repetitive reporting tasks, and improving scalability across Compliance and the wider firm.

Identify and cultivate relationships with key data creators, data owners and data consumers.
Ensure data assets are properly defined and maintained within a central data catalogue.

About The Opportunity

eBay Motors is a multi-billion dollar, global portfolio comprising the Parts & Accessories, Business & Industrial, Vehicles, and WHI (a B2B Parts & Accessories marketplace in US) businesses. These categories are not only among the largest on eBay and core to eBay’s strategic future, but also are actively innovating in the market and at eBay!

We are looking to hire an expert analyst, who will support the eBay UK’s Parts & Accessories leadership team and play an instrumental role in accelerating growth for P&A’s UK business.

Our key partners include product, marketing, analytics, finance, operations, monetization, and business development, among many others.

The role demands a dual mentality: both that of a strategic leader—who has a deep understanding of the dynamics of two-sided marketplaces, can break down tough problems into clear frameworks, operate in ambiguity, and possesses strong data intuition—as well as someone who can move quickly and decisively as an embedded operator not afraid to get their hands dirty.

Serve as an analytics partner to the UK Parts & Accessories leadership team

Identify and execute against opportunities across the Parts & Accessories landscape that require strategic deep dives
Partner with Category Managers, partners, and sellers to drive key initiatives



What You Will Bring


Strategic problem solver with strong analytical/data science skills to dive into data and identity root causes
High degree of ownership and commitment to results
Self-motivated to find opportunities and challenges in the business

Requirements


2+ years of related experience, ideally at a top-tier management consulting firm, investment bank, or in a strategy & planning role at a major corporation
Excellent analytical skills including familiarity with SQL
Interest and/or experience in Motors a plus, but not required

Experience with ELT and Analytics Pipelines - You have hands-on experience with analytics pipelines and ELT processes, and ideally, you're familiar with DBT or similar tools.
Knowledge of Data Management and Warehousing - You understand database management, data warehouse design, and distributed systems, and you can apply this knowledge to build scalable data solutions.
Familiarity with BI Tools - You have experience with BI tools like Tableau, Looker, or Power BI, and can leverage these tools to create informative visualizations and dashboards.

PHSA is seeking to create a diverse workforce and to establish an inclusive and culturally safe environment. We invite applications and enquiries from all people, particularly those belonging to the historically, systemically, and/or persistently marginalized groups identified under the B.C. Human Rights Code.

One of PHSA’s North Star priorities is to eradicate Indigenous-specific racism, which includes dismantling barriers to health care employment at every level. We welcome Indigenous individuals to apply and/or contact the Sanya'kula Team (Indigenous Recruitment & Employee Experience) for support at indigenous.employment@phsa.ca.

Indigenous-specific anti-racism initiatives are rooted in addressing the unique forms of discrimination, historical and ongoing injustices, and marginalization faced by Indigenous peoples. These initiatives align with an Indigenous rights-based approach, recognizing the inherent rights and self-determination of Indigenous communities. PHSA must uphold legislative obligations and provincial commitments found in the foundational documents such as including Truth & Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action (2015), In Plain Sight (2020), BC's Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (2019), United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), Reclaiming Power and Place Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women & Girls Calls for Justice (2019), the Declaration Act Action Plan and Remembering Keegan: A First Nations Case Study.

The Company

Demonware is a member of the Activision family of studios. We work alongside engineers and creatives at our AAA partner studios and deliver the online and data services required by our franchises. We craft, develop, and host services for some of the world’s biggest video game franchises, including Call of Duty and Crash Bandicoot.

We are a technology company and dedicated to openness. This means collaborating to tackle problems, the freedom to talk to anyone, and the best idea wins. We take the work seriously; ourselves, not so much!

We’re open to work terms of 8+ months. If you just graduated, we still want to hear from you!

The Team

Demonware's data team is responsible for creating the services and infrastructure that ingest the billions of events our games emit each day. At this scale, the challenges we face empower our engineers to flex their creative engineering muscles. When we get things right the analysts, studios and developers that interact with our systems can rapidly go from question to insight without ever having to talk to us.

The Demonware data team also works with studios to model and instrument the things that matter. We work with our customers to ship data forward applications, ensure compliance of data produced and oversee the quality throughout.

Big Company Challenges, Small Company Culture

Demonware hosts millions of concurrently connected users. Some of the technologies we use are Python, Linux, MySQL, C++, and Erlang. We solve tough problems on a day-to-day basis, and interns have a huge impact on what we do. We’ve had interns produce code and have it running in production within the first three days of joining.

The Role


Design, develop, and support scalable and efficient data applications, tools and frameworks
Assist in developing solutions around our big data platforms using technologies such as Kafka, Spark, Airflow, Spark-Streaming, Flink, Beam, and others
Development of APIs & microservices to access, transform and deliver analytics data

Experience with distributed software development (scalability, efficiency)
Experience working with Big Data (Kafka, PubSub, Spark, Presto, Flink, Beam, etc.)
Experience working with AWS, GCP, or Azure cloud
Experience with CI/CD, unit and integration testing, orchestration and containerization tools e.g. GitHub, Jenkins, Airflow, Docker, Kubernetes, etc


Please list any additional experience you have with Linux at home, any programming-related hobbies and resulting projects, any exciting school assignments you worked on, any open-source involvement and a link to your code repository and/or blog.

Perks


Complimentary breakfast, lunch, and drinks from a fully stocked kitchen

Free games


How To Apply

You can apply directly through your Co-op office or directly apply at demonware.net

If you are not applying through your school program, please submit your resume, cover letter (optional but preferred) and a copy of your most recent school transcripts.

The standard base pay range for this role is 65,000 CAD annually. This value is the expected annualized base pay of interns in British Columbia, Canada. Ultimately, your offer will be based on several factors, including relevant education, performance, and work location. Your Talent Professional can share additional details for this role during the hiring process.

We love hearing from anyone who is enthusiastic about changing the games industry. Not sure you meet all qualifications? Let us decide!
