Our mission is simple: Make our cities better places to live through carsharing.

Carsharing empowers people to move in a smarter and more sustainable way: studies show that one shared car replaces between 5 and 8 privately owned cars, which frees up space in our cities while giving communities 24/7 access to cars when they need them.

With our connected car technology, users can quickly and easily book and unlock a wide variety of vehicles directly from our app, without ever having to meet anyone in person, carry an access card, wait in line, or coordinate picking up keys.

To reach our vision of a world where all cars are shared, we need a strong team to help us disrupt car ownership. We look for people who are curious, positive, and engaged; who can adapt and learn quickly; who have the skills and smarts to reach their goals autonomously, while having the generosity and mindset to work collaboratively. No matter your role, background, or level of experience, we believe that every member of the team can have an impact.
