Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our Ways of Working

We have team members located across the United States spanning multiple time zones. This means we put in extra effort to make sure we connect and collaborate in ways that make sense for us. We know how valuable the flexibility of remote work is for our employees.

We know that personal connection is the foundation for the great work we do together. In order to build those relationships with team members in other cities, we meet with coworkers in person two times a year at a full company offsite and a departmental offsite. These offsites are expected of employees and are great opportunities to meet the people you work with every day and to do some of the work that is much more difficult to do virtually.

What the Role Is

We are seeking an experienced and highly analytical Staff Data Analyst to join our Data Science & Analytics team. In this role, you will collaborate closely with the executive and finance teams to support business strategy, financial planning, and the identification of new strategic opportunities. You will play a key role in delivering actionable insights to drive decision-making and long-term growth.

The power of Babylist is in our product and the long term relationship we have with our users. We are continuing to improve our core user experience while exploring new ways to better support growing families. As a Staff Data Analyst, you will own strategic initiatives end to end, influence decision-making, mentor more junior data scientists and analysts, and lead in solving business problems based on Babylist's evolving strategic outlook.

The ideal candidate will possess a strategic analytics background and the business acumen to own stakeholder relationships with senior executives. They will also possess the ability to learn new domains and collaborate effectively to draw strategic insights from data using data analysis and statistical tools. You will report directly to the Director of Analytics.

Who You Are


An excellent analytical problem solver who is ambitious to drive tangible business impact and apply data to solve business problems
A great storyteller and communicator who can build relationships with a diverse set of senior stakeholders, approaching collaboration with a low ego and curiosity
An influential analyst with strong business and strategic sense, who delights in shaping vague questions into well-defined analyses and data solutions that drive decision making
A natural leader who loves to upskill their data community and has an established track record of driving team excellence and elevating junior peers
You have 7-10 years of relevant work experience and a University degree in a STEM related field
Mastery in advanced analytics techniques and statistical knowledge, with strong experience in SQL and Python


How You Will Make An Impact


Work with executive stakeholders to translate their questions and hypotheses into structured analysis that provide insights which will drive strategic decision making
Lead data initiatives and deliver deep analyses relating to strategic and financial explorations — scoping data for new opportunities, understanding the user landscape, and monitoring business trends
Define problem statements and explore the data on our user and consumer experience to make recommendations that will improve our business and user LTV over time
Own the design and project management of data product development to support your work (e.g. data models, reports, analyses), with a focus on ensuring the longevity of the insights you produce on the business, the product, and user trends
Proactively identify gaps and promote best practices within the Data Science & Analytics team, ensuring high delivery standards and execution
Mentor and coach data scientists and analysts, aiding in their professional development
Own and be a knowledge expert in our data tools
Effectively present and communicate analytics findings to senior leadership and the rest of the company
Create a lasting impact with data at the core of Babylists, acting as a multiplier to the business' bottom line


Why You Will Love Working At Babylist


We invest in the infrastructure you'll need to be supported and successful: tools, opportunities to connect with colleagues, and a stipend to help you set up your office
We build products that have a positive impact on millions of people's lives
We work at a sustainable pace which means work/life balance is a real thing here
We believe technology and data can solve hard problems
We believe in exceptional management
We are an antiracist organization and doing the work to support differences of all kinds
We offer competitive pay and meaningful opportunities for career advancement
We have great benefits like company paid medical, dental, and vision and a generous paid parental leave policy
We care about employee wellbeing with perks for physical, mental and emotional health, parenting, childcare, and financial planning


Babylist takes a market-based approach to pay, and pay may vary depending on your location. Your actual base salary will depend on factors such as your skills, qualifications, experience, and work location.

The estimated pay range for this role is CAD $180,000.00 - $270,000.00

In addition, Babylist offers equity, bonus, and benefits, including company paid health, dental and vision insurance, flexible spending account, and paid leave (including PTO and parental leave) in accordance with our applicable plans and policies.

We will never ask for payment, bank details, or personal financial information as part of the application process. All of our legitimate job postings can be found on our official career site.

Iterate on the service model by tuning and optimizing dozens of parameters such as dynamic routing engine settings, vehicle count and mix, supply positioning, service frequency, location and density of potential stops, and demand models. Collaborate with the client, operations managers, and other key stakeholders throughout this process. Support the client in setting targets and KPIs for the service prior to launch.
Provide technical support: Provide ongoing technical systems and analytics support to operations managers. Advise them on using the system’s dashboards and interpreting the data. Perform system configuration changes based on feedback from operations staff, drivers, and passengers.
Drive continuous improvement: Collaboratively develop weekly/monthly actions to drive continuous improvements, and to achieve the service’s objectives (e.g. user experience, ridership, operating efficiency, financials, etc.).
Improve internal processes and tooling: Identify ways to further automate and systematize our internal processes. Collaboratively champion internal process/tooling improvements.
Support product improvements: Expand your knowledge of the transportation industry, understand clients’ pain points and identify gaps/opportunities in the product. Share your insights with the product team and assist the product management team in designing new features/improvements to RideCo’s platform.
Educate and document: Continuously expand the collective knowledgebase of the company through multi-disciplinary learning, knowledge sharing through live demos, and updating/creating documentation on our knowledge management system.

Compensation

The expected salary range for this role is $116,000 - $145,000 CAD.

In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge and made a commitment to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. We invited others to join us and there are now more than 300 businesses and organizations across 51 industries and 29 countries that have signed the Pledge, which means we are collectively coming at the climate crisis from nearly every sector and nearly every angle.

As part of our efforts to decarbonize our business, we became the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in 2020. We are on a path to power our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025.

We recently announced that AWS will be water positive by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations. The company also announced its 2021 global water use efficiency (WUE) metric of 0.25 liters of water per kilowatt-hour, demonstrating AWS’s leadership in water efficiency among cloud providers. To learn more about AWS’s water+ commitment visit: Water Stewardship.

Come join the team that is building the tools and innovative technology to track and share sustainability metrics for our customers.

As a Data Engineering Leader with Amazon, you will mentor and lead engineers. You will guide your team towards the best data development practices. You will serve as a leader in the team to define the priorities and vision of the group. You will collaborate with users around the globe.

About Us

Inclusive Team Culture

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship & Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Key job responsibilities

Our team operates the public Customer Carbon Footprint Tool and we have a high bar for releasing data to tens of thousands of AWS customers each month.

The successful applicant will work with our Product and SDE teams to build data systems that will simplify bringing new models to customers and enhance the visibility into our underlying modeling process.

Experience with data modeling, warehousing and building ETL pipelines


Preferred Qualifications


Experience with AWS technologies like Redshift, S3, AWS Glue, EMR, Kinesis, FireHose, Lambda, and IAM roles and permissions
