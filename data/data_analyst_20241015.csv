About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of 190 people and 37 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

Analytics is the compass that guides Sephora on its strategic journey, and we are on the lookout for a Data Analyst who can harness the power of data to propel our business forward. As a Data Analyst, you'll play a critical role in analyzing and interpreting customer data to drive business decisions across our digital platforms. Leveraging your strong experience in BigQuery SQL, you'll craft scripts that seamlessly integrate back-end data with Google Analytics 4 for in-depth customer analysis and segmentation.




Your expertise in data modeling will enable you to map out data structures that support the creation and maintenance of dashboards and reports, tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) related to online engagement, traffic, conversion rates, and marketing effectiveness. In this role, you'll work with data visualization tools like Power BI and Google Data Studio to develop compelling visual reports that convey complex insights in a clear and actionable manner. Additionally, you'll ensure the accuracy and quality of data, while effectively communicating your insights to non-technical stakeholders.

You thrive in an ever-evolving landscape, where driving innovation and continuous improvement is paramount. We are looking for a detail-oriented Data Analyst with strong analytical skills, capable of working both independently and collaboratively within a dynamic team environment.

We value ambition paired with a logical mindset—individuals who are curious, inquisitive, and able to articulate suggestions with precision. You will utilize your strong foundation in BigQuery SQL, particularly in GA4 analysis, coupled with hands-on experience in data visualization using tools like Power BI. Your deep understanding of digital analytics, especially within Ecommerce and Retail, will enable you to provide actionable insights that drive business success. Your proficiency in digital analytics tools such as Google Analytics and Quantum Metric will be essential in providing recommendations that optimize performance.




Our ideal candidate will also possess:

Proficiency in Google Analytics, Quantum Metric, or similar digital analytics platforms.
Experience with Google Marketing Platform.
Strong communication skills, both written and verbal, for conveying complex data insights to non-technical stakeholders.
An eye for detail and a commitment to data accuracy and quality.
Familiarity with Google Tag Manager, A/B testing tools, competitor research using market share tools, setting up data feed APIs, and UX platforms would be advantageous.

Contract: 12 month Fixed Term Contract




Closing Date: 9th of October 2024. Please note, we may close vacancies early where we receive significant numbers of applications, so don’t delay!




As the nation’s leading pub, cider and beer company and the name behind a host of brilliant brands, we’re looking for equally brilliant people to help us on our journey to building a better future.




There’s so much more to HEINEKEN than meets the eye and right now, we’re looking for a new Data Analyst to join our Digital & Technology team!




About the role

The Data Analyst is responsible for maintaining and gathering data requirements for HEINEKEN UK (HUK). You’ll play a leading role in ensuring the global defined data requirements are understood, sourced, assessed and made fit for purpose.




This role will sit in the Data Management team and prioritise the delivery of frameworks, policies and ways of working by utilising data management tools to increase the quality and structure of HUK data.




So, what will you be doing? Here are some of the key accountabilities;

Lead data management requirements in the UK from start to finish, including planning, execution and validation across data exploration, discovery, cataloguing, governance & quality management.
Develop and execute modelling and cleansing plans, including mapping, data migration, transformation, and cleansing activities to support digital products
Collaborate with stakeholders to identify project requirements and define data management goals and objectives.
Evaluate legacy systems and data sources to determine the scope and complexity of the migration and cleansing effort.




Who we’re looking for?

We’re looking for a team player with a keen aye for detail! Ideally you’ll have an understanding of how data is used within a business and it’s impact on the wider company. You’ll often need to facilitate communication between business leaders and the tech teams, so strong communication skills are key.




If you;

Can effectively manage multiple projects and deliverables.
Have relevant knowledge of data management frameworks

Our ways of working

Our office sites operate a hybrid model. You’ll spend Tuesdays, Thursdays and one other day in the office and two days from home, although but you’re more than welcome to come and work from the office on those days too.

Scalexperts have partnered with a London based business who, as part of the beginning of a large scale data transformation, are looking to hire a Data Analyst on a permanent basis. Various departments within the business are keen to do more with their data, with the initial focus of the role involving the development and implementation of various dashboards within PowerBI. The role will also involve some data analysis with SQL, and requirements gathering from cross-functional teams - Marketing, Operations, Technology etc. The end goal of this initial phase is for a self-serve reporting capability to be built. The longer term vision for this role is to provide strategic analysis that aids in decision making whilst also ensuring a high level of data quality and governance across the company.




Although this role involves both analysis and technical work, the emphasis is on the analysis and reporting side with roughly 20% of the role involving SQL coding.




Key Responsibilities:

Working closely with the Head of Data to drive the implementation of the data strategy
Pushing the adoption of PowerBI, taking existing reports/tools and migrating them onto PowerBI using trusted data
Analyse the existing SQL database and ensure that it is fit for purpose, making alterations and recommendations where appropriate
Build frameworks with teams company wide to ensure that requirements for data and reporting are documented
Build strong relationships across the company to ensure the data strategy continues to align with the business strategy and aid in insights driven decision making
Ensure that the data the wider business has access to is of high quality and can be trusted




Key Skills Required:

3-6 years in a data/reporting/insights role, delivering analysis on how a business gathers, reports and stores its data
Previous experience of working with data from external-facing teams ie. sales/marketing
Experience with PowerBI and creating dashboards from scratch
Knowledge of SQL coding - ability to use stored procedures etc
Able to translate technical/data concepts to non-technical stakeholders
Experience presenting findings to stakeholders at all level - this transformation is being closely followed by multiple senior figures within the organisation
Comfortable in taking ownership - the data team is in it's infancy so there will be an onus on being able to adapt, working within a certain amount of ambiguity and providing value to the business despite a low level of data maturity
Experience within a SaaS/B2B company would be highly advantageous




This company are based in central London and operate a hybrid working model with 3 days/week in the office.

As a Junior HR Data Analyst, your primary objective will be to support, manage, and analyse large sets of employee data as part of the deployment of Workday across our global offices. You will work with local and technical teams across Europe and Asia to ensure consistency, clarity and accuracy across each data set.

Role Responsibilities:

Perform data collection, cleansing, reconciliation and validation to ensure data accuracy and integrity.
Assist in maintaining and updating our databases with current and accurate data.
Translate complex data requirements into easily digestible formats for diverse audiences, including local HR teams and key stakeholders.
Analyse and regularly audit data sets using Excel and other analytics tools like Alteryx to identify and resolve data discrepancies/issues/risks.
Identify opportunities for process improvement within the rollout of Workday globally.
Help key Workday users across the business audit their data and maintain data integrity.
Build knowledge and share data expertise and techniques with the wider HR team to champion a data-driven culture.




Role Requirements:

Similar experience in a previous full-time role, internship, or work placement, where you would have gained a strong set of transferable soft skills (e.g., attention to detail, adaptability, quick learning, collaboration, effective communication, etc.)
A strong grasp of Excel (e.g., pivot tables, VLOOKUPs, macros, etc.) A basic understanding of other data analysis techniques and tools like Alteryx would also be advantageous.
Workday experience is also a bonus but not essential.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.




To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.




For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.




A few examples of your responsibilities:

Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.




What we look for

Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.




What we offer

Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of €52,246. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.




Commitment & contract

Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time.




Location

Milan (Italy) or fully remote.




Before you apply

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We’re extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don’t hesitate to apply.




The selection process

We welcome applications in English and Italian. If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.




Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested at accommodations-ext@bendingspoons.com.




Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

More About Doctify

Doctify was launched in 2015 by Stephanie Eltz and Suman Saha, who met as trainee surgeons, to address the lack of a trusted or transparent online platform for patient reviews. While the likes of TripAdvisor, Trustpilot, and Glassdoor had enabled consumers around the world to search easily for verified feedback on products, services, and experiences, this model had yet to cut through in global healthcare.

Backed by transatlantic venture capital firm, Beringea, leading European investment funds Amadeus Capital Partners, Keen Ventures as well as investors such as Sir John Hegarty (founder of Saatchi & Saatchi), and Tom Teichmann (early investor in Lastminute.com, Notonthehighstreet.com, Made.com and Simba Sleep). To date, Doctify has raised over 30 million US dollars of investment.

Job description

This is a 6 Month fixed term contract




They are looking for a technical Business Analyst to support in the delivery of each initiative from within their Product team, drawing out key technical details and identifying areas of improvement through analytical thinking and problem solving. You’ll be owning business requirements & interfacing into the business, to ensure that objectives are covered in sprints. You’ll assist in all aspects of delivery and be able to link this to benefit realisation and where necessary in planning/ideation.




This will be an instrumental role as part of relatively new team. You’ll report into the Lifecycle Lead and help them to oversee full delivery of their strategy and goals.




The successful candidate must evidence experience of operating at pace, with ambiguity and be comfortable dealing with fast-moving, rapidly changing priorities as part of high-performing team.




This role offers a unique opportunity to join a team of forward-thinking innovators who are determined to reshape the way their company serves its customers. They're not just rethinking products and services—we're challenging legacy ways of working and driving a culture of ""get stuff done."" Their mission is to develop new offerings to the evolving needs of their customers.




If you thrive in fast-paced environments, love breaking barriers, and are ready to think outside the box, this is the role where you'll learn and grow like never before.




Who they are




The UK’s fastest broadband network. The nation’s best-loved mobile brand. And, one of the UK's biggest companies too.




Diverse, high performing teams - jam packed with serious talent. Together, they offer the UK more choice and better value, through their boundary-pushing, customer-championing values and ambitions.




Together, they are Virgin Media O2, and they can't wait to see what you can do.




Accessible, inclusive and equitable for all




Virgin Media O2 is an equal opportunities employer and they're working hard to remove bias and barriers for their people and candidates. So, they build equity and inclusion into everything they do, from the policies they craft to the relationships they shape. They support and encourage you to be your authentic self throughout your application journey with us.




The must haves




In order to be considered, you must have the following experience;




Strong technical skills with proven experience in translating business requirements to technical requirements, with the ability to refine and understand technical complexity and playback to business stakeholders

Strong stakeholder management skills

Experience of building, refining and prioritising an agile backlog

Tenacious, goal and result oriented, with the ability to deliver within tight timescales

Experience of operating at pace, with ambiguity and be comfortable dealing with fast-moving, rapidly changing priorities

Customer focused with the ability to identify customer experience issues and drive solutions




The other stuff they are looking for

They'd also love you to bring:




Experience in e-commerce care, sales or subscription management




What's in it for you




Their goal is to celebrate their people, their lives and everything in-between. They aim to create a culture that empowers everyone to bring the best versions of themselves to work each and every day. They believe the most inclusive and diverse culture makes for a better business and a brighter world!




Working at Virgin Media O2, you get a bumper reward package bursting with benefits, and loads of extras you can add if you’d like to. These are designed to support both you and your loved ones, making sure that you’re covered no matter what life throws your way.




Next steps




If they feel like a place where you can belong, they'd love to learn more about you as a person and your experience to date. Once you've submitted an application the next steps of the process, if successful, are likely to include a call from one of their Talent Acquisition Partners.




When you apply, you'll be asked about any adjustments you might need to support the recruitment process. Let them know, and they'll be sure to discuss it with you.




Please note: Applications will be reviewed, and interviews conducted throughout the duration of this advert, therefore they may bring the closing date forward. They encourage all interested applicants to apply as soon as possible. If you’re offered a job with them, it will be conditional, based on the passing of background checks. All roles require a criminal record check and some roles need a financial probity check. Your recruiter can provide you with more information if needed.




Thanks for your patience and for showing an interest in joining the Virgin Media O2 family.

1-to-3 years of experience in public relations, social monitoring, or strategic communications – agency (PR, advertising, or marketing) experience is an asset though not required.
Analytical thinking and the ability to turn complex problems into an actionable research plan.
Experiencing using any of the following media intelligence platforms (e.g., Brandwatch, Cision, Meltwater, Quid, OPoint).
Meticulous attention to detail.
Experience developing queries with Boolean logic.
Strong understanding of typical social media metrics, including Reach, Impressions, Engagement, Share of Voice, etc.
