Sobi Culture

At Sobi, we refuse to accept the status quo. This is because we have witnessed first-hand the challenges facing those affected by rare diseases and have used this knowledge to shape our business to find new ways of helping them.

As a specialized biopharmaceutical company, we are dedicated to rare diseases. And we see this focus as a strength. By effectively turning our research into ground-breaking treatments, we help make medicine more accessible and open up more possibilities for patients and more opportunities for those caring for them. This has been our approach since day one, but we know we can’t change the world of rare diseases on our own. Accomplishing this requires strong partnerships with patients, partners and stakeholders across the entire value chain. Together, we define how our business can create solutions that serve the needs of those affected by rare diseases while facilitating sustainable growth.

In 2022, Instabee was founded after combining Budbee and Instabox - two leading last-mile delivery companies with three consumer-facing brands: Budbee, Instabox, and Porterbuddy. Instabee serves millions of consumers across Europe with convenient deliveries and is on track to become the leading European e-commerce enabler. Always with the consumer at heart.

We’re fast, both in terms of parcel delivery and when it comes to growing our business. So far our journey has taken us from Sweden to the rest of Scandinavia and parts of continental Europe, but we have no plans on stopping anytime soon. As we continue to expand, the complexity of Instabee grows in parallel. With that in mind, we’re now looking for a Analytics Engineer to help on the journey ahead!





About the team

The Business Intelligence team has 2 main roles in play, Analytics Engineer and Data Analyst. We have developed a comprehensive way of working for ourselves and our stakeholders and build our solutions on the modern data stack using FiveTran, Python, DBT and Snowflake for data ingestion, storage and modeling with Tableau as our primary data visualization product.





What you will be doing

Within the Business Intelligence team, you will get the opportunity to shape how Instabee builds its analytical data layers which serve everyone in our organization and enable us to make better decisions. The data warehouse is a key asset that we use for multiple data processing purposes; while traditional BI is one use case we deploy, we also service data science investigations and create endpoints for our technology teams to use in our products and services.

Understands data modeling techniques and their value in delivering end user self-service

Has good programming skills (Python, Go)

Is able to use a data visualization and methodical approach to communicate your analytical findings

Understands the value of modern cloud computing and SaaS tools we have in play at Instabee (FiveTran, Snowflake, DBT, Tableau, Python)

Most companies ramble on about purpose and making the world a better place. And pretty often it feels a bit… well, forced. But we’d like to think that our story is special for real.




Our founders, Shadi Bitar and Ninos Malki, came to Sweden from Syria when they were kids. Books became their compass, guiding them through the maze of life, and helping them shape their destinies in a new world.




Their dream was bold: What if they could unlock the world of books for everyone, making knowledge and inspiration accessible to all? Fast forward a few years, and the tale of Nextory was born.




At Nextory, we've crafted a revolutionary monthly subscription that empowers our users to devour books like never before, be it through reading or listening. It's not just a product; it's a passport to endless adventure and enlightenment.




And now, we're on a quest to find a Data Engineer, someone as passionate as we are about making the world a happier place and enriching lives through the world of reading. Join our extraordinary team, and let's script a future where every day is a chapter of discovery, and every book is a key to a richer life.




WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING

As a Data Engineer at Nextory you will work with keeping and developing the data drivenness of Nextotry throughout the organization. With a curious, innovative and analytical mindset and tech-savvy approach you will fuel our data-driven teams.




Together with the team you will be responsible for data services which means, data warehousing, ML/AI, data quality and enabling data insights. You will build and run data pipelines, data warehouses, data frameworks and leverage ML/AI. We believe that you enjoy working autonomously in close collaboration with the cross-functional teams and other stakeholders.




You will be a part of an amazing team and be at the core of understanding a consumer subscription service - always with the continuous aspiration to increase reading! The position is based in Stockholm and you report to our COO.




WHO YOU ARE

We believe that you are currently working in a similar role at a fast-moving company. We believe that you would like to develop a thorough understanding of how consumers use our service and be part of delivering key insights. By using various development techniques, you will keep us in the forefront of creating the best customer experience as well as providing a great self-service data platform. We believe that you take pride in structuring, integrating and transforming data on a daily basis - you believe that data quality is key!

If you have ambitions (or experience!) of working with areas like ML and AI we would love to give you a platform to show your practice! You thrive working in a dynamic and unpretentious environment where you take great responsibility for our product and your team!




SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS

• We believe you have, for the field, relevant educational background

• We believe you have around 4 years of experience from working within the field

• We believe that you are an expert in SQL and have worked with Java, Python and/or similar languages

• We believe that you have experience with cloud infrastructure (Azure, AWS, GCP) and cloud data warehousing, preferably BigQuery or equivalent

• We believe that you have experience working with pipelines and data integration solutions with an ELT approach

• We believe that you have experience in operating, maintaining and ensuring quality of production grade software




We are looking forward to your application which should include a CV or LinkedIn profile.

We might, for example, see in an analysis that we need to change several customer’s info from one setup to another to have a more efficient way of working and to do changes you need to understand each customer’s situation, which might require detective work in our systems and an understanding of impacts from changes and w solution is best fit for each customer.

The person we are looking for would then be the person who understands how to do this and can perform actual change.
Be a person who can work with services and billing support cases
Example cases are that a customer wants to make a change in their service subscription or has received an inaccurate work then contains identifying and understanding the issue, finding a solution together with the customer, and making the solution happen. If a pattern can be identified then the person could also be a part of a business development act. A person who can help in testing of new IT developments and implementations locally. This is a functionality test focused on ensuring accuracy in our data and ensuring that input and extraction of our service, billing, and customer are done accurately and efficiently.


Requirements


All of the above requires a person who is structured, meticulous, has an eye for details and data quality, and can work independently, which requires a higher degree of logical thinking. The person should also not be afraid to align issues and solutions with customers and employees when needed, clear communication and being able to explain pedagogically are important.
The person is required to have good knowledge of common Microsoft Office tools, especially Excel, where this person should know how to use more complicated formulas (macro is not required).

We’re on the hunt for a skilled MicroStrategy Developer to help build innovative reporting solutions for our leading Financial Services customer.




In this role, you will have the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting tasks that bring these solutions to life. From analysing business requirements to designing the semantic layer, creating insightful reports and dashboards, ensuring data security, and managing the release of your work, every day will offer dynamic problem-solving opportunities.




You’ll play a key role in delivering high-quality solutions to production, making a real impact on how users interact with critical data. Your expertise will also help ensure that the reports are not only informative but also secure, as you will be responsible for applying data security measures and performing essential security checks.

The customer is looking for someone with extensive experience using MicroStrategy software, particularly in working with large datasets.

Most companies ramble on about purpose and making the world a better place. And pretty often it feels a bit… well, forced. But we’d like to think that our story is special for real.




Our founders, Shadi Bitar and Ninos Malki, came to Sweden from Syria when they were kids. Books became their compass, guiding them through the maze of life, and helping them shape their destinies in a new world.




Their dream was bold: What if they could unlock the world of books for everyone, making knowledge and inspiration accessible to all? Fast forward a few years, and the tale of Nextory was born.




At Nextory, we've crafted a revolutionary monthly subscription that empowers our users to devour books like never before, be it through reading or listening. It's not just a product; it's a passport to endless adventure and enlightenment.




And now, we're on a quest to find a Data Engineer, someone as passionate as we are about making the world a happier place and enriching lives through the world of reading. Join our extraordinary team, and let's script a future where every day is a chapter of discovery, and every book is a key to a richer life.




WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING

As a Data Engineer at Nextory you will work with keeping and developing the data drivenness of Nextotry throughout the organization. With a curious, innovative and analytical mindset and tech-savvy approach you will fuel our data-driven teams.




Together with the team you will be responsible for data services which means, data warehousing, ML/AI, data quality and enabling data insights. You will build and run data pipelines, data warehouses, data frameworks and leverage ML/AI. We believe that you enjoy working autonomously in close collaboration with the cross-functional teams and other stakeholders.




You will be a part of an amazing team and be at the core of understanding a consumer subscription service - always with the continuous aspiration to increase reading! The position is based in Stockholm and you report to our COO.




WHO YOU ARE

We believe that you are currently working in a similar role at a fast-moving company. We believe that you would like to develop a thorough understanding of how consumers use our service and be part of delivering key insights. By using various development techniques, you will keep us in the forefront of creating the best customer experience as well as providing a great self-service data platform. We believe that you take pride in structuring, integrating and transforming data on a daily basis - you believe that data quality is key!

If you have ambitions (or experience!) of working with areas like ML and AI we would love to give you a platform to show your practice! You thrive working in a dynamic and unpretentious environment where you take great responsibility for our product and your team!




SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS

• We believe you have, for the field, relevant educational background

• We believe you have around 4 years of experience from working within the field

• We believe that you are an expert in SQL and have worked with Java, Python and/or similar languages

• We believe that you have experience with cloud infrastructure (Azure, AWS, GCP) and cloud data warehousing, preferably BigQuery or equivalent

• We believe that you have experience working with pipelines and data integration solutions with an ELT approach

At Bolia, things are always in motion, and we have high ambitions for our IT solutions to create the absolute best experiences for our customers, colleagues, and partners. We are heavily data-driven in our decision-making, and we have a growing need for outstanding BI reports and analyses across the entire business. This includes anything from store personnel to back-office functions, and towards Bolia's management group.

In short, we have a wealth of data at Bolia, and we want to make even more and better use of it than we do today! To strengthen this effort, we are looking for a new colleague to act as an internal BI consultant with a primary focus on the PowerBI platform. In this role, you will have a broad interface across all departments at Bolia, and you will also collaborate with our many external partners in developing new reporting solutions.

Your Responsibilities

The tasks in the job can be numerous and varied, but examples of tasks include:


Drive and participate in the development of reporting solutions in both PowerBI and Excel to enhance BOLIA's ability to make the right decisions.
Ownership of Bolia’s BI platform, primarily focused on the back-end. However, you will also be expected to assist colleagues with front-end tasks as needed.
Play a crucial role in the ongoing project of taking our current on-prem BI platform to the next level using Microsoft Fabri (you will work closely with external partners).
Data processing and refinement on SQL Server, to enhance data quality and analysis capabilities.
Provide second-level support for BI backend-related tasks.
Vendor management and follow-up on deliveries from external partners.
Participate in various business projects in collaboration with all departments at BOLIA, especially your colleagues in the Business Development team, which primarily handles the front-end work.
Participate in a new BI Center of Excellence in BOLIA to align on the BI efforts.
Stay up to date with new possibilities and trends within your area, such as AI and Microsoft CoPilot for PowerBI.


BOLIA and our IT solutions are undergoing rapid development, providing you with the opportunity to make a significant impact from day one by setting the agenda within the BI area. You will be taking over from the current BI Consultant, who is moving on to new opportunities, and you will become a key figure at our headquarters, collaborating closely with many of your colleagues. Additionally, we will continue to engage external partners to assist with backend BI tasks, who will also serve as your professional sparring partners.

Your Skills

We value personality and practical experience far more than educational background, which can vary. The more of the following points you can check off, the better.


You have a desire to inspire and demonstrate the possibilities of using data and Business Intelligence to make better decisions.
You are a master of PowerBI and data modeling, which is your home court, and have experience in other parts of Microsoft's BI suite.
You have experience with SQL, SSIS and ETL-processes in general.
You have experience with data sources like Microsoft Dynamics 365 F&O and/or CE or similar.
You are self-driven but still a team player and eager to acquire new knowledge.
You have a great business understanding and can maintain an overview while also having an eye for detail.
You always deliver high quality in what you do.


Good to Know


We are in the heart of Aarhus, close to the train station, in what are arguably the most beautiful office spaces in Denmark!
There is a very active staff association that regularly organizes all sorts of events from parties to knitting clubs.
We have a young working environment with an amazing unity across all departments.
We are part of the Lars Larsen Group, which means that as an employee, you will receive a good staff discount in all Lars Larsen Group companies, including furniture, restaurants, and spa stays.
Our workday is flexible with possibilities for sometimes working from home.


How To Apply

We conduct interviews on an ongoing basis, so we recommend that you send your application and CV as soon as possible. If you have any questions about the position, please feel free to contact Head of IT Applications, Kasper Poulsen, on kpo@bolia.com.

All inquiries will be treated confidentially.

We look forward to hearing from you!

Could you see yourself thriving in a dynamic global culture, working on big and innovative projects that propel the Lenus brand towards an impactful vision of making the world a happier and healthier place? Then this could be the dream job you’ve been looking for.




Why business intelligence specialist and not data analyst?

While the role involves data analysis, the primary responsibility is to co-create solutions with business stakeholders and deliver tangible value. We don’t just build and ship dashboards, we build solutions that enable our stakeholders to reach their goals. Not everything we build is a dashboard. Sometimes it’s a sheet, sometimes it’s a steamlit app, sometimes it’s a product feature, etc. We put a lot of emphasis on business understanding and continuous collaboration. We don’t just deliver numbers but take active ownership of how numbers are used and how our deliveries create value.




Who are we looking for?




Key Responsibilities

As a BI Specialist, you will join us in our Business Intelligence and Data team in Copenhagen and you will:

Identify and design solutions that improve business performance and operational efficiency.
Be responsible for the entire process from requirement identification till successful adoption of deliverables.
Collaborate with stakeholders across business functions (Finance, Marketing, Sales amongst others) to understand data requirements and identify process improvement opportunities.
Design functional and easily interpretable visualizations that drive decision making.
Conduct workshops to educate teams on how to incorporate data in their daily processes.
Work with a high level of autonomy.




Qualifications

You are keen to work on a modern tech stack that is constantly evolving to better meet our business's rapid growth. We use BigQuery as our data warehouse, DBT to organise our business logic and Tableau to primarily visualize all of our data and insights.
You are familiar with Tableau or PowerBI - with some work experience in building the dashboards, preferably from a student position (up to 2 years of relevant experience from a full-time job position is also welcome).
You have a masters in business or a technical masters with some introductory business courses.
You are familiar with SQL to model large datasets.
You are the kind of person that is curious, proactive and a quick learner with solid business understanding.
You love visualizing complex datasets.
You have experience and/or willingness to work in a fast-paced agile environment.
You are motivated by professional challenges and intellectual sparring.




The Team

You will be a valued member of our close-knit team consisting of Data Scientists, BI Specialists and Data Engineers.

Our team is driven by excellent cooperation and dynamic sparring. We take ownership of our projects, come up with new ideas and strive to deliver with the highest quality. Our team is trusted with a great amount of responsibility and we take pride in our autonomous way of working. We trust each other to speak up if feeling stuck or if a new perspective is needed and you’ll find us chatting and sparring throughout the day. As a majority of the team are expats we have naturally become a part of each other’s lives outside Lenus through monthly board game nights, sports activities, team dinners, boat trips, etc.

If you recognize yourself in a setting like this, we’d love to have you on board!




Benefits & Perks

Structured and prioritised development opportunities
Development feedback cycle with quarterly check ins
Team events and monthly social events in all our offices
Company wide events like our summer party, end of year party and Lenus birthday party!
Sports and activities, like paddle tournaments, Workout Wednesdays, Run & Dip, and much more!

A Macbook and other hardware to support you in your daily work

Title: Associate Statistics and Data Analysis Officer (EGRISS)

ICA Level: IICA-1

Corresponding Level: P-2

Duty station: Copenhagen, Denmark

Duration: 01/01/2025 - 31/12/2025 (with possibility of extension)

General Background

UNHCR’s mandate to protect and find solutions for refugees and other forcibly displaced persons increasingly relies on the availability of timely and reliable data and analysis. The Agency's Global Data Service (GDS) based in Copenhagen, is the focal point in UNHCR for the implementation of its Data Transformation Strategy that has been put in place to facilitate this process over the next few years. Within this, the Statistics, Data Science and Survey Section (SDSS), coordinates the collection, analysis and dissemination of UNHCR's statistics, and provides technical statistical support to regional bureau and country offices. It aims to support the development of improved and more efficient systems for statistics on refugees and other persons of concern to UNHCR, such as stateless people and internally displaced persons (IDPs).

Increasingly, UNHCR’s data efforts are grounded in collaboration and joint engagements with partners to better achieve outcomes for those affected by forced displacement. In contexts of protracted displacement, working closely with governments and national statistical offices to enhance national ownership of data produced and better integrate refugees and IDPs into national statistical systems is a core priority. As part of this effort, UNHCR has taken a leading role in the Expert Group on Refugee, IDP and Statelessness Statistics (EGRISS), both as a Steering Committee member and through hosting its Secretariat. The EGRISS currently consists of 60 countries and 37 international/regional organisations. Other Steering Committee members include the World Bank, Eurostat, Statistics Norway, Joint IDP Profiling Service (JIPS) and United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), International Organization for Migration (IOM), World Bank-UNHCR Joint Data Center (JDC), United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (UNESCWA), Philippines, Colombia, Kurdistan Republic of Iraq and African Union’s Institute of Statistics (STATAFRIC).

The EGRISS was established in 2016 by the UN Statistical Commission to develop recommendations on refugee and IDP statistics and produce guidance for their implementation at country level. The International Recommendations on Refugee (IRRS) and IDP (IRIS) Statistics were endorsed in 2018 and 2020, respectively, under EGRISS' first two mandates. The International Recommendations on Statelessness Statistics (IROSS) were subsequently developed and endorsed in 2023. During 2020-2024, the EGRISS' mandate was expanded to focus on implementation of the recommendations which is ongoing through advocacy, capacity building, and further methodological development and testing. This work will continue through the group’s upcoming mandate period of 2025-2030.

All of EGRISS’ work is developed or conducted collaboratively with affected states and statistical experts from within its membership. The Secretariat therefore plays a critical role in coordinating, facilitating and supporting these collaborative efforts through a range of channels. The Associate Statistics and Data Analysis Officer will be part of the EGRISS Secretariat and support key activities, as outlined below, in order to help the Group successfully fulfill its mandate from the UNSC.

Purpose and Scope of Assignment

The Associate Statistics and Data Analysis Officer (EGRISS) will support the work of the Expert Group on Refugee, IDP and Statelessness Statistics (EGRISS). They will report to the Senior Statistics and Data Analysis Officer (EGRISS) and will work in close collaboration with other EGRISS Secretariat colleagues as well as members of the EGRISS Steering Committee and its broader membership.

Chris's everyday life at Accenture

I studied physics and mathematics and delved into quantum machine learning during my master's. Since I finished my studies in 2022, I have worked at Accenture as a data engineer in the Data&AI department. In my role as backend developer on a significant data platform project for one of our larger clients, I have mainly focused on backend development. I have also had the pleasure of exploring other areas such as front-end development and work with software release strategies, as well as CI/CD automation. This has given me a wide range of skills and experiences in various aspects of software development.

I am actively involved in our vibrant Data&AI community. We regularly organize presentations and invite external speakers to keep us up to date on the latest trends and innovations in the field. In addition, I take regular artificial intelligences and data-related courses to keep up to date with the ever-developing professional landscape. For me, the social aspect is just as important as the academic aspect. Fortunately, this is a group where well-being and togetherness are the focus. We see each other as friends as well as colleagues, and together we organize everything from social events to professional gatherings.

Aurora’s everyday life at Accenture

I have worked as a data engineer in Data&AI since 2022, after studying Computer Science and Engineering at DTU. At university, I immersed myself in various machine learning subjects, and finally ended up with a master's on predicting ship activity in the (partly untouched) Arctic. The combination of data analysis and ML algorithms added flavor, and luckily I get the opportunity to continue exploring this field here at Accenture, with fantastically talented and good colleagues!

I have previously worked on the same project as Chris as data engineer for a large digital transformation, where we use a number of technologies and frameworks for end-to-end development. I am currently on a smaller project working on developing a Generative AI solution through OpenAI. It is incredibly exciting and meaningful to apply today's technology to well-established processes at well-known players. GenAI is a hot topic, which is shown through great commitment to the project within Accenture and at the customer.

In addition to project work, I help lead Accenture's female mentorship program for university students. So there is a lot of variety that you can get involved in, while at the same time you have your belonging in our exotic Data & AI community. Here we are friends and colleagues with the same interests, although there is great variation in the number of years of experience and types of projects, which creates a fantastic starting point to learn from each other. Good atmosphere, low shoulders and commitment!

Does this sound interesting?

Then we would like to hear from you! Paradoxically, we prefer application letters not written by ChatGPT.

På den måde identificerer forbrugerpanelet, hvordan og hvornår markeder og brands ændrer sig. For kunderne laver vi morgendagens forudsigelser, så de kan træffe de rigtige beslutninger i dag.

Then you might be just who we are looking for as our new data engineer!

Here’s what the job entails
In the role, your primary function will be to work on data products related to the entire value chain – from pre-trading processes based on signals in the market, to registration of trades, and up until they have been settled. As part of the job, you will do backend development of data pipelines and products, exposing data and advising users on how to find the data they need in the most efficient way.

Concretely, your areas of responsibility will include the following:

collaborate with product owners, other data engineers and users in a dedicated portfolio team to discover new features and data products, leveraging the billions of data points we process every day
analyse, design and develop high quality, scalable data products to support business processes
maintain and continually improve products in the portfolio and the underlying data platform(s)
review other team members’ code and share learnings within the team as well as with the data engineering community in Danske Commodities
learn new technologies and transform your learnings into applicable tools to benefit our business stakeholders and your own development



Meet the team
As our new data engineer, you will join our Data Engineering and Architecture (DARC) team. Here, you will become part of a team of more than 30 data engineers, data scientists and software developers. We are a curious and motivated bunch – curious about each other, about the energy trading business model and, of course, about anything related to data and analytics. Our culture is informal and always with value creation at the forefront of everything we do. Personal development is a high priority, and you will get the opportunity to leverage your existing skill set and add new competencies along the way.

In the team, we enjoy getting together for dinners, paddle matches, mini golf – and not least, our epic DARC parties. At the workplace, everyone enjoys a high amount of flexibility to design a working day that matches their personal preferences.

But enough about us… over to you!
As you will be working with many different stakeholders whose needs you need to understand to create value, we are looking for someone with great collaboration skills. Also, as we handle a lot of data, we imagine that you take a structured approach to information processing.

Furthermore, we imagine that you:

are proficient in Microsoft SQL, i.e. you can document at least two years of experience
are experienced in dimensional modelling, i.e. you can document at least two years of experience
are proficient in English – both written and verbal
potentially have experience with any other programming languages for data (Python, Scala)



Please note that it is not a requirement to have prior knowledge of the energy industry to enter this role; however, prior knowledge or genuine interest in the industry would ensure a smoother onboarding experience.

We’ll take good care of you
At Danske Commodities, we take great care of our people. Joining us means you’ll get a lot of great perks – including social events, cultural experiences, tasty food and benefits to better your health, your life and your future.

Here are some of the benefits we offer our employees:

Flexible working hours including the opportunity to work part-time as well as the option to work from home up to two days per week
Vast development opportunities with the help of your own individual development plan, access to our DC University with 50+ courses as well as remote courses through Harvard Learning
Global career prospects as part of the Equinor group with +20,000 colleagues across the world
10% paid pension as well as a beneficial health care and insurance package
Great parental leave conditions from day one including 26 weeks of paid maternity leave and 16 weeks of paid paternity/co-parent leave as well as the opportunity to join the network Inspired Beyond Babies
Unlimited paid children’s sick days no limit on paid absence days in relation to child sickness
Extra days off five, to be exact, as well as a Yay Day (an additional day off dedicated to ‘me time’) every year – adding to the standard five weeks off each year
Senior days if you’re over 55 years old
Bonus scheme
Share savings meaning you have the opportunity to participate in our parent company Equinor’s attractive share savings programme
Paid at home internet and equipment including a mobile phone with paid subscription and IT equipment for when working from home
100+ yearly social and professional events including DC Sports and DC Talks events, gatherings in our book club, bicycle club, student network, wine club, CS:GO team and more
Various free tickets to family-friendly and cultural attractions
Discounts at hotels, restaurants, sports clubs and more
Organic food including a light breakfast, lunch buffet and snacks throughout the day
An office in the heart of Aarhus right next to the central train station



Recruitment process and relocation

What we’re about
We're a tech-driven energy trading company present in 42 markets across five continents. Our +600 people are driven by a need to constantly better things. If you are too, we could very well be the right place for you. You'll join a collective of thinkers and doers. Aspiring chefs, runners, parents, beekeepers, gamers – the list goes on.

Title: Associate Statistics and Data Analysis Officer (EGRISS)

ICA Level: IICA-1

Corresponding Level: P-2

Duty station: Copenhagen, Denmark

Duration: 01/01/2025 - 31/12/2025 (with possibility of extension)

General Background

UNHCR’s mandate to protect and find solutions for refugees and other forcibly displaced persons increasingly relies on the availability of timely and reliable data and analysis. The Agency's Global Data Service (GDS) based in Copenhagen, is the focal point in UNHCR for the implementation of its Data Transformation Strategy that has been put in place to facilitate this process over the next few years. Within this, the Statistics, Data Science and Survey Section (SDSS), coordinates the collection, analysis and dissemination of UNHCR's statistics, and provides technical statistical support to regional bureau and country offices. It aims to support the development of improved and more efficient systems for statistics on refugees and other persons of concern to UNHCR, such as stateless people and internally displaced persons (IDPs).

Increasingly, UNHCR’s data efforts are grounded in collaboration and joint engagements with partners to better achieve outcomes for those affected by forced displacement. In contexts of protracted displacement, working closely with governments and national statistical offices to enhance national ownership of data produced and better integrate refugees and IDPs into national statistical systems is a core priority. As part of this effort, UNHCR has taken a leading role in the Expert Group on Refugee, IDP and Statelessness Statistics (EGRISS), both as a Steering Committee member and through hosting its Secretariat. The EGRISS currently consists of 60 countries and 37 international/regional organisations. Other Steering Committee members include the World Bank, Eurostat, Statistics Norway, Joint IDP Profiling Service (JIPS) and United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), International Organization for Migration (IOM), World Bank-UNHCR Joint Data Center (JDC), United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (UNESCWA), Philippines, Colombia, Kurdistan Republic of Iraq and African Union’s Institute of Statistics (STATAFRIC).

The EGRISS was established in 2016 by the UN Statistical Commission to develop recommendations on refugee and IDP statistics and produce guidance for their implementation at country level. The International Recommendations on Refugee (IRRS) and IDP (IRIS) Statistics were endorsed in 2018 and 2020, respectively, under EGRISS' first two mandates. The International Recommendations on Statelessness Statistics (IROSS) were subsequently developed and endorsed in 2023. During 2020-2024, the EGRISS' mandate was expanded to focus on implementation of the recommendations which is ongoing through advocacy, capacity building, and further methodological development and testing. This work will continue through the group’s upcoming mandate period of 2025-2030.

All of EGRISS’ work is developed or conducted collaboratively with affected states and statistical experts from within its membership. The Secretariat therefore plays a critical role in coordinating, facilitating and supporting these collaborative efforts through a range of channels. The Associate Statistics and Data Analysis Officer will be part of the EGRISS Secretariat and support key activities, as outlined below, in order to help the Group successfully fulfill its mandate from the UNSC.

Purpose and Scope of Assignment

The Associate Statistics and Data Analysis Officer (EGRISS) will support the work of the Expert Group on Refugee, IDP and Statelessness Statistics (EGRISS). They will report to the Senior Statistics and Data Analysis Officer (EGRISS) and will work in close collaboration with other EGRISS Secretariat colleagues as well as members of the EGRISS Steering Committee and its broader membership.

Om stillingen




DI har en ambitiøs digital strategi, der skal bringe dem tættere på medlemmerne, understøtte vækst og sikre effektiv kommunikation og samarbejde på tværs. Som en del af dette og for at styrke Data & Automations Teamet søger DI en Lead Data Engineer.




Som Lead Data Engineer vil du være med til at opbygge en moderne dataplatform i DI. Du får mulighed for at være med i alle faser – fra analyse, design og udvikling til test, implementering og den måske vigtigste fase, forankringen i hverdagen. Du sætter den faglige retning ift. data engineering/dimensionel modellering, og viser at teori kan omsættes til praksis. Du kan skabe overblik på tværs, og ”tænker stort, men starter småt” med øje for, at få data ud at leve i forretningen ved at levere værdiskabende data og indsigter.




Afdelingen har ansvaret for dataprocessering og dataløsninger og er godt i gang med at opbygge en dataplatform på Microsoft Azure stacken – startende med et datavarehus og en række analytiske løsninger. Afdelingen har til ansvar at få teknologierne til at tale sammen ved at automatisere og strømline datapipelines.




Du får en nøglerolle, hvor du er med til at sætte retningen i afdelingen, som er Center of Excellence i forhold til dataplatformen. Du samarbejder tæt med forretningen om at levere værdiskabende data og indsigter gennem bl.a. selvbetjeningsløsninger. I den forbindelse vil du til dagligt være i tæt dialog med forretningen, hvor du også vil agere sparringspartner og indgå i dialog ift. opsætning af integration af data fra forskellige kildesystemer.




Derudover vil dit ansvarsområder bl.a være at:

Være drivende i at opbygge en moderne og mangfoldig dataplatform i DI.
Sætte den faglige retning ift. data engineering/dimensionel modellering, og viser at teori kan omsættes til praksis.
Skabe overblik på tværs, og ”tænker stort, men starter småt” med øje for, at få data ud at leve i forretningen ved at levere værdiskabende data og indsigter.
Du får en nøglerolle, hvor du er med til at sætte retningen i forhold til dataplatformen







Af arbejdsopgaver kan bl.a. nævnes:

Udarbejde tekniske løsningsforslag, såvel som at estimere opgaver og effektivt kommunikere det til forretningen
Designe, udvikle og implementere dataløsninger, primært til data warehouset
Designe, udvikle og vedligeholde dataplatformen og data pipelines
Bidrage til at udvikle en langsigtet strategi for dataplatformen
Integrere data fra en række kilder, og opbygning af datamodeller
Bidrage til tekniske og forretningsmæssige afklaringer af løsninger
Deltage i udviklings- og projektopgaver i forbindelse med optimering af processer og systemer på tværs af DI.




Om dig

Den ideelle kandidat brænder for data og udvikling og tør udfordre status quo og flirte med cloud teknologi og data arkitektur. Du har fire til otte års erfaring fra en lignende stilling, evt. fra et konsulenthus eller en brancheorganisation, hvor du har haft hands-on erfaring med opbygning af data løsninger. Du har en relevant akademisk baggrund formentlig fra CBS, KU eller ITU med særlig fokus på data. Du er serviceorienteret, hjælpsom og kan være bindeled mellem forretningen og it-specialister. Vi ser gerne at du er fagligt nysgerrig i forhold til nye tendenser og udviklingen inden for datavidenskab, herunder data services i Azure. Derudover arbejder du struktureret og selvstændigt med et analytisk mindset og en metodisk tilgang.




Vi ser gerne at du besidder følgende kvalifikationer:

Ekspert i ETL processen, SQL programmering og datamart modellering iflg. Kimball
Solid erfaring med agil udvikling, gerne med afsæt i Git platformen
Gode kommunikationsevner på både dansk og engelsk




Det er en fordel, men ikke et krav, hvis du også har erfaring med:

T-SQL og SQL Server automation rammeværk generelt set
Analytiske applikationer, gerne Microsoft Power BI
Microsoft Azure dataplatform (Infrastruktur)
Azure data factory




Derudover er du en person, der tager ansvar for at kvaliteten, af det der leveres, er høj. Du er god til at sætte dig ind i komplekse og fagligt tunge opgaver. Du er resultatorienteret og har stor handlekraft. Det er også vigtigt, at du er vedholdende, også når det kommer til at udvikle dig selv fagligt og personligt, da teamet har stort fokus på det gode kollegaskab, samt at være gode samarbejdspartnere for hele huset. Det er altså vigtigt, at du er i stand til at danne dig en helhedsforståelse af hele DI. Endelig er du en person som har både hjerte og hjerne med på job og er enig med teamet i, at et godt socialt arbejdsmiljø er en nødvendig del af det at gå på arbejde.

Kan du trives i en stor organisation med mange interessenter? Så kan du være den helt rette profil til vores ejendomsdatakontor.

Fremtidens ejendomsvurderinger baseres på nye og detaljerede data, som skal sikre ejendomsvurderinger – og dermed også ejendomsbeskatning – af høj kvalitet. Du og andre gode kollegaer skal være med til at styrke den samlede værdikæde fra vurderings- til beskatningsdata og levere et afgørende løft til den datamæssige modenhed i Vurderingsstyrelsen.

Hvad enten du har gjort dig erfaringer med data engineering og er på kig efter nye udfordringer, eller du er ny på arbejdsmarkedet med lyst til at specialisere dig i data engineering, så kan vi bruge dig.

Arbejde med komplekse datastrukturer og store datamængder
Du bliver en del af et nyt kontor med seks kolleger, der har ansvar for den forretningsmæssige udvikling af Skatteforvaltningens ejendomsdata lige fra kildedata til beskatning. Vi skal sammen sikre at styrelsens styringsdata er tilgængelige i den rette kvalitet, så styrelsen effektivt kan basere beslutninger og aktiviteter på data. Du kan se frem til at blive én ud af fire data engineers, som dagligt arbejder med leverancer af dataprodukter.

Du vil bidrage til datamodellering og håndtere komplekse datastrukturer og store datamængder. Det kræver tekniske og forretningsmæssige afklaringer, som du varetager professionelt, så du både forstår forretningen og de it-tekniske aspekter. Vi udvikler også mindre applikationer til eksempelvis sagsstyring. Herudover oplever vi ofte behov for ad hoc indhentning og sammensætning af data, når styrelsen hurtigt skal levere korrekte data, som grundlag for behandling af indkommende forespørgsler. Desuden skal du være med til at opbygge datafaglighed i resten af styrelsen.

God dataforståelse og lyst til tværgående samarbejde
Du kan både være nyuddannet med en relevant uddannelse fx indenfor it, samfundsøkonomi eller naturvidenskab eller have flere års relevant erfaring. Det vigtigste er, at du har god forståelse for at arbejde med data, og at du har lyst til at udvikle dig indenfor området.

For at trives i rollen kræver det, at du:


Evner at analysere og strukturere komplekse data- og forretningsmæssige problemstillinger
Har en procesorienteret tankegang, så du kan tænke hele processen fra dataindhentning, databehandling til levering af data igennem.
Er god til at formidle komplekst stof til interessenter, som ikke har samme datamæssige baggrund som dig.
Har en positiv tilgang til arbejdsopgaver og nye udfordringer. Du er grundig, ansvarsfuld og kan arbejde selvstændigt og effektivt.



Det er en fordel hvis du har arbejdet med Python, R, SQL, GIT.

Hvad kan vi tilbyde dig
Hvis du ønsker at dygtiggøre dig i at udvikle dataområdet i en stor og kompleks organisation, så er det her du skal søge. Du får mulighed for at bidrage til hvordan vi håndterer data management i Vurderingsstyrelsen og får mulighed for at påvirke, hvordan vi implementerer det. Samtidig får du erfaring med arbejdet i en politisk organisation og vil således være klædt godt på til dit det næste skridt i karrieren inden for data, digitalisering og offentlig forvaltning.

Du kan se frem til en fagligt udfordrende stilling på en spændende og samfundsvigtig arbejdsplads, hvor vi tilbyder alsidige og udfordrende arbejdsopgaver i et uhøjtideligt fællesskab.

Samtidig er du med til at opbygge et nyt kontor, hvor vi vægter den enkeltes bidrag højt og du kan dermed sætte dit præg på områdets udvikling og styrelsens måde at arbejde med data på.

Kontakt og ansættelsesvilkår
Ansøgning med CV og eksamenspapirer bedes sendt via linket ”Søg stillingen” senest den 24. oktober.

Hvis du har spørgsmål til stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte kontorchef Rune Bonnerup på telefon 72 37 02 45.

Der kan indgå en logisk test og en personanalyse i ansættelsesforløbet. Der vil forud for ansættelsen blive indhentet straffeattest.

Du bliver ansat på overenskomstvilkår i henhold til den til enhver tid gældende overenskomst for akademikere i staten (AC), overenskomst for kontorfunktionærer, laboranter og it-medarbejdere (HK) eller overenskomst for fuldmægtige m.fl. (DTS) i Skatteministeriet.

Ansættelsesområdet er Skatteministeriet med tilhørende institutioner. Dit arbejdssted bliver Lindevangs Allé 8-12, Frederiksberg.

’Vi sikrer, at boligejerne får en mere retvisende og gennemskuelig ejendomsvurdering’

Vurderingsstyrelsen varetager alle forhold om ejendomsvurdering og beskatning af ejendomme.

Fremtidens vurderinger bliver baseret på nye og detaljerede data. Det skal sikre, at borgere og virksomheder kan have tillid til, at de bliver beskattet på et korrekt grundlag. Vores værdier er ansvar, udsyn, faglighed og samarbejde.

Vi er en arbejdsplads med mange forskellige fagligheder. De er alle i spil i dagligdagen, hvor vi lægger vægt på et godt arbejdsmiljø og en stærk samarbejdskultur, hvor alle trives, tager ansvar og bidrager til den fælles opgave.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

We are looking for a Data Analyst that is passionate about metrics and telling the stories behind the data. We have several roles open across different teams (grocery, loyalty, restaurants). Data Analysts at Deliveroo report into our data science management team.

You will be a professional in insights storytelling, communication and visualisation and know how to create action from metrics. Crafting effective intelligent benchmarks, understanding performance, caring about data quality, enabling automation and creating phenomenal visualisations and stories are things that drive you.

What you'll be doing



Work closely with commercial stakeholders to create value and business impact through better data availability, visualisation and analysis
Discover, analyse, and interpret trends or patterns in complex datasets to perform ad-hoc analyses and deliver insights to the executive team and senior management
Understand key drivers of the business and provide data driven guidance on key levers
Identify and specify data needs and quality requirements and work closely with Analytics Engineers to ensure data is available, accurate and corresponds to the business needs
Consolidate and distribute best analytical practices from different teams and countries



Requirements



Experience identifying the root cause of problems, assessing risks/impacts and determining and implementing effective solutions.
A good understanding of querying in SQL and understanding of database structure - you'll be expected to be able to extract the data you need for your analysis.
Compelling story-telling skills, and an eye for powerful visualisations - you'll need to translate your findings for all levels of stakeholder (business and technical)
Good knowledge of Excel/GSheets - depending on the task, there is a good chance that this is where some of your exploratory analysis will take place. Being comfortable with pivot tables and functions will be essential.
Developer experience with a data visualisation tool (Looker, Tableau, Periscope)

About the Programme

Our Career Returner Programme offers a paid placement of 12 months, starting in March 2025, with the possibility of a permanent role at the end of the programme.

You will receive coaching support from Career Returners to help you to transition successfully back into the workplace. Flexible working options are available and you will also be paired with a Bank buddy.

These roles will be located in the Bank’s Leeds city centre location. We aim for all colleagues to spend half of their time in the office, with a minimum expectation of 40% across the month. Subject to that minimum requirement, individuals and managers should work together to find what works best for them and their team.

Who Are We Looking For

The Programme is aimed at people who have had a career break of two or more years at the start of the programme in March 2025.

You must be willing to learn across a broad range of disciplines, have good analytical and problem-solving skills, combined with the ability to process, interpret and question large amounts of complex data, and work collaboratively as part of a dedicated team. The ability to communicate your findings effectively is also vital, both in person and in writing, as well as the ability to manage other important priorities/projects alongside your day-to-day job. Professional work experience is a must, because you’ll need the ability to influence and operate at a senior level.

The right skills are more important than the right background. Financial experience is not essential for all roles, though may be beneficial. The current Bank of England PRA teams include people from a range of backgrounds such as science, technology, government, civil service and the military.

About The Roles

These data roles are offered in both our ARTIS & SRO Directorates. Across all roles you will be involved in varied and high-profile work, and you’ll have many different responsibilities. You’ll have the opportunity to contribute to or lead work feeding into a number of key PRA projects and will have autonomy in implementing solutions that will support the PRA in its multi-year programme to deliver greater efficiency and effectiveness in the PRA through tools, technology, data, processes and skills. You’ll be helping drive forward the growth, awareness and uptake of tools and technologies to improve a variety of internal business functions related to financial supervision and regulation. These roles will give you the opportunity to liaise with colleagues across the PRA and the wider Bank.

ARTIS

The Authorisations, RegTech and International Supervision (ARTIS) Directorate within the PRA is formed of:


The Authorisations Division, which deals with regulatory transactions where firms apply to carry out PRA regulated activities or make changes to the activities they undertake.
The RegTech, Data and Innovation Division
The four divisions responsible for the supervision, as a host regulator, of the UK activities of international banks, custodians and designated investment firms headquartered in over 50 overseas jurisdictions – including some of the world’s highest profile firms.


The successful candidates will join the RegTech, Data and Innovation Division (RDID), which works to deliver against the PRA Strategic Review objective to make the most of data and technology, consistent with the wider Bank’s Strategic Priority 7 to modernise the Bank’s ways of working. In September 2021, Prudential Regulation Committee agreed a multi-year programme to ‘deliver a step change in the PRA’s efficiency, effectiveness, and data culture by 2026, through phased investment in tools, technology, processes and skills. Since then, RDID has been working hard with colleagues across the PRA and in the wider Bank to help ensure we are equipped to deliver against that ambition. In 2022, we laid the foundations and multi-year forward plan in the PRA 2026 strategic data roadmap, as well as rolling out early tools and platforms. In 2023, we entered delivery mode for the agreed priority projects within that roadmap. Roles will sit with one of RDID’s four teams: Data Governance Team; Digital Transformation Team; Operational Strategy & Delivery Team; Technical Capabilities Team.

SRO

Strategy, Risk & Ops (SRO) is central to the delivery of the PRA’s strategy, we partner with business and central functions of the Bank to ensure the PRA is equipped to deliver its objectives and to enable the PRA to respond to changes in risk dynamically. The Directorate is split into four divisions, and successful candidates will join Data, Systems, Change & Operations Division (DSCO). The division’s mission is to steer and deliver PRA change, influence the regulatory data agenda and drive the use of strategic business systems and data across the wider Bank. DSCO owns the PRA’s BAU Technology relationship and delivers and supports the PRA’s most important change programmes & systems.

About The Work

As a data professional within the PRA, you will support the development of advanced analytics through deployment of tools to improve a variety of internal business functions related to financial supervision and regulation.

You will support a number of key PRA data projects and will have autonomy to shape the development of new analytical tools. The successful candidate will collaborate and build relationships inclusively with end-users including supervisors of banks and insurers to understand their needs and ensure tools meet those needs. You will help drive forward the growth, awareness and uptake of RegTech and SupTech tools and technologies across the PRA. This may include presenting ideas or explaining new products/tools to both senior committees and frontline supervision.

About The Skillset

We have a number of roles in both ARTIS & SRO and we’ll aim to match you to a role that builds on your strengths.

You’ll enjoy analysing problems and be open to discussing and debating issues. You strive for clarity and are able to quickly understand differing views and suggest paths to progress amidst competing wants. No two projects will be the same and you’ll often find yourself working on cross functional projects and teams.

This variety also means that good communication skills are vital. From being able to articulate your team’s mission to effectively communicating and collaborating with your respective stakeholders in the delivery of work, to building relationships with end-users to understand their needs and liaising extensively with other teams to coordinate successful delivery of projects and business change initiatives. The mixture of high-profile work and complex issues means you’ll have plenty of opportunities to develop both your technical and interpersonal skills.

The role holders will be expected to demonstrate that they are able to increase the impact, complexity and autonomy of their working assignments during their time in the role. This means that the roles need a self-starter able to autonomously collaborate with colleagues at different levels and specialisms.

Minimum Criteria

Leadership: You can lead individuals and teams to achieve common goals through lateral leadership and can engage with a wide range of experts from very different backgrounds.
Prioritisation and time management: You possess excellent prioritisation and time management skills as the nature of the work means that you may often be working on multiple pieces with different stakeholders at the same time.
Technical background or equivalent: You will have experience with data analytics and a passion for leveraging technology to drive operational efficiency.

Professional work experience is a must, because you’ll need the ability to influence and operate at a senior level.<br><br>The right skills are more important than the right background. Financial experience is not essential for all roles, though may be beneficial. The current Bank of England PRA teams include people from a range of backgrounds such as science, technology, government, civil service and the military.<br><br><strong>About The Roles<br><br></strong>These data roles are offered in both our ARTIS &amp; SRO Directorates.

You’ll be helping drive forward the growth, awareness and uptake of tools and technologies to improve a variety of internal business functions related to financial supervision and regulation. These roles will give you the opportunity to liaise with colleagues across the PRA and the wider Bank.<br><br><strong>ARTIS<br><br></strong>The Authorisations, RegTech and International Supervision (ARTIS) Directorate within the PRA is formed of:<br><br><ul><li>The Authorisations Division, which deals with regulatory transactions where firms apply to carry out PRA regulated activities or make changes to the activities they undertake.</li><li>The RegTech, Data and Innovation Division</li><li>The four divisions responsible for the supervision, as a host regulator, of the UK activities of international banks, custodians and designated investment firms headquartered in over 50 overseas jurisdictions – including some of the world’s highest profile firms. <br><br></li></ul>The successful candidates will join the RegTech, Data and Innovation Division (RDID), which works to deliver against the PRA Strategic Review objective to make the most of data and technology, consistent with the wider Bank’s Strategic Priority 7 to modernise the Bank’s ways of working. In September 2021, Prudential Regulation Committee agreed a multi-year programme to ‘deliver a step change in the PRA’s efficiency, effectiveness, and data culture by 2026, through phased investment in tools, technology, processes and skills. Since then, RDID has been working hard with colleagues across the PRA and in the wider Bank to help ensure we are equipped to deliver against that ambition. In 2022, we laid the foundations and multi-year forward plan in the PRA 2026 strategic data roadmap, as well as rolling out early tools and platforms. In 2023, we entered delivery mode for the agreed priority projects within that roadmap.

UK Deposit Directorate Overview

The UK Deposit Takers Supervision Directorate (UKDT) is responsible for the supervision of over 600 banks, building societies and credit unions.

The directorate is split into the following six divisions which focus on delivering effective and proportionate prudential supervision: Global Systemically Important Banks Division (G-SIBs); Domestic Systemically Important Banks Division (D-SIBs); Mid-Tier Banks Division (MTB); New & Specialist Banks Division (NSB); Large Mutuals and Supervisory Specialists Division (LMASSD); Mutuals, Policy and Resilience Division (MPRD).

Our teams work together as one UKDT to promote the safety and soundness of all UK deposit takers.

Within that, the LMASSD has three areas with different responsibilities:


Prudential supervision of the largest UK building societies
UKDT Specialists teams offer cross-directorate capital, liquidity, and credit support.
Technical Analysis and Supervisory Supports (TASS) team provides specialist data analytics and other cross-firm thematic work.


Team Overview

The TASS team supports UKDT to deliver effective supervision by enabling firm-level, cross-firm and sector-wide views of risk and key data and co-ordinating UKDT’s response to crisis events.

TASS is part of a Hub & Spoke network of data scientists, led by the PRA’s RegTech, Data and Innovation Division (RDID). The aim of the network is to help deliver the PRA 2026 strategic data roadmap and transform the use of data in the PRA. TASS collaborates closely with RDID on cross data science and analytics projects, data strategy and innovation.

Job Description

An exciting opportunity has arisen for a Data Scientist within the TASS team. In this role, you will lead and assist the development of advanced analytics through the deployment of data science and artificial intelligence/machine learning techniques. The aim is to improve a variety of internal business functions related to financial supervision and regulation . In addition, you will contribute to the PRA and Bank-wide agendas on improving data quality at firms, increasing digital skills, and embedding AI/ML techniques throughout the PRA’s analytical suite. The role offers a fantastic opportunity to improve your understanding of finance and regulation.

You will coordinate and feed into several key data projects in UKDT and the PRA to ensure the safety and soundness of the firms we supervise . You will have autonomy in implementing the best solutions, including training end users and the development of new analytical tools.
