Gemma was founded in early 2020 by two data enthusiasts. Ever since we have helped over 60 companies to become more data-driven and successful. We have a fun, honest, and inclusive work environment. We are always looking for data-minded people we can learn from.

Tasks

You drive the usage of data for our clients, showing and facilitating the value that can be created with data. People love working with you because you find the right balance between quality and speed. You are the communication link between technology and business, and also between C-Level and operational team members. You feel comfortable communicating with all types of stakeholders. Having senior responsibilities, we expect you to build connections with your colleagues and share your knowledge with the team. You have the opportunity to work on difficult problems while helping startups and SMEs to make well-informed decisions based on data. Note that this is a non-remote role in Berlin.

You have the opportunity to work on difficult problems while helping startups and SMEs to make well-informed decisions based on data.

Responsibilities


You understand the most important business KPIs easily after speaking to responsible stakeholders, being a high-quality sparring partner
Currently, the data consultant role is split between analytics engineers and the founder - you shape the role and answer the question of when it makes sense to have dedicated data consultant resources on a project
Currently, the data consultant role is rather reactive - over time, you add proactiveness to the role and act as a sparring partner in how to sell this new role


Requirements

We believe in a good mixture of experience and upside in our team. For this role, related experience is required in addition to a proof of trajectory.

Besides That We Are Looking For The Following


Experience in a fast-paced environment driving projects and track record of managing stakeholders with a good balance between quality and speed
Ability to leverage both SQL and visualization tools to generate insights for our clients
Strong stakeholder-adjusted communication in English in writing and speaking
Business Fluency (C2 or native) in German
Preferred: You have strong expertise in one or more core data areas (e.g. product/marketing/operational/etc. analytics)


Benefits

We are located in Berlin, close to Nordbahnhof. We are currently 17 colleagues and will grow to 23 colleagues in the next 12 to 18 months. Other perks include:


We are a hybrid company that meets in the office twice a week - one common office day and one flexible day
We allow for intra-EU workcations for up to 3 months a year (extra-EU workcations also if this is allowed)
We have an honest, inclusive work environment and want to nurture this environment
We don’t compromise on equipment - a powerful Laptop, extra screens, and all the tools you need to be effective
We will surround you with great people who love to solve (mostly data) riddles
We believe in efficient working hours rather than long working hours - we focus on the output rather than the input
We learn and share during meetups, lunch & learn sessions and are open to further initiatives
We pay a market-friendly salary and we additionally distribute at least 20% of profits to our employees
We are fast-growing and have technology at our core, yet we do not rely on a VC and operate profitably
We have a great yearly offsite event that brings us all together for a full week, enjoying good food, and having a good time (2021: Austria, 2022: Czech Republic, 2023: Germany)

Contract: 12 month Fixed Term Contract




Closing Date: 9th of October 2024. Please note, we may close vacancies early where we receive significant numbers of applications, so don’t delay!




As the nation’s leading pub, cider and beer company and the name behind a host of brilliant brands, we’re looking for equally brilliant people to help us on our journey to building a better future.




There’s so much more to HEINEKEN than meets the eye and right now, we’re looking for a new Data Analyst to join our Digital & Technology team!




About the role

The Data Analyst is responsible for maintaining and gathering data requirements for HEINEKEN UK (HUK). You’ll play a leading role in ensuring the global defined data requirements are understood, sourced, assessed and made fit for purpose.




This role will sit in the Data Management team and prioritise the delivery of frameworks, policies and ways of working by utilising data management tools to increase the quality and structure of HUK data.




So, what will you be doing? Here are some of the key accountabilities;

Lead data management requirements in the UK from start to finish, including planning, execution and validation across data exploration, discovery, cataloguing, governance & quality management.
Develop and execute modelling and cleansing plans, including mapping, data migration, transformation, and cleansing activities to support digital products
Collaborate with stakeholders to identify project requirements and define data management goals and objectives.
Evaluate legacy systems and data sources to determine the scope and complexity of the migration and cleansing effort.




Who we’re looking for?

We’re looking for a team player with a keen aye for detail! Ideally you’ll have an understanding of how data is used within a business and it’s impact on the wider company. You’ll often need to facilitate communication between business leaders and the tech teams, so strong communication skills are key.




If you;

Have 5+ years of management experience in a data management-related role.
Understand data management capabilities– especially around profiling, cleansing and data migration
Can effectively manage multiple projects and deliverables.
Have relevant knowledge of data management frameworks
Ideally experience in Supply Chain data




This could be the role for you!




Our ways of working

Our office sites operate a hybrid model. You’ll spend Tuesdays, Thursdays and one other day in the office and two days from home, although but you’re more than welcome to come and work from the office on those days too.




We’re currently gearing up for an exciting move! In 2025, we’ll be relocating from our current location at Broadway Park (on the outskirts of Edinburgh) to a modern, flexible working space in the heart of the city centre.




The move to our new home at 6 St Andrew Square is expected to take place in the second quarter of 2025, subject to detailed planning and relevant approvals. The site will have great transport links and will be just a five minute walk from Waverley station.




So stay tuned, and once you're onboard you'll have access to a SharePoint site with further details during the transition period to the new location.




The Good Stuff!

In addition to your base salary, you’ll also receive:

An annual bonus
Company funded Private Medical Healthcare
Double matched pension (up to 10%)
35 days holiday
A monthly case of our delicious ciders and beers! (low and no alcohol options available)
Comprehensive Opportunities to develop.




You’ll also get the opportunity to get involved with one of our colleague networks where groups of colleagues from all over the business work together to ensure we’re always working towards being a diverse and inclusive company.




The application

If you like what you’ve read and want to explore this opportunity further, please apply before the closing date listed at the top of the advert.




Please note, we may close vacancies early where we receive significant numbers of applications, so don’t delay!




If you need any adjustments made to support your application, for example if you require information in different formats, or if you have any accessibility issues, then we’re more than happy to review our processes – please feel free to get in touch with us as recruitment@heineken.co.uk.




In all likelihood the ideal candidate for this role won’t meet every single requirement in this advert, in fact we all need the opportunity to grow and develop in role. We understand some applicants are less likely to apply to jobs unless they feel they meet every single qualification. The team at HEINEKEN would encourage you to submit an application if the advert has piqued your interest rather than ruling yourself out based on any self-limiting beliefs.

We’ve 150 years of brewing history and are proud of this legacy. Yet we’re sure our best days are ahead of us. Every one of our colleagues has a role to play as we dream big, set bold ambitions, and push the boundaries. We support colleagues on this journey with development opportunities and unique experiences to help them reach their full potential.

Scalexperts have partnered with a London based business who, as part of the beginning of a large scale data transformation, are looking to hire a Data Analyst on a permanent basis. Various departments within the business are keen to do more with their data, with the initial focus of the role involving the development and implementation of various dashboards within PowerBI. The role will also involve some data analysis with SQL, and requirements gathering from cross-functional teams - Marketing, Operations, Technology etc. The end goal of this initial phase is for a self-serve reporting capability to be built. The longer term vision for this role is to provide strategic analysis that aids in decision making whilst also ensuring a high level of data quality and governance across the company.




Although this role involves both analysis and technical work, the emphasis is on the analysis and reporting side with roughly 20% of the role involving SQL coding.




Key Responsibilities:

Working closely with the Head of Data to drive the implementation of the data strategy
Pushing the adoption of PowerBI, taking existing reports/tools and migrating them onto PowerBI using trusted data
Analyse the existing SQL database and ensure that it is fit for purpose, making alterations and recommendations where appropriate
Build frameworks with teams company wide to ensure that requirements for data and reporting are documented
Build strong relationships across the company to ensure the data strategy continues to align with the business strategy and aid in insights driven decision making
Ensure that the data the wider business has access to is of high quality and can be trusted




Key Skills Required:

3-6 years in a data/reporting/insights role, delivering analysis on how a business gathers, reports and stores its data
Previous experience of working with data from external-facing teams ie. sales/marketing
Experience with PowerBI and creating dashboards from scratch
Knowledge of SQL coding - ability to use stored procedures etc
Able to translate technical/data concepts to non-technical stakeholders
Experience presenting findings to stakeholders at all level - this transformation is being closely followed by multiple senior figures within the organisation
Comfortable in taking ownership - the data team is in it's infancy so there will be an onus on being able to adapt, working within a certain amount of ambiguity and providing value to the business despite a low level of data maturity
Experience within a SaaS/B2B company would be highly advantageous




This company are based in central London and operate a hybrid working model with 3 days/week in the office.

Compensation is one of the key levers for attracting and retaining great talent, yet most companies are struggling to get it right. They simply have no choice but to rely on poor data and unsophisticated tools for their pay decisions. That’s why we created Ravio.

We help some of the world’s most innovative and ambitious companies build stronger teams and reach their goals through better compensation. Our goal is to bring compensation into the modern age by building the ultimate real-time compensation solution. We’re passionate about ensuring everyone is paid what they deserve, no matter their background or circumstances. We believe that when compensation is done right, everyone wins.

Ravio is growing fast, which means you can too. Joining a startup in the early days and scaling it into a global product is one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences a career can offer. If that sounds exciting to you, you’re in the right place.

The Role

Our Operations team acts as the guardian of Ravio’s core benchmarking product - the foundation of our business. We are not only striving to build the world’s largest real-time compensation benchmarking database, but also the best. This means we need to set a new standard when it comes to the quality and consistency of our underlying benchmarking data. This is why our operations team exists.

Benchmarking Ops springs into action the moment a new customer starts onboarding with Ravio. The team oversees the onboarding process from start to finish and is responsible for ensuring that each customer’s data is standardised, anonymised and mapped to our internal framework with an incredibly high level of precision. The team also monitors and upholds data integrity over the course of a customer’s lifecycle with Ravio and works with multiple cross-functional teams to build and improve internal tools and processes.

Working in our Operations team requires a combination of robust analytical skills and strong business acumen. This is a cross-functional job, so being able to communicate clearly and work with a diverse group of stakeholders effectively is key. You also need to be very structured and process-driven in order to succeed in this role.

If this sounds like you and you are ready to help us build a category-defining company with global ambitions, we’d love to hear from you.

Analyse customer datasets to ensure data completeness and integrity and enrich customer-supplied information with external data to improve signal strength
Validate and fine-tune the results of Ravio’s algorithmic job levelling process, ensuring the data is mapped consistently against our proprietary framework

Work cross-functionally with Ravio’s Data Science, Product, and Customer Success teams to build and continuously improve Ravio’s internal processes with the aim of achieving industry-leading data quality and integrity levels as well as delivering great customer experiences


Requirements


Structured thinker who enjoys working with data and has great attention to detail
Strong problem-solving skills and an entrepreneurial mindset
Strong prioritisation and organisational skills
Team player who thrives in a high-growth environment and embraces change
Desire to learn the ins and outs of compensation benchmarking and how Ravio’s technology can help
Advanced knowledge of SQL or general technical skills are a plus


Compensation & Benefits


Level P2: £35,000 - £45,000
Company ownership (everyone gets a meaningful equity stake in Ravio)
25 days paid holiday + bank holidays + 4 wellness days (take them anytime, no questions asked!)

Compensation is one of the key levers for attracting and retaining great talent, yet most companies are struggling to get it right. They simply have no choice but to rely on poor data and unsophisticated tools for their pay decisions. That’s why we created Ravio.

We help some of the world’s most innovative and ambitious companies build stronger teams and reach their goals through better compensation. Our goal is to bring compensation into the modern age by building the ultimate real-time compensation solution. We’re passionate about ensuring everyone is paid what they deserve, no matter their background or circumstances. We believe that when compensation is done right, everyone wins.

Ravio is growing fast, which means you can too. Joining a startup in the early days and scaling it into a global product is one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences a career can offer. If that sounds exciting to you, you’re in the right place.

The Role

Our Operations team acts as the guardian of Ravio’s core benchmarking product - the foundation of our business. We are not only striving to build the world’s largest real-time compensation benchmarking database, but also the best. This means we need to set a new standard when it comes to the quality and consistency of our underlying benchmarking data. This is why our operations team exists.

Benchmarking Ops springs into action the moment a new customer starts onboarding with Ravio. The team oversees the onboarding process from start to finish and is responsible for ensuring that each customer’s data is standardised, anonymised and mapped to our internal framework with an incredibly high level of precision. The team also monitors and upholds data integrity over the course of a customer’s lifecycle with Ravio and works with multiple cross-functional teams to build and improve internal tools and processes.

Working in our Operations team requires a combination of robust analytical skills and strong business acumen. This is a cross-functional job, so being able to communicate clearly and work with a diverse group of stakeholders effectively is key. You also need to be very structured and process-driven in order to succeed in this role.

If this sounds like you and you are ready to help us build a category-defining company with global ambitions, we’d love to hear from you.

Validate and fine-tune the results of Ravio’s algorithmic job levelling process, ensuring the data is mapped consistently against our proprietary framework

Work cross-functionally with Ravio’s Data Science, Product, and Customer Success teams to build and continuously improve Ravio’s internal processes with the aim of achieving industry-leading data quality and integrity levels as well as delivering great customer experiences


Requirements


Structured thinker who enjoys working with data and has great attention to detail
Strong problem-solving skills and an entrepreneurial mindset
Strong prioritisation and organisational skills
Team player who thrives in a high-growth environment and embraces change
Desire to learn the ins and outs of compensation benchmarking and how Ravio’s technology can help

Sharegain began with one question: If the largest institutions solely exercise the right to lend their stocks, bonds, and ETFs, what would it take to unlock this revenue opportunity for every investor?




Our team of experts in the UK, US and Israel built the solution: a platform that empowers online brokers, private banks, and wealth managers to offer securities lending to their clients. We call it SLaaS: Securities Lending as a Service. It’s a fully digital, customizable, end-to-end solution that automates front- and back-office operations. Institutions and investors are now free to earn more from what they own.




Every Sharegainer has their own backstory, but we all share an ambition to do things differently – bigger, better, and greater. Together we’re on a mission to democratize capital markets by building a more liquid world. The more we share, the more we all gain.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Almost every new home in the province is covered by a new home warranty. Tarion ensures consumer protection by providing free tools, guides and resources to help homeowners understand their builder’s warranty and navigate warranty claims with confidence.

Develop required reports that includes data sets, summaries, visualization tools (dashboards, graphs) and analysis




Provide continuous support and assistance with reporting needs to different departments on an on-going basis

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Transportation Specialist - Data Analytics

J0924-0594




Vaughan is a city on the move. With a downtown core rising from the ground – the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre, a state-of-the-art hospital opening its doors in 2021 – the Cortellucci Vaughan Hospital, and a bustling subway, exciting projects are transforming the community. Be a part of something amazing and build your career at the City of Vaughan.




The City of Vaughan is an equal opportunity employer serving one of the fastest-growing municipalities in Canada, we are an organization committed to diversity and inclusivity, providing a thriving work environment, excellent benefits, learning and growth opportunities and a place where collaboration and teamwork are fostered.

Excellence demands brilliant personalities, visionary thinking and a passion for public service. Vaughan is your place to grow.




Position Overview




Travel is an essential part of our daily lives, whether it’s commuting to work, running errands, or visiting family in another city. We navigate our routes using various modes of transportation: cars, walking, scooters, bikes, buses, subways, electric vehicles, rideshares, or airplanes—often combining several of these.

As we consider how communities move, the complexity of transportation planning becomes evident. It involves conceptualizing space and managing the intricate details of moving people from point A to point B safely and efficiently. Transportation planners must also ensure equity for all system users. To manage this complexity, planners rely heavily on data.




The Transportation Specialist - Data Analytics analyzes and interprets transportation data, providing technical advice, and supporting the advancement of the Vaughan Transportation Plan (VTP). Responsibilities include reviewing transportation data sets for Secondary Plans, New Community Areas, Intensification Areas, Focused Area studies, and other growth areas. The specialist will also update and maintain the transportation data monitoring program and network maps, conduct research, and support the city-wide travel demand forecasting model.




The ideal candidate will have expertise in data collection and analysis and a solid understanding of transportation planning principles.




Qualifications and Experience




• Three (3) year College Diploma in Civil Engineering Technology - Transportation or University Degree in Civil or Transportation Engineering or University Degree in Urban Planning or related field or an approved equivalent combination of education and experience. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be considered.




• Minimum five (5) years of experience in a transportation planning field.




• Detailed knowledge of transportation analysis principles, techniques, methodology and software packages, in some of the following areas: such as travel demand forecasting (EMME, Aimsun, Visum), traffic analysis and microsimulation (Synchro/Simtraffic, Aimsun, Vistro, Vissim, Dynamec), pedestrian flow analysis (Legion, MassMotion, Viswalk) or others.




• Proficiency with travel demand forecasting software.




• Basic proficiency in geospatial data, mapping and analytics software. Expertise would be an asset.




• Thorough understanding of transportation data collection practices and procedures and ability to organize, manage and analyze complex transportation datasets. Knowledge of data science platforms/languages such as R, Python, Tableau, etc. would be an asset.




• Demonstrated ability to address complex problems, utilizing innovative solutions where warranted.




• Strong project and time management skills to meet program objectives and tight deadlines.




• Excellent verbal and written communication skills to convey technical analysis, methodologies and results to a non-technical audience.




• Demonstrated ability to work both independently as well as collaboratively in a team environment.




• Knowledge of the Environmental Assessment Act, the Planning Act and other related government, labour, employment and human rights legislation.




• Valid Ontario Class ‘G’ driver’s license in good standing and reliable vehicle to utilize on corporate business.




If you are an energetic person who is interested in bringing your knowledge and passion to the City of Vaughan, please visit our website to apply online by October 31, 2024.
