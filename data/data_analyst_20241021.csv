Current Major Projects


Supporting, Mobilizing, and Accelerating Research for Tuberculosis Elimination (SMART4TB) Technical Area 5 (TB Vaccine Readiness) Consortium Studies – This USAID-funded project is conducting mixed-methods research in up to six high TB burden countries to evaluate current levels of, and factors influencing, demand and acceptance of new TB vaccines targeting adults and adolescents. It also assesses the readiness of health facilities and health systems to introduce and sustain the delivery of such vaccines. Data collection will commence in Kenya and South Africa this year, with plans to expand to up to four additional countries over the next four years. Key skills of interest include international field site management, data management, data analysis, and preference research methods (e.g., discrete choice experiments [DCE] and best-worst scaling [BWS]). If desired, the project offers opportunities to engage in qualitative research data collection and analysis, and to apply participatory research approaches to co-design dissemination products for diverse in-country stakeholders, integrating the formative vaccine data.
Investigating a Novel Targeted Rollout Strategy for Adult and Adolescent TB Vaccines for Maximum Impact (INTRO-TB-VAX Study) - This Gates-funded project is conducting research in up to three high TB burden countries to: (1) identify the highest-yield venues for potential vaccine delivery (e.g., health facilities, schools, markets, bars, prisons, churches, and other community settings); (2) prioritize key barriers to delivering TB vaccines at these venues—at both individual and structural levels—that must be addressed before vaccine availability; and (3) describe the implementation conditions under which novel TB vaccines are likely to achieve the greatest impact and cost-effectiveness. The project will begin data collection in Zambia early next year, with plans to expand to up to two additional countries over the following year. Skills of interest include international field site management, data management, data analysis, and preference research methods (e.g., discrete choice experiments [DCE] and best-worst scaling [BWS]). If desired, the project offers opportunities to engage in qualitative research data collection and analysis, costing data collection, and impact and cost-effectiveness modeling.

Job Description And Duties

Individuals interested in applying for this vacancy must have eligibility. If you are new to state service or need to gain eligibility to this classification, please click PURA V to open the examination bulletin and follow the instructions on “How to apply”.

The examination is a separate process from applying for this vacancy. Please be sure to follow all instructions for each process.

Virtual interviews via web portals or phone may be offered as deemed appropriate and feasible by the hiring manager – standard in-person interviews will still be offered if conditions permit.

The Energy Division is seeking an experienced senior-level analyst to oversee the implementation of the Commission’s data access policies. Customer energy usage data, and access to that data by non-utility entities, is a growing issue that impacts several programs and initiatives that the Commission oversees. This is a high visibility position that will require briefing Commissioners and advisors and working closely with other Energy Division staff, interested parties and consultants, if hired for technical support.

Under the general direction of the program and project supervisor, the individual filling this PURA V position will support Commission policies concerning non-utility access to customer energy usage data and other personally identifiable information. Specifically, the incumbent will be the lead analyst to resolve customer data privacy and access issues. This includes oversight of utility provision of customer data/information to third parties who seek such information either for individual customers or in aggregate. These third parties include government agencies, academic institutions, Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs) and entities that are known as ‘distributed energy resources” or “DER” providers who need the data to implement customer demand-side programs. The incumbent would also be responsible for overseeing utility data access mechanisms or portals for third parties to ensure that they are operating as intended. To the extent the Commission modifies its data access policies, the incumbent would be the lead analyst for those efforts. The incumbent may also be responsible for representing the Division in California Independent System Operator or California Energy Commission stakeholder processes where customer usage data is a relevant issue. The incumbent could also serve as a resource on other data issues such as improving standardization and efficiency in Energy Division’s processes of collecting, storing and displaying data it receives from the utilities. The incumbent may also assist with developing processes and policy recommendations related to data access and data sharing as it relates to the Concurrent Application System (CAS), which is currently being developed by Energy Division staff to comply with the requirements of Senate Bill (SB) 1208 (2022).

CPUC encourages a hybrid workplace model that is designed to accommodate the full range of workplace preferences, to the extent that individual job duties allow. For most Energy Division positions, staff can opt to work largely from home or in an approved alternate work location or work primarily or entirely in a CPUC office. In all cases, though, occasional in-person attendance will be required for onboarding and orientation, certain trainings, team building activities, and collaborative meetings, as specified by management. All State employees must reside in California.

Please visit Energy Division's recruitment page located here: https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/about-cpuc/divisions/energy-division/energy-division-recruiting for further job opportunities.

We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive team and strongly encourage applications from individuals of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities to join our team.

You act like an owner and have a desire to lead. You’ve likely been a data engineer at traditional companies but you’re ready to be the first data hire at a startup.




Replicate is a complex business and we need solid data infrastructure to guide it. You’ll own this infrastructure.




We’re looking for the right person, not just someone who checks boxes, so you don’t need to satisfy all of these things. But you probably have some of these qualities:

Experience building from scratch. You’ve set up data stacks and pipelines, not just worked with an existing system.
Expert at SQL and other common analytics tools. You can turn a question into a query faster and more reliably than GPT-4.
You think like a software engineer. You put things in GitHub, use continuous integration, give things good names, make it consistent with how we do things in the product. We want to create data systems that integrate with the rest of our systems, not their own silo with a different culture.
Fast and scrappy. You know how to get 80% of the value with 20% of the effort.
Experience with usage-based businesses. They’re much more complicated.
You like helping people. You’re not going to live in a cave, you’re going to be building the tools that make our finance, product, infrastructure, and growth teams successful. You’re not just going to give them numbers, you’re also going to help them tell a story about those numbers.




You’ll be working from our San Francisco office for this role.
