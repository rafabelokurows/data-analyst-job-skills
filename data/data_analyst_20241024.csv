We have more than 500 data specialists, and our knowledge portfolio contains a variety of data-related specialisations involving data solutions in almost every relevant technology, both in the cloud and otherwise. At Solita, you will be part of a team that is courageous and passionate, but at the same time easy-going.

We are focused on fast change and impactful technologies that make such change possible. We employ 2000+ top-notch tech professionals across the Nordics and West Europe, of which almost 80 in Belgium.

While we don’t have an open position right now, we are proactively building a pool of qualified candidates for future Data Analyst roles. By joining our talent pool, you'll be among the first we reach out to when a suitable opportunity becomes available!

At Solita, our focus is on empowering our clients to make data-driven decisions through insightful analysis and effective data visualizations. We take a technology-agnostic approach, selecting the right tools based on the client’s specific needs rather than being tied to any one platform. While Power BI and Tableau are common in our projects due to their robust capabilities, the key lies in transforming data into actionable insights that truly impact business outcomes.

What do our Data Consultants do?

At Solita, we believe that data tells a story, and our job is to help our clients understand that story. We don’t stick to just one tool or technology; instead, we focus on what works best for each client, tailoring our approach to their specific needs. While we often use tools like Power BI and Tableau, what matters most to us is how well we can help our clients make sense of their data and use it to make informed decisions.

In This Role

Your main focus will be on helping clients translate raw data into meaningful insights. You’ll work closely with them to understand their challenges, dive deep into their data, and create visualizations that don’t just look good but actually help solve real business problems. You’ll also have a network of over 600 data and integration experts to lean on, so you’ll always have support when you need it.

We’re Looking For Someone Who


Loves working with data: Whether it’s through Power BI, Tableau, or another tool, you’re passionate about making data easy to understand and act on.
Thinks like an analyst: You enjoy digging into data and finding patterns, trends, and insights that others might miss.
Knows their way around the data lifecycle: From collecting data to analyzing it and visualizing the results, you’re comfortable with the whole process.
Is comfortable with SQL: You know how to connect different data sources and make sure the data is clean and ready to be analyzed.
Sees automation as a plus: If you’ve got experience with Python or another tool for automating tasks, that’s great, but it’s not a deal-breaker.
Enjoys working with clients: You like collaborating with clients, listening to their needs, and helping them see how data can solve their problems.
Is a team player: You enjoy working with others, sharing knowledge, and learning together. You’re also comfortable guiding and training clients when needed.
Speaks Dutch or French, and English: You’re fluent in these languages, which helps you connect with our diverse clients.



At Solita, we care about creating a supportive, easy-going work environment where people can be themselves. We’re passionate about what we do and always looking for ways to improve. If you value collaboration, curiosity, and making an impact through data, we’d love to hear from you.

What We Offer

Possibility to learn and work with the latest technologies/tools
Nordic work culture of autonomy and professionalism
Individual benefit packages that suit your personal needs
Learning and career growth opportunities

We are looking for an innovative and data-focused leader to drive the program objectives, measurement strategy, and analytics efforts for primarily Cyclon, our overarching circularity program. You will play a critical part in defining the success metrics, improving data quality, reporting, and providing insights that influence strategic decisions around the program. This role will also expand its scope to further innovation and omnichannel-driven business ventures using a strong and agile ability to understand and implement insights from various sources, assess project feasibility, evaluate market opportunity and understand consumer perception. The ideal candidate will have a passion for sustainability and circular business models, coupled with expertise in data analysis and a strong growth-centric mindset.




Your mission

Collaborate with teams across e.g. Strategy, Innovation and Commercial to define clear Cyclon business objectives alongside the program execution and scaleup. Identify key improvement areas and act as the point of contact for measurement, data analytics, and research.
Lead efforts in defining and implementing customer journey tracking mechanisms that capture interactions and touchpoints across the entire Cyclon program lifecycle. Provide insights into customer feedback and engagement to optimize touchpoints and improve overall experience.
Work closely with the Cyclon core team to ensure the integrity of data collection and analysis around operational and customer experience (CX) metrics and derive insights that help drive the direction of the program. Assess the impact of our efforts and use internal and external insights (e.g. market data) to make suggestions on further growth opportunities.
Take ownership of assessing our existing Cyclon data landscape, then build and execute on blueprints for the future of our program reporting especially as it relates across sales channels. Develop and implement strategies to improve data quality, ensuring high-quality, actionable insights.
Define key KPIs and measures of success as well as establish the source of truth for performance reporting. Establish benchmarks and assess the commercial viability of both the existing program and new initiatives, and present data-driven insights to senior stakeholders to guide program evolution. Own standardized (e.g. monthly) reporting on the program and establish reporting frameworks for new programs.




Your story

You have 5+ years of experience as Data or Business Analyst in a Retail/Commercial/Consulting business, with experience in sustainable/circular programs a major plus.
You come with a clear understanding of the Commercial landscape including Ecommerce, merchandising, customer, product and brand KPIs.
You have experience translating strategy into action, building business cases and assessing feasibility of new business ventures using data and insights gathered from a variety of sources.
You are proficient in using query languages such as SQL, and have experience working with complex datasets. Experience with other analytical languages such as Python or R are considered a plus.
You are a strong communicator and cross-functional collaborator, with the ability to take workstream ownership, partner with different functions, and effectively move projects and topics forward.
You have experience with data visualization tools, such as Looker or Tableau, to provide insightful dashboards and visualizations.
You have a very strong analytical and quantitative mindset with a demonstrated ability to interpret and leverage data to drive decision making.

We are looking for an innovative and data-focused leader to drive the program objectives, measurement strategy, and analytics efforts for primarily Cyclon, our overarching circularity program. You will play a critical part in defining the success metrics, improving data quality, reporting, and providing insights that influence strategic decisions around the program. This role will also expand its scope to further innovation and omnichannel-driven business ventures using a strong and agile ability to understand and implement insights from various sources, assess project feasibility, evaluate market opportunity and understand consumer perception. The ideal candidate will have a passion for sustainability and circular business models, coupled with expertise in data analysis and a strong growth-centric mindset.




Your mission

Collaborate with teams across e.g. Strategy, Innovation and Commercial to define clear Cyclon business objectives alongside the program execution and scaleup. Identify key improvement areas and act as the point of contact for measurement, data analytics, and research.
Lead efforts in defining and implementing customer journey tracking mechanisms that capture interactions and touchpoints across the entire Cyclon program lifecycle. Provide insights into customer feedback and engagement to optimize touchpoints and improve overall experience.
Work closely with the Cyclon core team to ensure the integrity of data collection and analysis around operational and customer experience (CX) metrics and derive insights that help drive the direction of the program. Assess the impact of our efforts and use internal and external insights (e.g. market data) to make suggestions on further growth opportunities.
Take ownership of assessing our existing Cyclon data landscape, then build and execute on blueprints for the future of our program reporting especially as it relates across sales channels. Develop and implement strategies to improve data quality, ensuring high-quality, actionable insights.
Define key KPIs and measures of success as well as establish the source of truth for performance reporting. Establish benchmarks and assess the commercial viability of both the existing program and new initiatives, and present data-driven insights to senior stakeholders to guide program evolution. Own standardized (e.g. monthly) reporting on the program and establish reporting frameworks for new programs.




Your story

You have 5+ years of experience as Data or Business Analyst in a Retail/Commercial/Consulting business, with experience in sustainable/circular programs a major plus.
You come with a clear understanding of the Commercial landscape including Ecommerce, merchandising, customer, product and brand KPIs.
You have experience translating strategy into action, building business cases and assessing feasibility of new business ventures using data and insights gathered from a variety of sources.
You are proficient in using query languages such as SQL, and have experience working with complex datasets. Experience with other analytical languages such as Python or R are considered a plus.
You are a strong communicator and cross-functional collaborator, with the ability to take workstream ownership, partner with different functions, and effectively move projects and topics forward.
You have experience with data visualization tools, such as Looker or Tableau, to provide insightful dashboards and visualizations.
You have a very strong analytical and quantitative mindset with a demonstrated ability to interpret and leverage data to drive decision making.

ALLOS é uma marca com uma forte herança. São cerca de 50 anos de experiência, transformando o mercado no Brasil. Somos referência em excelência e inovação, com a qualidade e confiança que faz parte da nossa história.

A nova marca surgiu pronta para o futuro, a partir da fusão entre a Aliansce Sonae e a brMalls, em 2023. Mas, essa trajetória começou bem antes.

Tudo começou com a Aliansce, que inaugurou o primeiro shopping da região Nordeste e o segundo do Brasil em 1975. Em 2019, a fusão entre a Aliansce e a Sonae Sierra deu origem à Aliansce Sonae, tornando-se líder na administração de shoppings no Brasil, com 32 empreendimentos. Em 2006, surge a brMalls resultando em um portfólio de 30 ativos presentes nas cinco regiões do país.

E assim, em 2023, a ALLOS surge com o encontro de duas potências nacionais do segmento, unindo forças para se tornar a mais inovadora plataforma de entretenimento, lifestyle, serviços e compras.

Nossa história continua e estamos prontos para criar momentos que transformam e impactam a vida das pessoas, gerando conexões e oportunidades.
