Do you like a job with plenty of variety? Are you interested in data, programming, Risk, Finance and stakeholder management? Do you want to work in a dynamic and multidisciplinary team, and are you keen to share your knowledge? If so, take a look at the vacancy of Data Analyst (Internal Risk Reporting)!

We are constantly looking for ways to improve how we manage our risks and build reports on it.

Your job

On one hand your duties will consist of technical aspects such as SAS/SQL and Python programming, performing Data Quality analyses and integrating datasets. On the other hand you’ll be working on documentation and using your communicative skills for stakeholder alignment. You also play an active role in the frequent team meetings where knowledge-sharing and transparency on progress is key. You will be working in a team that largely consist of highly motivated colleagues with international backgrounds, working in an open and informal atmosphere. Given the importance the regulatory authorities ascribe on the data quality, this is a challenging and impactful role.

We employ 250+ international professionals with different backgrounds who are driven to bring risk data management to a structurally higher level. Our aim is to generate reliable risk data on time. We do this by improving the risk data itself, data systems and data processes. We work with an Agile operating model.

You are practical, have an analytical approach, good communication and presentation skills. You are a strong team player and you take responsibility for your work. In the dynamic environment in which you operate, you have the ability to get all stakeholders on board.

experience in SAS, SQL and/or Python
ability to analyse data sets
excellent verbal and written communications skills
interest in working with Finance and Risk data in a banking environment
knowledge of risk management in banking or financial institutions is a pre

In addition, we offer:


The ability to work flexible hours

Je gaat aan de slag met het omtoveren van data naar informatie. Hierbij maak je gebruik van analysetechnieken en je eigen kennis en kunde. Door jouw sociale vaardigheden begrijp je de context en de daaruit voortkomende vraag naar informatie van je collega. Je weet deze vraag door je technische vaardigheden te relateren aan de techniek om de gevraagde informatie beschikbaar te krijgen. Je zet hier databases voor op en ontwikkelt informatieproducten zoals dashboards inclusief het modelleren en visualiseren van de data.




Soms is de data nog niet beschikbaar. Je houdt je daarom ook bezig met het automatiseren van

bedrijfsprocessen en het meedenken over welke tooling en technieken van toegevoegde waarde

zijn om efficiënt en effectief van data informatie te maken. Niet enkel stel je informatie beschikbaar, je zorgt er ook voor dat deze informatie betrouwbaar is én ook van waarde is voor onze directe klant. Dit kan betekenen dat je gebruikers van informatie bijbrengt wat informatie-gestuurd werken is, hoe de gebruiker dit in zijn/haar context kan toepassen, door blijft vragen tot een duidelijke schets van het “probleem”, je analyses verricht die leiden tot inzichten, je adviseert over welke technische aspecten dienen te veranderen om mee te gaan in de ontwikkeling van analytics en meer!




Wat onze opdrachtgever van je verwacht

Bij onze opdrachtgever krijg je veel ruimte om jezelf te ontwikkelen. Wel is het fijn als je in ieder geval:

Beschikt over HBO werk- en denkniveau;

We zijn een zelfstandige afdeling, maar werken nauw samen met allerlei andere afdelingen en hebben onderling dan ook veel contact. Samen met de andere Data Analisten zoeken we naar oplossingen, helpen we elkaar bij query’s en dashboards en bedenken we gave dingen. Heb je zelf goede ideeën of initiatieven waardoor we nog slimmer naar de data kunnen kijken? Dan is er altijd ruimte om dat te onderzoeken. Dankzij de open, informele sfeer voel je je snel thuis bij ons.

Wat vragen wij?

Je hebt een afgeronde hbo- of wo-opleiding, het liefst in de richting van Business of IT.
Je hebt minimaal 2+ jaar werkervaring.
Je hebt ervaring met SQL en BI-tools (zoals Power BI).

Je spreekt en schrijft uitstekend Nederlands en Engels.




Wat bieden wij?

Een uitdagende functie in een sterk groeiend bedrijf.
De kans om je verder te ontwikkelen.
Uitstekend salaris en een aantrekkelijke pensioenregeling (wij betalen 75% van de premie).
Mogelijkheid tot reiskostenvergoeding.
25 vakantiedagen o.b.v. fulltime dienstverband.

Ben je maatschappelijk betrokken en wil je jongeren ondersteunen bij het maken van een studiekeuze? Begrijp je hoe belangrijk een studiekeuze is voor jongeren en dus óók het geven van de juiste informatie hierover? Weet je hoe je van data informatie kunt maken en heb je kennis van statistische methoden en technieken? Dan ben jij dé data-analist voor Landelijk Centrum Studiekeuze!




Ervaren data-analist/ methodoloog

(vaste baan, 32 uur per week, hybride/ Utrecht)




Wat ga je doen als data-analist?

Je bent onderdeel van de afdeling Informatiemanagement. Samen met je zeven collega’s werk je aan de productie van studiekeuze-informatie voor het hoger onderwijs (HO) en de ontsluiting ervan op Studiekeuze123.nl.




In deze rol help je bij de verwerking van diverse databronnen (zie Bronnen - Landelijk Centrum Studiekeuze (lcsk.nl) tot studiekeuze-informatie en doe je data-onderzoek. Zo werken een aantal van ons op dit moment aan de ontwikkeling van nieuwe informatie over beroepen en beroepsomschrijvingen, o.a. met behulp van AI en micro-data van het CBS.




Specifiek vragen we je in deze functie de bij Landelijk Centrum Studiekeuze beschikbare gegevens te analyseren en interessante beelden te halen uit de data in de Studiekeuzedatabase en uit de resultaten van de Nationale Studenten Enquête. We willen onderzoeken hoe en wat we kunnen koppelen met bijvoorbeeld open data van DUO of CBS om zo interessante nieuwsberichten op te stellen over studies en studiekeuze en t.b.v. nadere duiding van de NSE-resultaten. Wij beschikken over een unieke set data en kunnen op sommige maatschappelijke thema’s een interessante en aanvullende bijdrage leveren aan kennis.




Je gaat met de volgende activiteiten aan de slag:

·      Dataonderzoek: je zet methoden en technieken in voor het analyseren en visualiseren van HO data en hieruit afgeleide studiekeuze indicatoren. Hierbij maak je gebruik van statistische- en visualisatie- tools (zoals SPSS, Tableau en Python), maar we staan ook open voor nieuwe innovatieve technieken en ideeën om informatie te analyseren.

·      Van data naar informatie: met de resultaten uit je analyses maar ook op basis van specifieke onderzoeksvragen help je je collega’s van de afdeling communicatie interessante stukjes op te stellen t.b.v. nieuwsberichten en duiding van de NSE-resultaten

·      Datareleases: je werkt mee aan de reguliere databasereleases die negen keer per jaar plaatsvinden. Dan actualiseren we het onderwijsaanbod en verversen we verschillende bronnen in de Studiekeuzedatabase. We vragen vooral je inzet bij het generiek testen en reviewen en bij de verwerking van onze databronnen voor de arbeidsmarktindicatoren.

·      Functioneel beheer van het Hoger Onderwijs Voorlichtings Informatiesysteem (HOVI): ondersteunen van de HOVI-productmanager bij de vernieuwing en doorontwikkeling van HOVI. Je denkt mee over mogelijke verbeteringen van het instrumentarium als gevolg van wensen van de gebruikers of door ontwikkelingen in het HO-informatielandschap.

·      Toekomstverkenning: we nodigen je uit mee te denken met onze voorbereiding op de toekomst. Ter borging van de kwaliteit willen we bijvoorbeeld onderzoeken welke alternatieve software (naast SPSS) het beste gebruikt kan worden voor onze dataverwerking.




Landelijk Centrum Studiekeuze is een klein team en werkt onderling nauw samen. Dit betekent dat je ook bijspringt bij andere werkzaamheden als dit nodig is.




Wie ben jij?

Je bent een academisch opgeleide data-analist met meerdere jaren werkervaring in een functie met vergelijkbare taken. Je hebt aantoonbaar methodologische kennis en praktische werkervaring met bronnen- en literatuuronderzoek en data-analyses. Je hebt veel ervaring met de toepassing van statistische software zoals SPSS, maar ook de ontwikkelingen rond AI hebben meer dan gemiddeld je interesse. Je bent in staat kwantitatieve beelden om te zetten in informatieve teksten waarbij je cijfers verbindt met actuele maatschappelijke vraagstukken en interessegebieden. Dit betekent dat je nieuwsgierig bent, innovatief en ondernemend, vloeiend Nederlands spreekt en schrijft, oog hebt voor je omgeving en beschikt over goede communicatieve vaardigheden.




Het verwerken van data tot informatie in de Studiekeuzedatabase vraagt een grote mate van accuraatheid, testen en reviewen. Landelijk Centrum Studiekeuze werkt met een ISO9001 kwaliteitsmanagementsysteem, we verwachten dat je het belang hiervan begrijpt en naleeft. Ervaring bij onderwijs(-gerelateerde) organisaties is een pré.




Jouw werkplek

Landelijk Centrum Studiekeuze is gehuisvest in Utrecht en bestaat momenteel uit 20 gedreven medewerkers die studiekiezers ondersteunen in hun studiekeuzeproces op basis van de meest actuele, accurate en objectieve onderwijsdata. De afdeling Informatiemanagement bestaat uit het Hoofd Informatiemanagement, 3 productmanagers (voor de Nationale Studenten Enquête, de Studiekeuzedatabase, en voor HOVI). Daarnaast hebben we een programmamanager voor de NSE, een projectleider voor het project Arbeidsmarktinformatie en 2 databeheerders/methodologen.




Waar kom je te werken?

Landelijk Centrum Studiekeuze richt zich met de studiekeuzevoorlichting primair op havo- en vwo-scholieren die willen studeren in het hoger onderwijs, maar ook op de mensen die het keuzeproces ondersteunen zoals ouders van studiekiezers en decanen in het voortgezet onderwijs. Daarnaast biedt Landelijk Centrum Studiekeuze informatie over studeren in het hoger onderwijs voor mbo-doorstromers, masterkiezers en volwassenen die al werken en daarnaast willen studeren.




De onafhankelijke website Studiekeuze123.nl (circa 2 miljoen unieke bezoekers per jaar) biedt studiekiezers de mogelijkheid opleidingen in het hoger onderwijs met elkaar te vergelijken. Landelijk Centrum Studiekeuze beheert hiervoor een omvangrijke Studiekeuzedatabase met objectieve studiekeuze-informatie. Deze informatie wordt ook kosteloos gedeeld met andere (studiekeuze)organisaties. Landelijk Centrum Studiekeuze wordt volledig gefinancierd door het Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschap.




Wat biedt Landelijk Centrum Studiekeuze jou?

Wij bieden je een afwisselende baan met veel ruimte voor eigen initiatief, in een prettige omgeving met een goede sfeer, betrokken collega's en veel aandacht voor mentale en fysieke arbeidsomstandigheden.




Naast een arbeidsovereenkomst voor 1 jaar en met de intentie tot verlenging naar een vast dienstverband, kun je rekenen op:

·      Een salaris conform de salarisschalen van de Nederlandse Universiteiten. De functie wordt afhankelijk van je kennis en ervaring ingeschaald in salarisschaal 11 (€4.332,- tot maximaal €5.929,- bruto per maand o.b.v. 40 uur per week);

·      20 wettelijke vakantiedagen (o.b.v. fulltime dienstverband);

·      4 tot 7 bovenwettelijke vakantiedagen (o.b.v. fulltime dienstverband);

·      12 ADV dagen (o.b.v. fulltime dienstverband);

·      Een eindejaarsuitkering in de vorm van een 13e maand;

·      Zakelijke laptop en telefoon;

·      Een NS-Business Card voor je woon-werkverkeer;

·      Scholingsmogelijkheden;

·      De mogelijkheid gedeeltelijk thuis te werken (maximaal 50%);

·      Wekelijks een (niet-verplicht) gezamenlijk sportmoment.

Bol is transforming retail to make the daily lives of 13 million Dutch and Belgian customers easier. On this mission, we are accompanied by 48,000 partners who delight customers with unique propositions. In total, our retail tech platform now offers about 38 million products. It’s an incredibly rich engine. But it’s also an engine that runs smoothly only when financial processes are smooth. It’s up to you to make a significant and customer-relevant contribution to that.

The biggest challenge

If data is the new gold, bol.com is sitting on a colossal goldmine. We are fervently mining it, continuously creating new tunnels within it. The underground infrastructure is in place, the mine carts are rolling. Now it’s up to you to extract, sort, and shape the data gold into its finest form. With the resulting 24K insights, we enhance the processes within both Finance and Invoicing, aligning them perfectly with the needs of our customers and partners. It’s an analytically challenging role because we have 13 million customers choosing from 38 million products offered by over 48,000 providers. Can you take the these domains to the next level?

What You'll Do As a Financial Data Analyst

How do we ensure that actuals are truly 100% up-to-date given the inherent complexity of a large and fast-growing retail tech platform? And how do we help the business interpret the financial impact of (sometimes) disruptive propositions? As a Financial Data Analyst within the Fintech/Finance Data team , you work together with your stakeholders to design dashboards and reconciliations that support the data driven business decisions that will help bol moving forward. In this role you really are involved from A to Z; you design, build, update, monitor and evaluate your projects together with your team and stakeholders. You will also be an ambassador for data-driven thinking and decision making. In other words, you inspire colleagues with insightful data-driven perspectives and demonstrate and promote the value of data savviness.

As a tech-driven organization, we are fully committed to automated processes. In other words, manual work is “prohibited,” underscoring and magnifying the importance of data-driven work. As a data analyst within the Fintech/Finance Data team, automation and self-service is always one of the cornerstones of the projects you deliver.


You develop and maintain financial connections, reconciliations, and dashboards that prove the reliability of financial reporting.
You provide reports that enable drilldowns into transaction flows.
You create insights that will help financial teams to steer our commercial organization.
You support the teams in addressing complex data challenges.
You conceptualize and promote a data-driven way of working.
You advise stakeholders on finance-related (data) issues.
You support and advice product teams with on the fly analyses on the financial impact of process challenges.


Why you can make a difference

You approach processes with a data mindset and enjoy seeking opportunities for improvement. You are committed to working with team members, colleagues from the broader finance community, and the business itself to make progress. You enthusiastically take on data initiatives and have the stakeholder management skills to see projects through to completion without losing people along the way. To have maximum impact, you need to be a passionate data explorer, not someone who keeps their insights to themselves. You may go fast alone, but together with your team and stakeholders, you will go further.

3 reasons why this is (not) for you Switch to find out


You confuse the trees for the forest Not if you often get lost in the data trees and miss the bigger picture.
You never make mistakes You are critical of everything and everyone, except your own findings.
Your tent is pitched by a gentle stream You thrive best in calm, unchanging work environments #stillwatersdontrust.
You have the right experience You hold a relevant Master's degree, coupled with 2-3 years of data analytical experience, and you are an inspiring query guru with deep SQL and dashboarding and data storytelling skills.
You love data Well, if you dream about data, breathe it, and frequently declare your love for it.
You are a team builder You are a team player who loves to build, both yourself and your team.


This where you will work

At the leading online retail tech platform of the Netherlands and Belgium. A platform where 13 million Dutch and Belgian customers choose from over 38 million items. And a platform that helps about 48,000 business partners succeed. But above all, a platform that is never ‘finished’, because bol has been changing retail since 1999. And we will continue to do so. If it can be improved, we make it better! Together with customers, partners, and around 2,900 colleagues. And hopefully, together with you. Because together, we are changing retail to make daily life easier.

It is our responsibility to enable an environment that unleashes the power of diversity.

Wie zijn wij?

Werkleerbedrijf Lucrato is dé arbeidsbemiddelaar voor mensen die door psychische, mentale en/of lichamelijke belemmeringen extra ondersteuning nodig hebben bij het vinden van betaald en duurzaam werk en voor werkgevers die graag sociaal willen ondernemen. Onze naam staat voor winst. Omdat we geloven dat werken op meerdere manieren winst oplevert. Sociale, maatschappelijke en economische winst. Winst voor werkzoekenden én voor werkgevers.

Identificeren van trends en patronen in datasets om strategische kansen en risico’s bloot te leggen.
Vertalen van met name niet-financiële data naar heldere inzichten en aanbevelingen voor het management.
Ondersteunen bij ad-hoc analyses.
Rapporteren aan relevante instanties (denk aan CBS, Divosa, Panteia, SBCM en gemeentes).
Samenwerken met andere afdelingen om databehoeften te begrijpen en te ondersteunen.
Zorgdragen voor de kwaliteit en nauwkeurigheid van de verzamelde gegevens en het meewerken aan procesverbeteringen.
Het begeleiden en trainen van gebruikers in PowerBI.

Leergierig.
Ervaring met BI-tools (bij voorkeur PowerBI).
Kennis van ETL-processen en data-integratie.

Maakt makkelijk contact met andere afdelingen en bent daarin proactief en oplossingsgericht.
In staat om zowel zelfstandig als in teamverband te werken.

Voor de verschillende werkmaatschappijen van Louwman analyseren ze de aanwezige data, en zorgen dat deze goed gemodelleerd beschikbaar komt in ons Data Platform ZUNO. Ben jij sterk in het doorgronden van complexe datastructuren, word je blij van een goed datamodel en bijbehorende documentatie, dan zoeken we jou!


Wat ga je doen?
Als Data Specialist ben je onderdeel van het Data Office binnen het Customer Experience Center van de Louwman Groep. Het Data Office waakt over de data binnen de organisatie en zorgt dat deze goed wordt beheerd en beschikbaar gemaakt voor de business. Je werkt met zes andere collega's aan datamodellen die op ons cloud Data Platform ZUNO worden geïmplementeerd. Hiervoor heb je veel contact met de werkmaatschappijen van de Louwman Groep en verdiep je jezelf in hun doelstellingen, processen en (stuur)informatiebehoefte. Op basis hiervan ga je op zoek naar data in de gebruikte IT-systemen of externe bronnen en vertaalt dat naar een begrijpelijk gegevensmodel dat de gegevens daadwerkelijk ontsluit voor analyse, rapportage en dashboarding. Je stemt alles zorgvuldig af met alle betrokkenen en zorgt voor duidelijke specificaties voor de Data Engineers en helpt nadien de BI Specialisten en Data Scientists in het gebruik van de gegevens. Als 'collectief geheugen' rondom de Louwman data sta je ook altijd klaar om vragen te beantwoorden en mensen op weg te helpen in hun 'data journey'.

Wie ben jij?
Je bent als eerste iemand die makkelijk contact maakt met allerlei soorten collega’s, zowel uit de business als uit de techniek. Je vindt het leuk om uit te zoeken hoe de 'data puzzel' in elkaar zit en hoe je dit begrijpbaar kan maken. Je vindt zelfstandig je weg van een informatievraag tot een werkend antwoord. Je werkproduct is een datamodel met bijbehorende documentatie, zorgt dat deze geïmplementeerd wordt en zorgt dat het daarna gebruikt wordt en waarde levert voor de organisatie. Je ziet verbanden tussen data uit verschillende hoeken van het bedrijf en zorgt dat data wordt geïntegreerd zodat de Louwman Groep ook steeds meer als groep kan opereren.

We vragen hiervoor:


Een HBO of universitair werk- en denkniveau;
Minimaal drie jaar ervaring in een soortgelijke functie (informatie analist);
Ervaring met data warehouses en/of business intelligence trajecten;
Kennis van de kunst van het data modelleren;
Vloeiend Nederlands in woord en geschrift.



Wat kun je van ons verwachten?

Een salaris tussen de € 4.000 en €5.600 bruto per maand op basis 40 uur per week, afgestemd op jouw kennis en ervaring;
De mogelijkheid om hybride te werken en flexibiliteit in je werktijden;
Een leuke functie met veel vrijheid je werk in te delen. In een enthousiast en professioneel team (5 directe collega’s) waarbij je de mogelijkheid hebt om afwisselend werk te doen voor de verschillende bedrijven binnen de Louwman Group;
Gunstige personeelsaankoopregeling voor onze producten (auto’s, motorfietsen, fietsen, watersportproducten), accessoires en onderhoud.



Wil jij als Data Specialist meebouwen aan de toekomst van Louwman Group? Kom ook verder en solliciteer direct!

Wie zijn wij?
Bij Louwman Group, een 100% familiebedrijf, is onze missie: Passie om mensen te bewegen.

Extensive experience as a Data Engineer, with a proven track record of extracting key insights from large and distributed data-sets.
You’re passionate about data at every level, from raw to transformed, and excited to deep-dive and research uncharted data waters, like data lakes and their ramifications.
You are passionate about improving way-of-working and increasing team maturity.
If you have previous experience within Client and its data landscape, it is a plus but not mandatory.
A day in your life with us: You will explore adding new data points into our data lake, starting from discovery, exploration, implementation and validation.
You will be using a variety of modern technologies, from GCP Big Query to Dataform to REST API’s to Azure Blob Storage.
You will be challenged constantly to improve data collection, transformation and delivery.
You will take ownership and lead the discovery of data, the technical direction of the implementation and the technical conversations with data consumers.
You will code in Python and SQL, and you will adhere to client best practices while doing so.
You will join the Marketing Performance Data Automation team, an established team and a mature product that needs to grow fast.
We’re currently at 18 data points and we have the ambition of getting to 39 in the next 12 months. We also need to maintain the existing data landscape by keeping it clean, up-to-date and proactively validated.




Requirements:




Proficiency in data-pipeline work, GCP, Big Query, Cloud Run, SQL and Python are the base of your success.
Data form knowledge is a plus, but not mandatory. However, your can-do attitude and problem-solving skills are equally important.
Navigating the complexities of the general data landscape, while also understanding the most intimate details of a specific data set required both technical and soft skills.
Together as a team : You will join a team of 3 Data Engineers, and collaboration is what makes us stand out from the crowd and ensures continuous and high-quality deliverables.
We’re focused on the customer value we provide, so asking “why are we doing this?” is always not only accepted, but also expected and encouraged.
You are expected to collaborate closely with the existing team, adhere to best practices but also suggest improvements in the ways of working. “How can we do this better.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

We are looking for a Data Analyst that is passionate about metrics and telling the stories behind the data. We have several roles open across different teams (grocery, loyalty, restaurants). Data Analysts at Deliveroo report into our data science management team.

You will be a professional in insights storytelling, communication and visualisation and know how to create action from metrics. Crafting effective intelligent benchmarks, understanding performance, caring about data quality, enabling automation and creating phenomenal visualisations and stories are things that drive you.

What you'll be doing



Work closely with commercial stakeholders to create value and business impact through better data availability, visualisation and analysis
Discover, analyse, and interpret trends or patterns in complex datasets to perform ad-hoc analyses and deliver insights to the executive team and senior management
Understand key drivers of the business and provide data driven guidance on key levers
Identify and specify data needs and quality requirements and work closely with Analytics Engineers to ensure data is available, accurate and corresponds to the business needs
Consolidate and distribute best analytical practices from different teams and countries



Requirements



Experience identifying the root cause of problems, assessing risks/impacts and determining and implementing effective solutions.
A good understanding of querying in SQL and understanding of database structure - you'll be expected to be able to extract the data you need for your analysis.
Compelling story-telling skills, and an eye for powerful visualisations - you'll need to translate your findings for all levels of stakeholder (business and technical)
Good knowledge of Excel/GSheets - depending on the task, there is a good chance that this is where some of your exploratory analysis will take place. Being comfortable with pivot tables and functions will be essential.
Developer experience with a data visualisation tool (Looker, Tableau, Periscope)

Scalexperts have partnered with a London based business who, as part of the beginning of a large scale data transformation, are looking to hire a Data Analyst on a permanent basis. Various departments within the business are keen to do more with their data, with the initial focus of the role involving the development and implementation of various dashboards within PowerBI. The role will also involve some data analysis with SQL, and requirements gathering from cross-functional teams - Marketing, Operations, Technology etc. The end goal of this initial phase is for a self-serve reporting capability to be built. The longer term vision for this role is to provide strategic analysis that aids in decision making whilst also ensuring a high level of data quality and governance across the company.




Although this role involves both analysis and technical work, the emphasis is on the analysis and reporting side with roughly 20% of the role involving SQL coding.




Key Responsibilities:

Working closely with the Head of Data to drive the implementation of the data strategy
Pushing the adoption of PowerBI, taking existing reports/tools and migrating them onto PowerBI using trusted data
Analyse the existing SQL database and ensure that it is fit for purpose, making alterations and recommendations where appropriate
Build frameworks with teams company wide to ensure that requirements for data and reporting are documented
Build strong relationships across the company to ensure the data strategy continues to align with the business strategy and aid in insights driven decision making
Ensure that the data the wider business has access to is of high quality and can be trusted




Key Skills Required:

3-6 years in a data/reporting/insights role, delivering analysis on how a business gathers, reports and stores its data
Previous experience of working with data from external-facing teams ie. sales/marketing
Experience with PowerBI and creating dashboards from scratch
Knowledge of SQL coding - ability to use stored procedures etc
Able to translate technical/data concepts to non-technical stakeholders
Experience presenting findings to stakeholders at all level - this transformation is being closely followed by multiple senior figures within the organisation
Comfortable in taking ownership - the data team is in it's infancy so there will be an onus on being able to adapt, working within a certain amount of ambiguity and providing value to the business despite a low level of data maturity
Experience within a SaaS/B2B company would be highly advantageous




This company are based in central London and operate a hybrid working model with 3 days/week in the office.
