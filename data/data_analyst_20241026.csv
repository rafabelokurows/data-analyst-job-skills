Location: Seattle, WA

 

Company Overview:

At Gradial, we’re removing the barriers between human creativity and execution. Our mission is to empower marketers and creatives to implement their ideas directly, with fundamentally mutable software that adapts to execute users’ intentions. Our primary focus is arbitrary updates to websites, including full scale migration to new design systems and automatic improvements.




We’re a team of engineers and sellers who believe in extreme ownership, scrappy problem solving, and critical path planning. Backed by world-class investors and grounded in first principles thinking, we tackle problems from the ground up—always questioning assumptions and seeking the most elegant solutions. If you want to take risks, work on groundbreaking technology, and see the direct impact of your work, Gradial is where you belong.

 

What we’re building:

Model Orchestration: We’re mastering the art of foundation model-driven multi-step planning, reasoning, and execution to fulfill user requests precisely. Innovations include continuous inference with dynamic prompt manipulation / tool use.
Learning Systems: We’re designing systems that improve themselves through feedback, end-user analytics, domain-specific knowledge, and customer brand preferences.
End-User Programmable Software: This is uncharted territory. We’re creating software that users can reshape on-the-fly—imagine being able to add or remove features or change the UX/UI in real time.

 

Position Overview:

We’re looking for engineers who thrive in the unknown, see constraints as challenges to be overcome, and are ready to build what’s never been built before.

Key Responsibilities:

Create software that seamlessly integrates with generative AI, transforming user commands into intelligent, actionable workflows.
Push the boundaries of what’s possible by developing new methods for model orchestration—having models operate in the real world.
Ensure our systems operate at peak performance and scalability through robust code, rigorous testing, and continuous optimization.
Engage in cross-functional discussions, code reviews, and problem-solving sessions to maintain high standards of code quality and innovation.
Stay ahead of technological advancements and infuse our products with cutting-edge solutions.
Own Your Work: At Gradial, there are no PMs—you will be responsible for both the product and engineering aspects of your work.

 

Requirements:

Critical thinker who can break down complex problems and deliver innovative solutions.
Excellent communication skills and a team player who thrives in a dynamic, cross-functional environment, capable of operating without strict discipline boundaries.
Whether you’ve had opportunities to solve hard problems in the past or have a burning desire to do so in the future, you’re ready to take on the challenge.

 

Desired:

A strong foundation in math and physics. Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, or a related field.
Expertise in languages such as TypeScript, Rust, or similar. A solid grasp of software engineering principles, data structures, and algorithms. Familiarity with web development frameworks (e.g., React) and AI/ML technologies.
Adaptable and ready to tackle unforeseen challenges.
Experience in a startup environment.

 

Benefits:

Competitive salary and equity options that reflect your skills and contributions.
Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance.
Flexible work arrangements and a commitment to work-life balance.
Opportunities for career growth, professional development, and to influence the direction of a groundbreaking company.
A no-nonsense work environment where you can take extreme ownership of your work and see the direct impact of your contributions.

 

How to Apply:

If you’re ready to join a team of hardcore engineers and shape the future of generative AI-powered software, apply now! Send your resume to careers@gradial.com and tell us about the hardest problem you’ve solved.

 

Gradial Culture and Mission: At Gradial, we are committed to ensuring our customers wield their creativity like magic.

Job Description:

seeking a Data Engineer to join the team that is building data infrastructure to support analytical and operational finance requirements.

The team is committed to building the next-generation data platform that will enable support for rapidly growing and dynamic businesses, and use it to deliver the analytical and operational applications which will have an immediate influence on day-to-day decision-making.

Our platform serves finance, supply chain, and accounting functions across the globe.

You will be primarily using but not limited to AWS solution stacks like Redshift, S3, Lambda, SNS/SQS, Lake-formation, Simple EDI (SEDI), SFTP, Data Pipelines (AWS Glue/Hammerstone), and reporting tools such as Tableau and Alteryx to implement solutions.

As a Data Engineer, you should be an expert with data warehousing technical components (e.g. Data Modeling, ETL, and Reporting), infrastructure (e.g. hardware and software), and their integration.

You should have a deep understanding of the architecture for enterprise-level data warehouse solutions using multiple platforms (RDBMS, Columnar, Cloud).

You should be an expert in the design, creation, management, and business use of large datasets.

The candidate is expected to be able to build efficient, flexible, extensible, and scalable ETL and reporting solutions.

• Own the design, development, and maintenance of ongoing metrics, reports, analyses, dashboards, etc. to drive key business decisions.

• Tune application and query performance using profiling tools and SQL.

• Analyze and solve problems at their root, stepping back to understand the broader context.

• Continually improve ongoing reporting and analysis processes, automating or simplifying self-service support for datasets.

• Recognize and adopt best practices in reporting and analysis: data integrity, test design, analysis, validation, and documentation.

• Developing and supporting the analytic technologies that give our customers timely, flexible and structured access to their data.
