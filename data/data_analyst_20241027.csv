About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of 190 people and 37 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

Vinted Marketplace is the largest online international C2C marketplace in Europe dedicated to second-hand fashion, with millions of registered members spanning 22 markets in Europe and North America. With a mission to make second-hand the first choice worldwide, Vinted enables people to sell and buy second-hand clothes and lifestyle items from each other, helping give those items a second or even third life.

Vinted Go launched in 2022, with a focus on developing products and solutions for more seamless shipping and delivery across Europe. Vinted Go has connected more than 40 carriers and more than 200,000 PUDO points across Europe to support the delivery of millions of parcels per year.

The Vinted Group, composed of Vinted Marketplace and Vinted Go, is headquartered in Vilnius, with workplaces in Germany, Lithuania, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and over 2,000 employees. It is backed by six leading venture capital firms: Accel, Burda Principal Investments, EQT Growth, Insight Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Sprints Capital.

Information about the position

At Vinted, Shipping Pricing is a key channel to grow our platform by making high-stake investment decisions. We have a Decision Scientist opening in the Shipping Pricing area. As a Decision Scientist, you’ll join our Marketing Data Science & Analytics (Marketing DSA) team where a mix of talented people with backgrounds from academia, econometrics, e-commerce, consulting, and media apply a scientific approach to solve worldwide business problems. You will report to the Manager of Data Science & Analytics and work in the team of experienced Decision and Data Scientists.

In the Shipping Pricing domain, in addition to being a member of Marketing DSA, you’ll also become a member of the Shipping Pricing team – a key team driving Vinted Marketplace growth through shipping discount strategies. Your primary responsibility will be to enable the team to optimise our investments via experimentation (AB testing), in-depth data analysis, and creation of new ROI models. In this role, you will collaborate with analytics engineers, decision scientists, and pricing analysts to identify and fulfil data requirements in this area.

Within Data Science & Analytics (DSA) we have three distinct roles. We believe that each role can make a similarly sized business impact in different ways and therefore our salary ranges are the same for all three roles. To understand your role within DSA context better, here are brief descriptions of each role we have in the department:


Decision Scientists are responsible for actionable insights, identifying and sizing opportunities, and automated tools that increase the quality of product and business decisions by applying statistical methods and data-driven decision-making.
Data Scientists are responsible for identification of algorithmic opportunities, ensuring those opportunities are addressed in an optimal fashion and design, development and maintenance of production-grade statistical and machine learning algorithms.
Analytics Engineers are responsible for data curation – translating data needs from stakeholders into architecting, building and maintaining efficient & reliable data models and pipelines.


In this position, you’ll


Create High Impact: Contribute to the development of new ROI/ROAS and payback models to measure Shipping Discount campaigns’ performance
Always remain challenged: Investigate revenue streams that Shipping Pricing generates – think of acquisition, reactivation and engagement on both sides of a two-sided market, i.e. seller and buyer
Be involved: Analyse how shipping discount investments drive user acquisition and retention, engagement, and lifetime value
Raise Our Data Quality Standards: Drive the usage of data & analytics within the organisation by making the Shipping Pricing data obvious for everyone to understand, interpret, and use in daily decision-making
Co-create across Marketplace & DSA: Pitch your findings to your team as well as marketing or shipping pricing colleagues to pivot the models used to measure success


About You


Strong statistical, analytical, strategic, and business skills
Highly business-results-oriented and able to connect science with pragmatic problem-solving
A good communicator who can present results in an informative and persuasive manner to a wide range of stakeholders
Intermediate-to-extensive working experience as a Decision Scientist, Data Analyst, or Data Scientist
Experienced with AB testing and measuring causal relationships using advanced statistical methods
Strong knowledge of at least one statistical programming language (R, Python, Stata, Matlab etc.)
Fluency with SQL and experience with dashboarding tools (e.g. Looker, Tableau, etc.)
A graduate degree in statistics, econometrics, economics, business or a similar field
Excellent at communicating in written and spoken English
Advantage: Previous experience with Marketing Analytics, in particular, ROI/ROAS models

Vinted Marketplace is the largest online international C2C marketplace in Europe dedicated to second-hand fashion, with millions of registered members spanning 22 markets in Europe and North America. With a mission to make second-hand the first choice worldwide, Vinted enables people to sell and buy second-hand clothes and lifestyle items from each other, helping give those items a second or even third life.

Vinted Go launched in 2022, with a focus on developing products and solutions for more seamless shipping and delivery across Europe. Vinted Go has connected more than 40 carriers and more than 200,000 PUDO points across Europe to support the delivery of millions of parcels per year.

The Vinted Group, composed of Vinted Marketplace and Vinted Go, is headquartered in Vilnius, with workplaces in Germany, Lithuania, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and over 2,000 employees. It is backed by six leading venture capital firms: Accel, Burda Principal Investments, EQT Growth, Insight Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Sprints Capital.

Information about the position

At Vinted, Shipping Pricing is a key channel to grow our platform by making high-stake investment decisions. We have a Decision Scientist opening in the Shipping Pricing area. As a Decision Scientist, you’ll join our Marketing Data Science & Analytics (Marketing DSA) team where a mix of talented people with backgrounds from academia, econometrics, e-commerce, consulting, and media apply a scientific approach to solve worldwide business problems. You will report to the Manager of Data Science & Analytics and work in the team of experienced Decision and Data Scientists.

In the Shipping Pricing domain, in addition to being a member of Marketing DSA, you’ll also become a member of the Shipping Pricing team – a key team driving Vinted Marketplace growth through shipping discount strategies. Your primary responsibility will be to enable the team to optimise our investments via experimentation (AB testing), in-depth data analysis, and creation of new ROI models. In this role, you will collaborate with analytics engineers, decision scientists, and pricing analysts to identify and fulfil data requirements in this area.

Within Data Science & Analytics (DSA) we have three distinct roles. We believe that each role can make a similarly sized business impact in different ways and therefore our salary ranges are the same for all three roles. To understand your role within DSA context better, here are brief descriptions of each role we have in the department:


Decision Scientists are responsible for actionable insights, identifying and sizing opportunities, and automated tools that increase the quality of product and business decisions by applying statistical methods and data-driven decision-making.
Data Scientists are responsible for identification of algorithmic opportunities, ensuring those opportunities are addressed in an optimal fashion and design, development and maintenance of production-grade statistical and machine learning algorithms.
Analytics Engineers are responsible for data curation – translating data needs from stakeholders into architecting, building and maintaining efficient & reliable data models and pipelines.


In this position, you’ll


Create High Impact: Contribute to the development of new ROI/ROAS and payback models to measure Shipping Discount campaigns’ performance
Always remain challenged: Investigate revenue streams that Shipping Pricing generates – think of acquisition, reactivation and engagement on both sides of a two-sided market, i.e. seller and buyer
Be involved: Analyse how shipping discount investments drive user acquisition and retention, engagement, and lifetime value
Raise Our Data Quality Standards: Drive the usage of data & analytics within the organisation by making the Shipping Pricing data obvious for everyone to understand, interpret, and use in daily decision-making
Co-create across Marketplace & DSA: Pitch your findings to your team as well as marketing or shipping pricing colleagues to pivot the models used to measure success


About You


Strong statistical, analytical, strategic, and business skills
Highly business-results-oriented and able to connect science with pragmatic problem-solving
A good communicator who can present results in an informative and persuasive manner to a wide range of stakeholders
Intermediate-to-extensive working experience as a Decision Scientist, Data Analyst, or Data Scientist
Experienced with AB testing and measuring causal relationships using advanced statistical methods
Strong knowledge of at least one statistical programming language (R, Python, Stata, Matlab etc.)
Fluency with SQL and experience with dashboarding tools (e.g. Looker, Tableau, etc.)
A graduate degree in statistics, econometrics, economics, business or a similar field
Excellent at communicating in written and spoken English
Advantage: Previous experience with Marketing Analytics, in particular, ROI/ROAS models
Advantage: Strong econometrics knowledge (statistical models, regression analyses)
Advantage: Advanced knowledge of R/Python

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

About The Consumer Data Science Team

Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists (Analytics) and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering team who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience that requires a good mix of technical and stakeholder engagement skills. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics or data science role. Data Scientists at Wolt take ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we're looking for someone like you.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland and Sweden. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
5+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent for product development (preferably consumer-facing).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Let's kick things off with a quick intro. Jane is a team that's all about fostering growth, spreading delight, and serving our healthcare community. We're on the hunt for people ready to jump in and join us while we simplify the lives of healthcare practitioners and patients daily. And guess what? Jane is a remote-first company, meaning every role at Jane, including this one, is remote — giving you the freedom to work from any corner of Canada.

Your Role in Our Journey

Jane is looking for a Senior Data Analyst who will be responsible for delivering consistent, meaningful insights across Jane departments. You will lead analytical projects and partner closely with cross-functional pods of product managers, marketers, engineers, and data analysts. You will have strong experience with SQL, dbt, Looker, Snowflake and preferably experience in a fast growing software company. They are excited about the opportunity to be responsible for analytics across multiple subject areas and looking forward to the prospect of mentoring junior analysts. They are passionate about transparency, accuracy, creating delightful experiences with data, and digging deep in to the ""why."" We want every team at Jane to have the ability to make decisions inspired by data and you will have the opportunity to help make this happen from the ground up.

Learn More About Us

We're founder-led, which means we live our values while maintaining a clear vision for the future. Our product enables the likes of physiotherapists, mental health counsellors, chiropractors, and other allied health practitioners to run their practices in a digital-first way through features such as online booking, charting, scheduling, telehealth, secure payments and billing along with an evolving library of features. You can see more of them here .

There is often a high bar set, not just for the quality of work, but for the care we show for each other and our customers. And it’s our customers raising that bar, never standing still and continually improving which keeps us on our toes. It's not just about what you've done before or how quickly you work; it's about your curiosity and drive to solve the right problems and your agility in learning new ways of thinking.

No doubt, Jane's a special place to work. There is autonomy and flexibility to help integrate work into your life in a way that makes sense for you. Need to block out time to pick up the kids? Go for it. That's normal here. And yes, we have a Slack channel for parents, but we've also got channels dedicated to plants, furry friends, food, pride, wellness - you get the idea! While we love to connect virtually, the Jane team also connects in person throughout the year. That comes in the form of departmental get-togethers, company retreats, or possibly a conference or two across North America if you’re keen to learn more about our community of healthcare providers. We're on the search for folks who are ready to dive in and become part of our journey toward making healthcare professionals' lives easier every single day.

You can also learn more about Jane as a company and a product by checking out our Glassdoor reviews and our Capterra Reviews

But we’ll also keep it real — as much as we love our work, the mountain we're climbing is always getting taller. We're a growing company, and with that comes the challenge of navigating an environment with many moving parts, often without a clear-cut path laid out in front of us. This is where you come in. If you're the kind of person who gets a kick out of being resourceful and loves solving problems, you'll fit right in.

Our vision as we move towards 2025 is all about creating More Happier Helpers. That means not just growing in numbers, but growing a community of thriving healthcare professionals who provide top-notch care with Jane at the heart of their operations. If you're someone who's feeling stifled by bureaucracy, itching to shake things up, or just someone who wants to make a genuine impact in the world, consider if the Jane team is the place for you.

We believe in collaboration, humility, and keeping a growth mindset. We're looking for people who can embrace our way of working, which often means being flexible and open to change. So, if after reading this, you feel excited about the opportunity — all in the name of helping those who help others — reach out to us to learn more.

In short, if you're excited by our growth, ready to contribute to a challenging yet rewarding environment, and eager to be a disruptor alongside a team of talented individuals, we’d love to hear from you!

Compensation Expectations For The Role

Jane’s committed to paying our team members fairly, clearly, and above all, paying for growth. This role has a minimum annual salary of $97,600 and maximum annual salary of $152,400. As you may have noticed, this salary range is quite large, and this is intentional to account for the growth someone will experience in the role throughout their time at Jane (i.e., from building the skills, to accomplished, to highly proficient, all the way to achieving excellence in the role). When hiring talented folks to join the Jane team, we’ve found that new team members are best set up for success when hired with the expectation of being fully accomplished in the role, which for this role would reflect a starting salary of $115,900.

It's also possible to join Jane at a salary above or below this, which would mean a salary below $115,900 typically reflects someone who has all the potential to be fully accomplished in the role but doesn't yet possess all the skills required, while a salary above $115,900 is typically for individuals who are currently in this role at Jane and had the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on our customers, product and company with deep Jane knowledge. At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.

Paying clearly is one of our compensation fundamentals to help folks build trust in the compensation process at Jane. To better understand Jane’s compensation fundamentals and how this range is determined, click on this link here for a short video walkthrough of how it all works! We also welcome you to ask as many questions as you’d like about compensation throughout the interview process to ensure you feel confident and build trust through the process.

More information on our benefits can be found here !

At Jane, we’re committed to fostering an environment that allows you to come to work as your truest self. We believe it’s important to actively recognize, embrace, and celebrate our differences in order to make Jane an inclusive, equitable, and diverse workplace.

We want to build a team of people who make conversations rich with perspective and experience. We are committed to listening to every voice in order to learn and grow because doing this will allow us to meet the needs of the diverse community of helpers that Jane serves.

We do not tolerate discrimination, prejudice, or oppressive isms of any kind. Employment is decided on the basis of qualifications, merit, experience, and the needs of the Jane community. We encourage anyone who requires accommodation or adjustments throughout the interview process to let us know, and we will do our best to support you.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We are big believers in innovating the banking experience because we believe Canadians deserve better options, and we challenge ourselves and our teams to creatively transform what’s possible in banking. Our team is made up of inquisitive and agile minds that find smarter ways of doing things. If you’re not afraid of taking on big challenges and redefining the future, you belong with us. You’ll get to work with people who will encourage you to reach new heights. We like to keep things fun, ask questions and learn together.

We are a big (and growing!) family. Overall we serve more than 670,000 people across Canada through Equitable Bank, Canada's Challenger Bank™, and have been around for more than 50 years. Equitable Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary, Concentra Bank, supports credit unions across Canada that serve more than six million members. Together we have over $125 billion in combined assets under management and administration, with a clear mandate to drive change in Canadian banking to enrich people's lives. Our customers have named our EQ Bank digital platform (eqbank.ca) one of the top banks in Canada on the Forbes World's Best Banks list since 2021.

The Work

As a Senior Analyst, Enterprise Data Governance, you will serve as the ambassador of EDG group, and work closely with many teams across EQB on implementation and oversight of enterprise data engagement and governance policy, goals, standards, practices, processes, and change management. You will also engage with Business and Technology leadership to improve the quality and value of enterprise data assets, respond to regulatory requirements as well as support the strategic requirements of the organization.

Main Activities:


Support the development, application and deployment of data policies and processes and influence Business Units to adopt Data Governance best practices
Support data stakeholders in maintaining Enterprise Business Glossary and other associated metadata by facilitating application of best practices, processes, and procedures
Ensure the application of Data Quality guidance and controls throughout the data lifecycle, with a focus on continuous data and process improvement
Prepare and deliver status updates on Data Quality by developing and updating an executive dashboard through the development and application of KPIs
Certify that all the metadata entered in the Data Governance tool is correct and validated by the data owner (including Business Glossary definitions) and maintain an inventory of Data Controls
Contribute to maintenance and ongoing evolution of data governance framework, policies, standards, and associated processes to support program objectives
Support the development and delivery of Data Steward training and internal accreditation, and facilitate adoption of enterprise DG tool by the business
Lead the development and delivery of internal data literacy training programs, as required
Collaborate with Business to ensure that data-related business requirements for governing data are clearly defined, communicated, and well understood, and considered during project prioritization and planning
Lead various assessments across the enterprise to support compliance with Canadian regulatory requirements
Other critical tasks as identified from time to time




Let’s Talk About You!


5-7 years of experience in the data industry with 5+ years towards delivering DG initiatives
Post-Secondary education, preferably in Technology or Business-related fields
Good understanding of “Data Governance” as a data discipline and the theory behind it
Demonstrated knowledge and skills in Enterprise Data Management, DG practices, and DQ principles and methodologies
Experience with any Data Governance tools (e.g., Collibra, OvalEdge, Apache Atlas, etc.)
Advance SQL skills are required to be successful in this role
Strong communication skills with the ability to articulate technical issues clearly and concisely to a non-technical audience
A strong believer in quality and excellence
Possess good business acumen
Business domain knowledge in Canadian Online and/or Retail Banking is mandatory
Ability to adapt to change and to detect and respond to evolving business needs
Good understanding of Compliance (FCAC), and Regulatory (OSFI, CDIC) regulations and policies

Knowledge of Power BI or Tableau
Knowledge of Atlassian (Confluence and JIRA)

Accountability:

This role will have crucial impacts on integrity and accuracy of the Bank’s internal and external financial statements and other reports. E.g., failure to detect a data error in Data Warehouse could lead to a material inaccuracy or discrepancy in the reported figures to external regulators and government agencies.

The role is also critical to successful execution of the Bank’s DG program. Failure to deliver on these accountabilities could negatively impact the business and their ability to deliver on stated strategy efficiently, which may potentially affect the overall financial success of the bank. Therefore, the selected candidate will need to ensure that the data used for financial reporting and supporting legal requirements is valid, reliable, traceable, timely, available, secure, and consistent.

Citylitics delivers predictive intelligence on local utility & public infrastructure markets

What is Infrastructure? It is the roadways you rely on to safely get to Grandma's house, it's the potable water that comes out of your kitchen tap that you wash your family's food with and it's the energy that heats our homes and powers our digital lifestyles.

Every year, trillions of dollars are spent on all areas of infrastructure to maintain our quality life and move our economy forward. However, our infrastructure is no longer equipped to meet the needs of the future. We hear about infrastructure failures, whether bridge collapses, power blackouts, or water main breaks, every day in the news. Climate change and extreme weather events are disrupting the basic infrastructure we took for granted for years.

Citylitics is solving the hardest data problems in infrastructure while building the sales intelligence platform that enables a faster, more transparent, and more efficient infrastructure marketplace. We turn millions of unstructured documents into high value intelligence feeds and datasets that are available on an intuitive user experience. Our goal is to enable solution providers to connect with cities with relevant infrastructure needs in a faster and more digital way than historic market channels. As more companies adopt our platform, cities & utilities will be able to access solutions that deliver on the promise of moving towards a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable infrastructure future.

Who Are We Looking For?

We're looking for a skilled and enthusiastic Data Engineer to join our growing team! We're a close-knit group building and maintaining mission-critical data pipelines, and we need someone who can hit the ground running.

This role requires a solid understanding of and experience with Apache Airflow. You'll be responsible for designing, building, and maintaining both streaming and batch data pipelines, leveraging various technologies we already use, including Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services like Dataflow, BigQuery, and Vertex AI. Experience with these specific GCP services is a must.

We're not looking for just someone who knows these tools, but someone who has built with them - ideally, complex and robust data pipelines in a production environment. We're interested in seeing examples of your work, so please be prepared to discuss past projects and challenges you've overcome.

Beyond the technical skills, we value collaboration, a proactive approach to problem-solving, and a willingness to learn and adapt to evolving technologies. If you're passionate about data engineering, thrive in a collaborative environment, and are excited by the prospect of working on impactful projects, we encourage you to apply.

What Will You Accomplish?


Design, build, and maintain: Develop and deploy highly scalable and reliable data pipelines using Apache Airflow, Dataflow, and other GCP services. This includes everything from initial design and development through testing, deployment, and ongoing maintenance
Data Modeling & Optimization: Collaborate with data analysts and stakeholders to define data requirements, and design efficient and effective data models within BigQuery. You'll be optimizing queries and pipeline performance for maximum efficiency
Monitoring & Troubleshooting: Implement robust monitoring and alerting for data pipelines. Proactively identify and resolve issues, ensuring data quality and pipeline uptime
Collaboration & Communication: Work closely with other engineers, data scientists, and product teams to understand business requirements and translate them into technical solutions. Clearly communicate technical details and project progress
Continuous Improvement: Contribute to the ongoing improvement of our data infrastructure and processes, including suggesting and implementing new technologies and best practices. We're always looking for ways to optimize our workflows and improve efficiency
Other duties as assigned.



Technologies We Use:


Backend: Python, Django, Cloud SQL and Airflow/Cloud Composer as the main language, web framework, database and orchestration tool respectively
Cloud Infrastructure: Google Cloud Platform
Other Tools: Dash & Plotly as the main framework for our dashboards hosted in Cloud Run



Requirements


Proven experience (2+ years) building and maintaining data pipelines using Apache Airflow. We're particularly interested in seeing examples of complex pipeline orchestration
Strong understanding of data warehousing principles and experience working with BigQuery
Experience with cloud-based data processing frameworks like Apache Beam (ideally with Google Cloud Dataflow)
Familiarity with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, specifically BigQuery, Dataflow, and Vertex AI. Experience with other GCP services is a plus
Proficiency in at least one scripting language (Python preferred)
Experience with version control systems (Git)
Excellent problem-solving skills and a proactive approach to identifying and resolving issues
Good communication and collaboration skills - you'll be working closely with other engineers and stakeholders
Understanding of data modeling concepts and best practices
Experience with CI/CD pipelines is a plus



Benefits

Why Citylitics?


Opportunity to work for one of the top 15 innovative analytics startups in Canada revolutionizing data intelligence
This is a rare opportunity to influence positive change within one of the biggest societal challenges of our generation: sustainable public infrastructure
You get to support a disruptive solution with a compelling value proposition into an industry that is eager to hear from you and in a market with no direct competition
We live at the cross section of infrastructure, scaleup and data science/AI. There is no other team like us in Toronto
There is no corporate bureaucracy here. You will accomplish more here in a few months than what you would in a few years at a large, entrenched technology company
We believe that Data and AI will play an outsized role in our future, so we equip every team member with access to Generative AI tools and our full Data Universe to enhance their productivity and encourage innovation through experimentation
We are proud to offer every CityZen an internal mentorship program, in-role professional growth, skill-based development & learning, and internal promotion opportunities
