Analytics is the compass that guides Sephora on its strategic journey, and we are on the lookout for a Data Analyst who can harness the power of data to propel our business forward. As a Data Analyst, you'll play a critical role in analyzing and interpreting customer data to drive business decisions across our digital platforms. Leveraging your strong experience in BigQuery SQL, you'll craft scripts that seamlessly integrate back-end data with Google Analytics 4 for in-depth customer analysis and segmentation.




Your expertise in data modeling will enable you to map out data structures that support the creation and maintenance of dashboards and reports, tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) related to online engagement, traffic, conversion rates, and marketing effectiveness. In this role, you'll work with data visualization tools like Power BI and Google Data Studio to develop compelling visual reports that convey complex insights in a clear and actionable manner. Additionally, you'll ensure the accuracy and quality of data, while effectively communicating your insights to non-technical stakeholders.




You will also be responsible for:

Writing and optimizing BigQuery SQL scripts for GA4 analysis, integrating back-end data to segment and analyze customer data.
Developing and maintaining dashboards and regular weekly/monthly reports to track KPIs related to performance, online engagement, A/B testing, traffic, conversion rates, marketing attribution, and campaign effectiveness.
Using data visualization tools such as Power BI and Google Data Studio to create clear, actionable insights for stakeholders.
Engaging in data modeling to effectively map out data structures that support business goals.
Utilizing digital analytics tools like Google Analytics and Quantum Metric to deliver data-driven recommendations.
Ensuring the accuracy and quality of data while drawing insightful conclusions and making strategic recommendations.




What You'll Bring




Your passion for detail is matched by your logical thinking and curiosity. You not only obsess over details but also possess the agility to communicate improvements rapidly and clearly. You thrive in an ever-evolving landscape, where driving innovation and continuous improvement is paramount. We are looking for a detail-oriented Data Analyst with strong analytical skills, capable of working both independently and collaboratively within a dynamic team environment.

We value ambition paired with a logical mindset—individuals who are curious, inquisitive, and able to articulate suggestions with precision. You will utilize your strong foundation in BigQuery SQL, particularly in GA4 analysis, coupled with hands-on experience in data visualization using tools like Power BI. Your deep understanding of digital analytics, especially within Ecommerce and Retail, will enable you to provide actionable insights that drive business success. Your proficiency in digital analytics tools such as Google Analytics and Quantum Metric will be essential in providing recommendations that optimize performance.




Our ideal candidate will also possess:

Proficiency in Google Analytics, Quantum Metric, or similar digital analytics platforms.
Experience with Google Marketing Platform.
Strong communication skills, both written and verbal, for conveying complex data insights to non-technical stakeholders.
An eye for detail and a commitment to data accuracy and quality.
Familiarity with Google Tag Manager, A/B testing tools, competitor research using market share tools, setting up data feed APIs, and UX platforms would be advantageous.




While at Sephora, You’ll Enjoy...




The people. You will be surrounded by some of the most talented leaders and teams – people you can be proud to work with.
The learning. We invest in training and developing our teams, and you will continue evolving and building your skills through personalized career plans.

We are looking for a Data Analyst that is passionate about metrics and telling the stories behind the data. We have several roles open across different teams (grocery, loyalty, restaurants). Data Analysts at Deliveroo report into our data science management team.

You will be a professional in insights storytelling, communication and visualisation and know how to create action from metrics.

Work closely with commercial stakeholders to create value and business impact through better data availability, visualisation and analysis
Discover, analyse, and interpret trends or patterns in complex datasets to perform ad-hoc analyses and deliver insights to the executive team and senior management

A good understanding of querying in SQL and understanding of database structure - you'll be expected to be able to extract the data you need for your analysis.
Compelling story-telling skills, and an eye for powerful visualisations - you'll need to translate your findings for all levels of stakeholder (business and technical)
Good knowledge of Excel/GSheets - depending on the task, there is a good chance that this is where some of your exploratory analysis will take place. Being comfortable with pivot tables and functions will be essential.

Institutions and investors are now free to earn more from what they own.




Every Sharegainer has their own backstory, but we all share an ambition to do things differently – bigger, better, and greater. Together we’re on a mission to democratize capital markets by building a more liquid world. The more we share, the more we all gain.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.
