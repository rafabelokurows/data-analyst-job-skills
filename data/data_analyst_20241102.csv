We’re a company on a mission - We are a unique Canadian Fintech that is the one stop shop for all financial needs of the consumer - Save, Spend, Borrow, Invest, and Protect. Every single team member, from product & engineering to sales & marketing, finance, operations, and everything in between is obsessed with one thing; helping Canadians make better financial choices. And we’re pretty great at it, too. Via our digital application technology and our award-winning in-house brokerages, we help over 2M Canadians per month make a positive impact on their finances. We have many unique businesses - a mortgage brokerage, a life insurance brokerage, a home and auto insurance brokerage, a mortgage originations and servicing business, a Financial Services Marketplace and a content business across Ratehub and MoneySense. 365 days a year we deliver our users the best online mortgage experience, personalized Credit Card and Loans options, and cheaper auto & home insurance policies than they typically get from their existing financial adviser.

Changing how people make financial choices isn’t easy, though. We know that achieving our mission is full of challenges; challenges that can be complex and often unexpected, but that are always interesting, rewarding, and fun to solve as a team. This is where you come in. We are on the hunt for the right kind of people to join us and help lead us forward to continued growth.

We have a newly created Data Team that is capturing data, analyzing it, harvesting it, modeling it to provide meaningful insights to our Members and to our businesses. We’re looking for a top performing Data Analyst to join this team, which will be the backbone of all the businesses (based in downtown Toronto but also open to remote candidates)! Reporting to the Head of Data, the Data Analyst is a critical member of Ratehub’s team who will drive decision making across the company. You will work on high impact projects with business stakeholders and will need to use data to solve long-term and immediate business problems. The role will involve data analysis, modeling and insights development. The ideal candidate has strong communications skills, a passion for data, a background in quantitative analysis and an interest in personal finance. You will get the opportunity to work closely with the other analysts in the team as well as the business stakeholders to learn different parts of the business and provide valuable support with data reporting and analysis across various business units.

Collaborate with business partners on experimentation design and a/b testing
Drive org wide impact by shaping business strategy through data centric analysis and presentations


Your Qualifications


2+ years of relevant work experience

High proficiency with SQL for data analysis
Strong understanding of BI & reporting tools e.g. Looker, Tableau, Sisense, QlikView
Knowledge of Python or R is considered an asset
Experience with a web analytics tool to support product and marketing analysis will be an asset

Resourceful: You don’t have all the answers, but you know how to get them
Strong problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities
Adaptable to a fast paced environment and able to pivot quickly to align with changing priorities


CULTURE FIT:


No Ego: No task is too big or small. You are never afraid to ask questions when you are trying to learn and understand things. You have no problem rolling up your sleeves and helping to execute when the team needs help. This humility extends to all aspects of your work and interaction with teammates
Player Coach: You mentor and teach as you execute. You model the behaviour you expect from your team. You don’t just tell others what to do, you know and show how to do it at a high standard
Growth mindset: You have a desire to always continue to grow and learn. This means a willingness to get outside your comfort zone and try new things because you view these as opportunities to gain skills and knowledge
Helping Hand: You always offer to help without having to be asked. You go the extra mile to help out regardless of your team and function
Get S##T Done: Your bias is towards action. This means pitching in and rallying to get things across the finish line. Rather than putting off work ask yourself what you can do today to move the needle on a project or goal
Digs Deep: You aren't afraid to ask questions because you want to understand every issue so that you can properly solve the root cause of the problem instead of just completing the task you are given
