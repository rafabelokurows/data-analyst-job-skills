Senior Data Analyst, GTM Analytics

Why We Have This Role

The Senior Data Analyst acts as a consultant to both sales and company leadership. You are responsible for providing a wide range of strategic, analytical, and operational support across multiple global regions and sales teams. In this role you will be responsible for solving complex problems and generating data-driven insights that directly impact revenue and solve pain points within the sales ecosystem.

How You’ll Find Success


Data-oriented, with experience solving business problems using data tools and methodologies
Innately curious with a drive to solve problems at their core, not just answer surface-level questions and apply band-aid fixes
Able to collaborate with a variety of backgrounds across business and technical functions, both as partners and stakeholders
Focused on results, even if that occasionally requires work outside traditional analyst job responsibilities
Able to learn quickly and take initiative


How You’ll Grow


Grow your data analysis, problem solving, and communication skills across while developing expertise in sales and go-to-market operations
Learn how global sales, customer success, and marketing teams operate, and improve the data/systems/insights that drive their growth
Design processes and systems based on the insights you help uncover


Things You’ll Do


Help the Customer Success org operate more effectively by conducting quantitative research in key areas such as retention and churn analytics, product adoption analytics, forecasting, performance management, and territory design
Innovate proactively with your unique mix of data and business knowledge
Democratize insights by partnering with systems, operations, and analytics teams to design and build data delivery mechanisms (dashboards, automated reports, etc.)
Ensure data quality with automated, documented, tested data pipelines built in Python and SQL
Perform quantitative and qualitative analysis that leads to actionable insights, assisting stakeholders throughout the business on special projects and reports.
Handle inbound requests from field teams for data analysis, data requests, and decision making support. Proactively work with internal stakeholders to prioritize needs and/or requests on a weekly basis.
Transform complex data sets into actionable insights using analytical, visualization, and data tools such as Tableau, Excel, Python, R, MySQL, etc. Create queries, views, reports, and easy-to-consume dashboards/visualizations.
Own end-to-end problem solving efforts from the discovery & exploration phase through to implementation.
Own an entire area of go-to-market operations that flexes depending on need and urgency (ability to consult across the business): taking projects from start to finish with high quality and impact, acting as the “subject-matter-expert”, and collaborating with stakeholders to ensure the analytics are being used to drive business outcomes


What We’re Looking For On Your Resume


3-7 years conducting data analysis and proven track record of those insights driving business impact
3-7 years of designing and building dashboards used by large audiences for extended periods of time (Tableau preferred)
Preferred experience building robust data pipelines in Python and SQL across various data warehousing technologies (Redshift/Snowflake preferred) and system APIs (Salesforce, Qualtrics, Tableau, etc.)
Experience conducting innovative research in a business context
Experience collaborating with systems and operations teams to fully operationalize insights and democratize data
Experience working with a complex set of stakeholders, including executives, go-to-market field teams, and operations teams
Degree or relevant experience with a quantitative or systems focus (e.g. Informations Systems, Computer Science, STEM, Business Analytics, Finance, Data Science)

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Who you are

You’re passionate about solving complex business problems and making a direct impact on stakeholders. You are comfortable with dealing with many moving pieces, learning new technologies and systems, and you are excited about managing projects across multiple functions. This role gives you opportunities to work with data analysts, engineers, product managers, and business stakeholders. We're looking for someone who is self driven, has strong data analytics skills and great communication skills with good domain knowledge in Finance/Accounting.

Minimum Requirements


Bachelor's degree in STEM OR Business major (i.e. Computer Science, Math, Stat, Engineering, Finance, Accounting, Economics, MIS, etc.)
5+ years of prior working experience in data analysis fields
Strong analytical ability, proficiency with SQL (minimum of 3 years advanced SQL) and strong understanding of data relationships
Experience working with extremely large datasets

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $134,000 - $201,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

AWS Infrastructure Services owns the design, planning, delivery, and operation of all AWS global infrastructure. In other words, we’re the people who keep the cloud running. We support all AWS data centers and all of the servers, storage, networking, power, and cooling equipment that ensure our customers have continual access to the innovation they rely on. We work on the most challenging problems, with thousands of variables impacting the supply chain — and we’re looking for talented people who want to help.

You’ll join a diverse team of software, hardware, and network engineers, supply chain specialists, security experts, operations managers, and other vital roles. You’ll collaborate with people across AWS to help us deliver the highest standards for safety and security while providing seemingly infinite capacity at the lowest possible cost for our customers. And you’ll experience an inclusive culture that welcomes bold ideas and empowers you to own them to completion.

Do you want to be an integral part of the world's transition to the cloud? The AWS Analytics and Data Solutions (ADS) team is seeking for a Business Analyst (BA) with a combination of superior analytical abilities, business acumen, business judgement, curiosity, technical skills, and written and verbal communication skills to join our team.

Data-driven decision-making is at the core of Amazon’s culture and people who are exceptionally talented at analyzing large sets of data to build insights are critical. Your work will directly impact the decisions and strategy of the entire AWS Infrastructure Services org and our customers. You will be gathering customer needs and insights, mining large and diverse data sets from across AWS Infrastructure, building visualizations and tools for our business partners, generating insights to help senior leaders make critical business decisions. As a Business Analyst, you will work with ADS Infra Team's key stakeholders to leverage our data to drive operational efficiencies, provide key data-driven insights, enable new opportunities and innovate on behalf of our stakeholders.

The business analyst must be a self-starter, comfortable with ambiguity, able to think big and be creative (while still paying careful attention to detail), and enjoy working in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. If you are excited about data, are results-oriented, and want to join a growing analytics team within Amazon - this role is for you!
