People deserve more from their money. More visibility, more control, and more freedom. Since 2015, Revolut has been on a mission to deliver just that. Our powerhouse of products — including spending, saving, investing, exchanging, travelling, and more — help our 50+ million customers get more from their money every day.

As we continue our lightning-fast growth,‌ 2 things are essential to our success: our people and our culture. In recognition of our outstanding employee experience, we've been certified as a Great Place to Work™. So far, we have 10,000+ people working around the world, from our offices and remotely, to help us achieve our mission. And we're looking for more brilliant people. People who love building great products, redefining success, and turning the complexity of a chaotic world into the simplicity of a beautiful solution.

About The Role

We approach Data Science at Revolut the same way that we approach everything else. We take complex problems and create extraordinary solutions that our customers love. Our Data Analysts aren’t kept in the background, doomed to never see the impact of their work. They’re some of our best and brightest problem solvers, deployed to the front-lines to work in Product teams and deliver rock star solutions.

About The Rev-Celerator Graduate Programme 🎓

Are you a recent graduate eager to shape the future of finance? Ready to make a meaningful impact and bring innovative ideas to life? Well, the Rev-celerator Graduate Data Analyst programme is designed just for you.

First, kick off with a few weeks of bootcamp, where we’ll prepare you to jump into work at Revolut with workshops, lectures, and practical exercises to start developing your skills. After successful preparation, we’ll launch you into on-the-job training where you’ll be face-to-face with tough challenges, problem-solving, and tasks to own.

The Rev-celerator Graduate Programme is now open to international candidates willing to relocate to one of our tech hubs in Poland, Portugal, and Spain. Get support on visa application (if needed), relocation costs, and the first month of accommodation.

We’re looking for a Data Analyst who doesn’t believe there’s a data task that can be too hard. From digging into our complex databases, looking for the root cause of a problem to designing their own solutions and writing their own code to implement them. In this process, they never stop learning, picking up new skills, and delivering value ✨
