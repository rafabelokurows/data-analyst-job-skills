Pine Walk Capital is a business platform helping insurance teams to grow. Pine Walk provides a wrap-around set of support functions and delivers best in class service across executive management, consultancy, finance, compliance, and IT. Pine Walk works with highly motivated niche insurance teams that deal in complicated and innovative transactions. Pine Walk is on a high growth trajectory which is giving rise to opportunities and new roles across the team.




Job Summary

This role offers an exciting opportunity to fast-track your career in an aggressively ambitious business. The role’s broad scope provides high exposure to the business, visibility over Group processes and systems, and exposure to and collaboration with highly skilled professionals.




The primary purpose of the role is to design, develop, and optimize SQL queries, stored procedures, and database architectures to solve business problems. This includes writing and maintaining efficient SQL code for data retrieval, manipulation, and reporting, as well as automating recurring database tasks. The role also involves performance tuning, ensuring data integrity, and managing datasets to optimise database performance and scalability. You'll collaborate closely with other developers and teams to integrate SQL solutions with applications and ensure seamless data flow.




Location

Pine Walk is part of the wider Fidelis Partnership Group – with offices across London, Belgium, Ireland, and Bermuda. This role will be based in the Croydon office with 1x day per week in the London City office.




Key Responsibilities

1. Create, optimise, and maintain SQL queries and stored procedures for efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and reporting.

2. Analyse and optimise database performance through indexing, query optimisation, and other techniques to ensure high efficiency and scalability.

3. Work with third parties to deliver integrations that are robust and effective, to reduce manual processing/re-keying of data.

4. Automate recurring database processes such as data imports, exports, and scheduled jobs to improve workflow efficiency.

5. Analyse data to provide both reports and insight using a range of technologies including SQL, Python and Power Platform.

6. Document and demonstrate solutions by developing documentation, flowcharts, layouts, diagrams, etc.

7. Manage data collection processes with the MGA’s or third parties – ensuring processes are documented and data is delivered to an appropriate level of quality.

8. Manage and review the tasks of the junior data analysts – developing into the line manager for junior data analysts.

9. Working with the rest of the Pine Walk data team ensure that infrastructures and environments are appropriately sized and structured.

10. Any other duties assigned by your line manager relevant to the role/time.




Our Stack

Pine Walk works completely in the cloud to ensure we are flexible and ready for growth. Our Datawarehouse is built on Azure SQL combining data from third party databases and our own apps. The Power Platform is our reporting tool of choice alongside Excel but given the types of insurance involved other areas of data analysis and system design, e.g. Python, GIS, will need to be integrated into our solutions in the future.




Pine Walk is committed to exploring new technologies to automate processes and deliver effective working processes.




Essential Skills, Knowledge, and Experience

• Degree educated (minimum 2:1) in a numerate subject.

• Prior experience in SQL ( preferably 2+ years)

• Detail-orientated with excellent problem-solving skills.

• Personal drive and resilience in established and new/changing situations.

• Ability to support success and timely delivery in a complex, multi-disciplinary environment.

Carwow Group is driven by a passion for getting people into cars. But not just any car, the right car. That's why we are building the go-to destination for car-changing. Designed to reach drivers everywhere with our trail-blazing portfolio of personality rich automotive brands; Carwow, Auto Express, evo, Driving Electric and Car Buyer.

What started as a simple reviews site, is now one of the largest online car-changing destinations in Europe - over 10m customers have used Carwow to help them buy and sell cars since its inception. Last year we grew over 50% with nearly £3bn worth of cars bought on site, while £1.8bn of cars were listed for sale through our Sell My Car service.

In 2024 we went big and acquired Autovia, doubling our audience overnight. Together we now have one of the biggest YouTube channels in the world with over 1.1 billion annual views, sell 1.2 million print copies of our magazines and have an annual web content reach over 350million.

WHY JOIN US?

We are winners of the prestigious Culture 100 award that recognises the most loved and happiest tech companies to work for! We have just raised $52m in funding led by global venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners (an early backer of LinkedIn and Shopify) to accelerate our growth plans!

As pioneers, we're always driving for new territory and positive change, so our work as a group is never done. Where others see difficulty, it's our responsibility to see possibility - building new experiences, launching new titles and listening to drivers.

Being a part of Carwow Group means championing drivers and the automotive industry, acting as a disrupter and never being afraid to fail (but learning fast when we do!).

Our team of 500 employees across the UK, Germany, Spain and Portugal are revolutionising car-changing and we are fast expanding our mission across every single brand and country we operate in, so jump in!
