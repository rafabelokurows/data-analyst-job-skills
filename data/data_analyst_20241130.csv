As a member of a rapidly growing and evolving team, your responsibilities will include:

Independently explore data to uncover trends and anomalies relevant to the assignment.
Work closely with Support leadership to report on key business metrics to spot trends and answer important questions

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Working At TuneCore

Our Values

TuneCore is a team of creators, for creators. Our mission is to support our artists and labels at every stage of their careers. Our driving forces are fairness, expertise, respect and transparency.

As part of our commitment to gender equity in the industry, TuneCore and Believe partnered with leading marketing intelligence and consulting firm MIDiA Research in 2021 for a groundbreaking study on the underrepresentation of female creators in the music industry.

For the fourth annual study, BE THE CHANGE: Gender Equity in Music, MIDiA Research surveyed more than 4,100 members of the music industry—with a predominant focus on creators—in an effort to better understand their struggles and provide tangible strategies to help them overcome their challenges. Our intent for this study is to inspire meaningful change in the industry.
