We help the world see new possibilities and inspire change for better tomorrows. Our analytic solutions bridge content, data, and analytics to help business, people, and society become stronger, more resilient, and sustainable.

Job Description

The ISO unit of Verisk is looking for Junior Insurance Data Analysts to support our large team of actuaries and data analytics experts, who create innovative analytic products based on our unique database of over 21 billion records spanning more than twenty lines of insurance.

You will play a hands-on role in developing new processes to create a wide variety of ISO’s analytic solutions including: our advisory prospective loss costs and rating factors; analyses that underlie the development of our loss costs (such as distributions by peril, classification or geographic area); actuarial projection of ultimate claims, and analysis of trends impacting premiums and claims; analytical data management, including smart data quality analytics, data aggregations provided to US state insurance regulators and analytic research & development.

A successful Insurance Data Analyst will possess excellent technical and mathematical skills, to work with data and derive analyses. Most important, though, is a sense of inquisitiveness about data, and the ability not just to manipulate data, but to also understand and preserve the business meaning behind it.

Qualifications


Strong analytical, problem-solving and decision-making skills with a technical mindset
Practical knowledge of SQL
Practical experience with using Python
Good presentation and public speaking skills with a focus on internal stakeholders are crucial
Fluency in English is required (C1 spoken and written)

Understanding of Data Engineering concept and processes
Familiarity with PowerBI or Sigma in building effective data visualization dashboards would be a strong asset
Willingness to work in a hybrid model from our Cracow Office as a full-time employee.
