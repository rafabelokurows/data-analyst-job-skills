🌎 What we do

We build software that helps companies along the food system get to Net Zero.

~31% of global GHG emissions originate from food-related activities. For the first time in history, climate performance has become an overall business performance indicator. Enterprises are mandated by regulatory bodies to disclose their climate performance, which leads to increasing pressure from investors, competitors, retailers, and consumers to prevent and reduce their CO2e emissions. Over the next 10 years, companies have set ambitious reduction targets that need to be met. Enterprise software and new business processes can help.

We raised >€10m in funding in the first 2 years of our existence, we launched our enterprise product, signed and onboarded some of the largest F&B players in Europe, and put together what we believe is the best-suited early stage tech team in Europe. Will you be the next to join us? 🚀

🔭 What you will work on

Your mission

Help our users make sense of their data and pave the way to Net Zero Emissions.

Over the next 12 months you will:


Create Actionable Insights for Net Zero
Identify data patterns to help users understand and communicate their carbon footprints more effectively to customers and suppliers.
Turn emission data into clear, impactful insights for users so they can make better decisions.
Bridge data to real-world measures - our users and farmers don’t live in spreadsheets.
Build Prototypes and Products
Develop models and prototypes to help clients set targets and model Net Zero scenarios.
Develop a strong understanding of our users and their unique challenges.
Work closely with the product team to transform prototypes into scalable SaaS products.
Upskill the Team with Data & AI
Stay up-to-date with the latest trends in data analytics and AI product building.
Empower self-service across teams.
Foster a data-first culture in a fast-growing environment where it’s easy to simply listen to your gut feeling.

🚀 You might be really good for this role if


You have a ""get-it-done"" attitude and the ability to learn really fast.
You have a passion for putting together quick, hacky prototypes that you can put in front of users.
You understand and care equally as much about the “why” behind the numbers, you think outcome-first.
You constantly try out the latest AI tools and have experience building with no-code or low-code platforms like Airtable or Retool.
You were part of the first 20-30 employees at an early stage technology company.
You are highly reliable and can organise your work really well.


You don't feel like you fulfil all the criteria? We get it: confidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. But guess what?! There is no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. The only thing you need to ensure along the recruiting process and beyond is that the problem that we are solving with Root is one you cannot wait to get out of bed for on Monday morning! 🤗

🦾 How we support you


You will report directly to our co-founder: Eric
You will get mentored and coached by one of our angel investors and one of the best AI product builders in Europe: Tevfik


🎢 Hiring Process

Our ambition is to offer you an end-to-end experience that is fast and uncomplicated - we aim to keep the end-to-end process to 10 working days. We send you prep material for each step and maximise transparency at every step.

Über unseren seit 2022 bestehenden Bereich Enpal Dragon haben wir nun auch eine nachhaltige Heizlösung in unserem Ökosystem ergänzt - die Wärmepumpe als Alternative zu fossilen Brennstoffen.

Octopus Energy UK 🇬🇧 – Data /

Full-time /

Hybrid



At Octopus, our mission is to decarbonise the energy system as quickly as possible. Households are critical in driving the next phase of decarbonisation, through the way we travel and heat our homes.

The Low Carbon Tech (LCT) team sits inside the Octopus Energy group, where its sole purpose is to drive the uptake of technologies combatting the effects of climate change - including Heat Pumps, Solar panels and EV chargers. The team focuses on the end-to-end customer journey of purchasing, installing and monitoring the technologies.

What does it mean to be part of the LCT data team?

The Octopus data team builds tools, pipelines, analysis and machine learning products across the business - we are organised so that each team or ‘pod’ is embedded within and focused upon a specific domain - the LCT data team is dedicated to the Low Carbon Tech business. The data team work closely with other pods to maintain the different tools we build - it’s a collaborative environment and we encourage everyone in the team

A little heads-up: With some of our team taking some well-deserved annual leave over the next couple of weeks, we may not get around to carefully reviewing all applications until the new year. Every application gets reviewed by a real human, and we’ll be in touch to let you know either way—whether it’s a yes or, sadly, a no this time round. Thanks for your patience and understanding!

What You'll Do...


Work closely with LCT leadership team, empowering them to make data-driven decision to accelerate the uptake of low carbon technologies
Embed the use of data within the organisation across all levels - making dashboards impactful, engaging and accessible
Improve the efficiency of the LCT organisation - analysing the factors influencing the utilisation of engineers and conversion of sales
Communicate findings and recommendations to senior management and stakeholders



What You'll Need...


Ideally 4+ years of professional experience
Adept at problem solving and communicating answers to business partners
Managed relationships with senior stakeholders and management
Passionate about working in energy and contributing to the energy transition
Curious and self-driven - when faced with a new problem is capable of seeking out an answer without lots of help and support
Highly data literate and numerate - can make sense of lots of data and shape it into a coherent story
Has great attention to detail
Communicates complex ideas clearly



Experience with some of the below technologies:


A scripting language (ideally Python with pandas)
Wrangling data outside of a spreadsheet environment
Writing performant queries in SQL / dbt
Building reports and dashboards in a BI tool (ideally Tableau or Streamlit)
Is passionate about building robust and useable tools



You must...


Be comfortable working with some ambiguity: The LCT team is busy scaling and as such specific responsibilities, projects and focus will evolve over time
Be curious and self driven - it’s essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
Be highly data literate and numerate - can make sense of lots of data and shape it into a coherent structure
Be a problem solver - you’ll need to be able to listen and understand the problems and requirements of the business and come up with pragmatic data solutions



If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!

Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.

You will be working directly with the senior stakeholders in the firm to understand what insights they are looking to gain, then build reports and dashboards using SQL and PowerBI.




Alongside this, you’ll spend the other half of your time analysing the ESG data and markets, looking for ways you can influence and impact the firm’s performance.




This is a relatively junior role, so while you may have some experience with PowerBI, Tableau or SSRS, this is an opportunity to develop those skills further and progress into a Senior position over the next few years.




The Investment Manager has roughly $110 billion AUM and has been identified as one of the fastest growing globally over the last year – which will provide even more opportunities for progression within the role.

What’s Next?

Improve our day to day toolbox of reporting/dashboards establishing a single source of truth for metrics that matter, and equipping teams with the ability to self serve where possible
Work with our leads to deliver data analysis across our funnel & patient experience, to help them make key decisions about our product & business model
Incrementing on our global data model with a strong focus on UK use cases. You will work closely with our central analytics function in AU to ensure that any modelling is standardised and transferrable to our other brands and other markets

Ambiguity & a fast-paced environment excites you - your curiosity drives you to ask ‘why?’ to get to the next level of understanding; and you can work at speed
You see more than the data - you have strong business / commercial acumen, and get to the ‘so what’ based on the analysis you do. You help shape the right analysis for the decision at hand
Attention to detail - you have a high bar for ‘correct’, and work through nuances in the data to surface when an insight can be relied on and when it can’t



So, why join Eucalyptus?

You proactively identify patterns, risks, and opportunities to build scalable, data-driven solutions

You're structured and like organisation
You've an excellent work ethic and can manage workloads well
You are able to work effectively within a remote team, it can have its challenges



To be successful in this role, your values matter just as much as skills. Does this sound like you? ✨

🟢We are Kind and Empathetic = Our behaviour and words assume the best in people

🟢We are Always A Team = We are bound together by accountability

🟢We are Curious = A bunch from various backgrounds. We ask questions, plan things out, push the boundaries, challenge the status quo and welcome creativity

🟢We Take Ownership & Deliver = We are focused on our goals and love the details

✅Why work for Vable?


You want ownership of the Data Analytics within Vable
We have a culture that we protect, we value the contributions each Vabler makes
We encourage constant learning so you can keep up to date. A yearly budget of £250 is made available to each Vable employee for continuous learning and development
We encourage creativity and like new ideas and concentrate on the Cultural Add, not fit
We provide comprehensive healthcare cover following probation
You receive a MacBook, monitor and other required technical equipment when you join
33 days of paid leave a year inclusive of statutory holidays, based on where you live
Access to an Employee Assistance Programme through Oliva
We like our virtual socials and really do like to get to know everyone in the team

❌Why it may not be for you:


We are a 40 hour week, Mon-Fri and have core hours, unless stated otherwise or agreed. Being a small remote team, it's how we operate

We have various meetings per week and people are expected to attend and contribute
Our roles are quite generalist and you will be expected to do areas that you perhaps don't like or feel is not your job. No Vabler has this attitude and we get stuck in and pull our sleeves up. If this isn't you, best not apply.
Everyone has the opportunity to query, ask questions, have new ideas and we will give you our opinion. We operate on continuous feedback and recognition. This isn't for everyone and if this makes you uncomfortable or it's not your thing, this may not be the right fit
We are very transparent and all work is stored on shared drives. Colleagues will give input and it's expected that you will actively adhere to this approach

Carwow Group is driven by a passion for getting people into cars. But not just any car, the right car. That's why we are building the go-to destination for car-changing. Designed to reach drivers everywhere with our trail-blazing portfolio of personality rich automotive brands; Carwow, Auto Express, evo, Driving Electric and Car Buyer.

What started as a simple reviews site, is now one of the largest online car-changing destinations in Europe - over 10m customers have used Carwow to help them buy and sell cars since its inception. Last year we grew over 50% with nearly £3bn worth of cars bought on site, while £1.8bn of cars were listed for sale through our Sell My Car service.

In 2024 we went big and acquired Autovia, doubling our audience overnight. Together we now have one of the biggest YouTube channels in the world with over 1.1 billion annual views, sell 1.2 million print copies of our magazines and have an annual web content reach over 350million.

WHY JOIN US?

We are winners of the prestigious Culture 100 award that recognises the most loved and happiest tech companies to work for! We have just raised $52m in funding led by global venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners (an early backer of LinkedIn and Shopify) to accelerate our growth plans!

As pioneers, we're always driving for new territory and positive change, so our work as a group is never done. Where others see difficulty, it's our responsibility to see possibility - building new experiences, launching new titles and listening to drivers.

Being a part of Carwow Group means championing drivers and the automotive industry, acting as a disrupter and never being afraid to fail (but learning fast when we do!).

Octopus Energy UK 🇬🇧 – Data /

Full-time /

Hybrid



At Octopus, we’ve led the way in innovating new ways to price energy to give customers more control over their energy costs, stamp out the loyalty penalty seen in much of the industry and engage customers to use energy when it is greenest and cheapest. We’re looking for a smart, passionate analyst to join the pricing and commercial function within our data team to help us manage and develop our energy products, and understand customer choices.

Our team takes a technology- and data-driven approach to managing our complex pricing portfolio and sales channels. We apply modern open data and analytics tools like Python, Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks to build pricing tools and customer behaviour models. We’re passionate about automating workloads and processes so we can concentrate on the interesting problems. We’re looking for someone who is equally motivated by using technology to solve problems.

This is a fantastic opportunity to work on problems that genuinely move us closer to Net Zero with a company that is passionate about building great technology and products that change the way customers use energy.

A little heads-up: With some of our team taking some well-deserved annual leave over the next couple of weeks, we may not get around to carefully reviewing all applications until the new year. Every application gets reviewed by a real human, and we’ll be in touch to let you know either way—whether it’s a yes or, sadly, a no this time round. Thanks for your patience and understanding!

What You'll Do...


Produce regular reports and deliver insight into sales and losses, across our different sales channels
Perform competitor and market analysis
Analyse customer switching behaviour and influences (internal e.g. tariff choice or contract renewals; and external e.g. competitor pricing or house moves)
Support operational reporting to monitor and improve growth across our acquisition channels (e.g. commissions reporting, sales incentive performance)
Execute and optimise tariff reprices according to our pricing principles
Build tools and pricing dashboards to visualise product offerings and report margins
Work closely with a broad range of teams including Cost, Procurement, Strategy, Sales and Marketing teams
Provide regulatory and policy support on switching and pricing



What You'll Need...


We don’t need prior energy supplier experience (we can teach that), although experience working in energy retail is a bonus.
Ideally 2 years of professional experience
To be passionate about working in energy and contributing to the energy transition
To be curious and self-driven - when faced with a new problem is capable of seeking out an answer without lots of help and support
To be highly data literate and numerate - can make sense of lots of data and shape it into a coherent story
To have great attention to detail
To communicate complex ideas clearly



You will also need to have experience with some of the below technologies:


A scripting language (ideally Python with pandas)
Wrangling data outside of a spreadsheet environment
Writing performant queries in SQL / dbt
Building reports and dashboards in a BI tool (ideally Tableau or Streamlit)
To be passionate about building robust and useable tools



If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!

Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.

Duration: 6 months with possible extension

Pay rate: negotiable (PAYE or Umbrella - Inside IR35)

Who are the GO-Tech team?

GO-Tech (Global Operations Technologies) are part of the company's Technology group and are responsible for the software and hardware solutions which run physical operations, globally. Their area of focus encompasses four main pillars:

This is a hands-on role and will require somebody with a strong appreciation of databases, scripting, and/or macros to automate as much as possible of the data mapping activity. There will also be a significant manual element to this activity, which will require careful judgement and attention to detail while working through large data sets.




This a great opportunity to provide substantial value to a highly visible project.




Key Responsibilities

Take ownership of the datasets.
Devise methods for matching on suitable attributes.
Update the source data sets with unique employee IDs for every employee.
Document and share your findings with other team members, including appropriate external vendors.
Proactively highlight issues and concerns to the project team.
Collaborate with application and database teams to prepare the source datasets.
Provide regular status updates, including progress reports, identified risks, issues and concerns.




About You

As a Data Analyst, you will be passionate about your work and problem solving, with a motivation to deliver results quickly and effectively.
Proven prior experience in successfully analysing and manipulating large data sets.
Knowledge of SQL, Excel Macros, and other scripting tools.
Passionate about your work and problem solving, flexible, resilient, driven and committed. Exhibiting a strong team orientation, with an innately proactive and not reactive approach to work.
Highly self-motivated, reliable & able to work with limited supervision.

Sharegain began with one question: If the largest institutions solely exercise the right to lend their stocks, bonds, and ETFs, what would it take to unlock this revenue opportunity for every investor?




Our team of experts in the UK, US and Israel built the solution: a platform that empowers online brokers, private banks, and wealth managers to offer securities lending to their clients. We call it SLaaS: Securities Lending as a Service. It’s a fully digital, customizable, end-to-end solution that automates front- and back-office operations. Institutions and investors are now free to earn more from what they own.




Every Sharegainer has their own backstory, but we all share an ambition to do things differently – bigger, better, and greater. Together we’re on a mission to democratize capital markets by building a more liquid world. The more we share, the more we all gain.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.
