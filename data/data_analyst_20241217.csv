Octopus Energy UK 🇬🇧 – Data /

Full-time /

Hybrid



At Octopus, our mission is to decarbonise the energy system as quickly as possible. Households are critical in driving the next phase of decarbonisation, through the way we travel and heat our homes.

The Low Carbon Tech (LCT) team sits inside the Octopus Energy group, where its sole purpose is to drive the uptake of technologies combatting the effects of climate change - including Heat Pumps, Solar panels and EV chargers. The team focuses on the end-to-end customer journey of purchasing, installing and monitoring the technologies.

What does it mean to be part of the LCT data team?

The Octopus data team builds tools, pipelines, analysis and machine learning products across the business - we are organised so that each team or ‘pod’ is embedded within and focused upon a specific domain - the LCT data team is dedicated to the Low Carbon Tech business. The data team work closely with other pods to maintain the different tools we build - it’s a collaborative environment and we encourage everyone in the team

A little heads-up: With some of our team taking some well-deserved annual leave over the next couple of weeks, we may not get around to carefully reviewing all applications until the new year. Every application gets reviewed by a real human, and we’ll be in touch to let you know either way—whether it’s a yes or, sadly, a no this time round. Thanks for your patience and understanding!

What You'll Do...


Work closely with LCT leadership team, empowering them to make data-driven decision to accelerate the uptake of low carbon technologies
Embed the use of data within the organisation across all levels - making dashboards impactful, engaging and accessible
Improve the efficiency of the LCT organisation - analysing the factors influencing the utilisation of engineers and conversion of sales
Communicate findings and recommendations to senior management and stakeholders



What You'll Need...


Ideally 4+ years of professional experience
Adept at problem solving and communicating answers to business partners
Managed relationships with senior stakeholders and management
Passionate about working in energy and contributing to the energy transition
Curious and self-driven - when faced with a new problem is capable of seeking out an answer without lots of help and support
Highly data literate and numerate - can make sense of lots of data and shape it into a coherent story
Has great attention to detail
Communicates complex ideas clearly



Experience with some of the below technologies:


A scripting language (ideally Python with pandas)
Wrangling data outside of a spreadsheet environment
Writing performant queries in SQL / dbt
Building reports and dashboards in a BI tool (ideally Tableau or Streamlit)
Is passionate about building robust and useable tools



You must...


Be comfortable working with some ambiguity: The LCT team is busy scaling and as such specific responsibilities, projects and focus will evolve over time
Be curious and self driven - it’s essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
Be highly data literate and numerate - can make sense of lots of data and shape it into a coherent structure
Be a problem solver - you’ll need to be able to listen and understand the problems and requirements of the business and come up with pragmatic data solutions



If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!

Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.

You will be working directly with the senior stakeholders in the firm to understand what insights they are looking to gain, then build reports and dashboards using SQL and PowerBI.




Alongside this, you’ll spend the other half of your time analysing the ESG data and markets, looking for ways you can influence and impact the firm’s performance.




This is a relatively junior role, so while you may have some experience with PowerBI, Tableau or SSRS, this is an opportunity to develop those skills further and progress into a Senior position over the next few years.




The Investment Manager has roughly $110 billion AUM and has been identified as one of the fastest growing globally over the last year – which will provide even more opportunities for progression within the role.

About You (Who You Are)


3-4 years of data analyst experience - ideally where you created & managed various dashboards in a consumer start-up

Data modelling & ETL pooling experience - have experience loading and transforming new data sources into table formats that can be easily queried to create high value metrics that align with business outcomes
Ambiguity & a fast-paced environment excites you - your curiosity drives you to ask ‘why?’ to get to the next level of understanding; and you can work at speed
You see more than the data - you have strong business / commercial acumen, and get to the ‘so what’ based on the analysis you do. You help shape the right analysis for the decision at hand
Attention to detail - you have a high bar for ‘correct’, and work through nuances in the data to surface when an insight can be relied on and when it can’t

You proactively identify patterns, risks, and opportunities to build scalable, data-driven solutions
You're curious about how things work and how you can improve them

You're structured and like organisation
You've an excellent work ethic and can manage workloads well
You are able to work effectively within a remote team, it can have its challenges



To be successful in this role, your values matter just as much as skills. Does this sound like you? ✨

🟢We are Kind and Empathetic = Our behaviour and words assume the best in people

🟢We are Always A Team = We are bound together by accountability

🟢We are Curious = A bunch from various backgrounds. We ask questions, plan things out, push the boundaries, challenge the status quo and welcome creativity

🟢We Take Ownership & Deliver = We are focused on our goals and love the details

✅Why work for Vable?


You want ownership of the Data Analytics within Vable
We have a culture that we protect, we value the contributions each Vabler makes
We encourage constant learning so you can keep up to date. A yearly budget of £250 is made available to each Vable employee for continuous learning and development
We encourage creativity and like new ideas and concentrate on the Cultural Add, not fit
We provide comprehensive healthcare cover following probation
You receive a MacBook, monitor and other required technical equipment when you join
33 days of paid leave a year inclusive of statutory holidays, based on where you live
Access to an Employee Assistance Programme through Oliva
We like our virtual socials and really do like to get to know everyone in the team
We are well established; we have been around for 20 years


❌Why it may not be for you:


We are a 40 hour week, Mon-Fri and have core hours, unless stated otherwise or agreed. Being a small remote team, it's how we operate
We have set norms and behaviours and each Vabler is expected to live up to these
While your primary focus will be on data analytics, you'll collaborate with various departments, addressing diverse needs and functions while adapting to shifting priorities. If you prefer a narrowly defined role, this may not be the right fit
We have various meetings per week and people are expected to attend and contribute
Our roles are quite generalist and you will be expected to do areas that you perhaps don't like or feel is not your job. No Vabler has this attitude and we get stuck in and pull our sleeves up. If this isn't you, best not apply.
Everyone has the opportunity to query, ask questions, have new ideas and we will give you our opinion. We operate on continuous feedback and recognition. This isn't for everyone and if this makes you uncomfortable or it's not your thing, this may not be the right fit
We are very transparent and all work is stored on shared drives. Colleagues will give input and it's expected that you will actively adhere to this approach



Interview Process 💌


Intro Call: You will meet a member of the People team for an initial discussion about your background, motivations and experience
Interview: If after the intro call, we're excited to proceed, you will be invited to a second stage interview with the Head of Product & Technology and another applicable manager. This stage will involve a task
Final Interview: Will be with the Head of Product & Technology

Octopus Energy UK 🇬🇧 – Data /

Full-time /

Hybrid



At Octopus, we’ve led the way in innovating new ways to price energy to give customers more control over their energy costs, stamp out the loyalty penalty seen in much of the industry and engage customers to use energy when it is greenest and cheapest. We’re looking for a smart, passionate analyst to join the pricing and commercial function within our data team to help us manage and develop our energy products, and understand customer choices.

Our team takes a technology- and data-driven approach to managing our complex pricing portfolio and sales channels. We apply modern open data and analytics tools like Python, Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks to build pricing tools and customer behaviour models. We’re passionate about automating workloads and processes so we can concentrate on the interesting problems. We’re looking for someone who is equally motivated by using technology to solve problems.

This is a fantastic opportunity to work on problems that genuinely move us closer to Net Zero with a company that is passionate about building great technology and products that change the way customers use energy.

A little heads-up: With some of our team taking some well-deserved annual leave over the next couple of weeks, we may not get around to carefully reviewing all applications until the new year. Every application gets reviewed by a real human, and we’ll be in touch to let you know either way—whether it’s a yes or, sadly, a no this time round. Thanks for your patience and understanding!

What You'll Do...


Produce regular reports and deliver insight into sales and losses, across our different sales channels
Perform competitor and market analysis
Analyse customer switching behaviour and influences (internal e.g. tariff choice or contract renewals; and external e.g. competitor pricing or house moves)
Support operational reporting to monitor and improve growth across our acquisition channels (e.g. commissions reporting, sales incentive performance)
Execute and optimise tariff reprices according to our pricing principles
Build tools and pricing dashboards to visualise product offerings and report margins
Work closely with a broad range of teams including Cost, Procurement, Strategy, Sales and Marketing teams
Provide regulatory and policy support on switching and pricing



What You'll Need...


We don’t need prior energy supplier experience (we can teach that), although experience working in energy retail is a bonus.
Ideally 2 years of professional experience
To be passionate about working in energy and contributing to the energy transition
To be curious and self-driven - when faced with a new problem is capable of seeking out an answer without lots of help and support
To be highly data literate and numerate - can make sense of lots of data and shape it into a coherent story
To have great attention to detail
To communicate complex ideas clearly



You will also need to have experience with some of the below technologies:


A scripting language (ideally Python with pandas)
Wrangling data outside of a spreadsheet environment
Writing performant queries in SQL / dbt
Building reports and dashboards in a BI tool (ideally Tableau or Streamlit)
To be passionate about building robust and useable tools



If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!

Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.

Sharegain began with one question: If the largest institutions solely exercise the right to lend their stocks, bonds, and ETFs, what would it take to unlock this revenue opportunity for every investor?




Our team of experts in the UK, US and Israel built the solution: a platform that empowers online brokers, private banks, and wealth managers to offer securities lending to their clients. We call it SLaaS: Securities Lending as a Service. It’s a fully digital, customizable, end-to-end solution that automates front- and back-office operations. Institutions and investors are now free to earn more from what they own.




Every Sharegainer has their own backstory, but we all share an ambition to do things differently – bigger, better, and greater. Together we’re on a mission to democratize capital markets by building a more liquid world. The more we share, the more we all gain.

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that values diversity and emphasises personal well-being.

MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

YOUR ROLE

Your experience with web and social analytics tools (GA / Adobe / Brandwatch / Sprinklr) and data visualisation tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker / etc) will enable you to uncover key insights across channels and create self-service dashboards.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

Carwow Group is driven by a passion for getting people into cars. But not just any car, the right car. That's why we are building the go-to destination for car-changing. Designed to reach drivers everywhere with our trail-blazing portfolio of personality rich automotive brands; Carwow, Auto Express, evo, Driving Electric and Car Buyer.

What started as a simple reviews site, is now one of the largest online car-changing destinations in Europe - over 10m customers have used Carwow to help them buy and sell cars since its inception. Last year we grew over 50% with nearly £3bn worth of cars bought on site, while £1.8bn of cars were listed for sale through our Sell My Car service.

In 2024 we went big and acquired Autovia, doubling our audience overnight. Together we now have one of the biggest YouTube channels in the world with over 1.1 billion annual views, sell 1.2 million print copies of our magazines and have an annual web content reach over 350million.

WHY JOIN US?

We are winners of the prestigious Culture 100 award that recognises the most loved and happiest tech companies to work for! We have just raised $52m in funding led by global venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners (an early backer of LinkedIn and Shopify) to accelerate our growth plans!

As pioneers, we're always driving for new territory and positive change, so our work as a group is never done. Where others see difficulty, it's our responsibility to see possibility - building new experiences, launching new titles and listening to drivers.

Being a part of Carwow Group means championing drivers and the automotive industry, acting as a disrupter and never being afraid to fail (but learning fast when we do!).

Our team of 500 employees across the UK, Germany, Spain and Portugal are revolutionising car-changing and we are fast expanding our mission across every single brand and country we operate in, so jump in!

Duration: 6 months with possible extension

Pay rate: negotiable (PAYE or Umbrella - Inside IR35)

Work type: remote, with occasional visit to the Leavesden studio




Who are the GO-Tech team?

GO-Tech (Global Operations Technologies) are part of the company's Technology group and are responsible for the software and hardware solutions which run physical operations, globally. Their area of focus encompasses four main pillars:

Tours & Retail
Studio Operations
Physical Security
Global Real Estate




This role sits within the Physical Security pillar, which supports the security systems including Access Control, CCTV, and Threat Monitoring, throughout locations worldwide.




The Role

The Data Analyst will play a key role in the success of a major global project currently in-flight. The primary objective of this position is to analyse, understand, and devise a method for matching our core employee master data with employee data spread across multiple diverse data sources.




As this data will be imported into a new system, it’s imperative that we have a single unique record for each employee in the database, but the unstructured and diverse nature of the data sources mean this will be a complex and challenging activity.




This is a hands-on role and will require somebody with a strong appreciation of databases, scripting, and/or macros to automate as much as possible of the data mapping activity. There will also be a significant manual element to this activity, which will require careful judgement and attention to detail while working through large data sets.




This a great opportunity to provide substantial value to a highly visible project.




Key Responsibilities

Take ownership of the datasets.
Devise methods for matching on suitable attributes.
Update the source data sets with unique employee IDs for every employee.
Document and share your findings with other team members, including appropriate external vendors.
Proactively highlight issues and concerns to the project team.
Collaborate with application and database teams to prepare the source datasets.
Provide regular status updates, including progress reports, identified risks, issues and concerns.




About You

As a Data Analyst, you will be passionate about your work and problem solving, with a motivation to deliver results quickly and effectively.
Proven prior experience in successfully analysing and manipulating large data sets.
Knowledge of SQL, Excel Macros, and other scripting tools.
Passionate about your work and problem solving, flexible, resilient, driven and committed. Exhibiting a strong team orientation, with an innately proactive and not reactive approach to work.
Highly self-motivated, reliable & able to work with limited supervision.




We are committed to creating both a workforce and content that are as diverse as the global audiences we serve. See what we are doing for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging: https://www.warnermediagroup.com/diversity

Sharegain began with one question: If the largest institutions solely exercise the right to lend their stocks, bonds, and ETFs, what would it take to unlock this revenue opportunity for every investor?




Our team of experts in the UK, US and Israel built the solution: a platform that empowers online brokers, private banks, and wealth managers to offer securities lending to their clients. We call it SLaaS: Securities Lending as a Service. It’s a fully digital, customizable, end-to-end solution that automates front- and back-office operations. Institutions and investors are now free to earn more from what they own.




Every Sharegainer has their own backstory, but we all share an ambition to do things differently – bigger, better, and greater. Together we’re on a mission to democratize capital markets by building a more liquid world. The more we share, the more we all gain.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We enable hospitals to focus on what matters most: patient care. Our innovative solutions harness the power of machine learning, generative AI, and behavioral science to deliver exceptional outcomes and empower care teams to anticipate and resolve issues before they arise.

Our success in rapid scale across the globe is backed by some of the world's leading investors. At Qventus, you will have the opportunity to work with an exceptional, mission-driven team across the globe, and the ability to directly impact the lives of patients.

As a Data Analyst you will use your skills in SQL and data visualization to help build and maintain impactful analytics products for both our clients and internal teams. You’ll work closely with our product, design, and engineering teams to illuminate both the operational opportunities in our client hospitals as well as the entire impact chain of our product. By building a deep understanding of what Qventus does and how it improves the delivery of healthcare for our customers, you’ll evaluate the best ways to measure and visualize the performance of our company’s tools and algorithms.

The most important thing to the role will be your ability to balance speed with reliability. It will require your:


Strong SQL skills and comfort working with complex, interrelated datasets
Familiarity with visualization tools. We use Looker, but experience with Tableau, PowerBI, R Shiny, MatPlotLib, or any other similar tool or library is sufficient.
Ability to trace data anomalies from dashboards back to the precipitating log events
Constant curiosity about the problems to be solved (not just the technical execution)



Key Responsibilities:


Support repeatable analyses that drive insights into how our products are being used and how they affect our healthcare customers’ goals
Deliver ad-hoc analyses to support our Delivery team and client satisfaction
Support our analytics products, including troubleshooting queries, supporting dashboard rollouts to new clients, and developing new analytic features
Contribute to the health of our analytics platform (e.g. deployments and documentation)



What We’re Looking For:


3+ years experience in a data-centric role (analytics, science, engineering)
Significant experience leveraging SQL to answer applied business analytics questions
Some experience using modern data visualization tools (Looker preferred)
A love for the big picture and a healthy obsession with the details
Deep curiosity and a passion for real-world impact
High proficiency in spoken and written English



It’s a Plus if You Have…


Experience with US Healthcare data: EHRs and/or claims
Experience with dbt
Experience with data modeling and proper schema design
Working, hands on, knowledge of modern data warehouses (Snowflake preferred)
Experience with Looker and comfort with LookML
Advanced degree in statistics, economics, or other quantitative field
Knowledge of Surgery Operations or Inpatient Flow through hospital settings



We believe that diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are fundamental to improving healthcare and society, and that’s why we’re building a company that leads the way. We hold ourselves accountable to using fair hiring processes that mitigate the negative impacts of unconscious bias. We also work to ensure that people from underrepresented groups play meaningful roles on both sides of the interview table. We are an equal opportunity employer and give all qualified applicants consideration for employment without regard to age, ancestry, color, family or medical care leave, gender identity or expression, genetic information, marital status, medical condition, national origin, physical or mental disability, political affiliation, protected veteran status, race, religion, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by applicable laws, regulations and ordinances.

Candidate information will be treated in accordance with our candidate privacy notice which can be found here: https://qventus.com/ccpa-privacy-notice/

Our Capital One DA Team.

Data is at the center of everything we do. It started in 1988, when we launched as a startup with the goal of using data to deliver personalized credit card products. Fast-forward a few years — we’re a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Data Analyst on our team, you’ll be curious enough to ask questions and brave enough to blurt out a cool idea. You approach problems with creativity, and you love exploring new ways of doing things. But most importantly, you enjoy collaborating, and you’re always willing to share your knowledge with your peers — because you know that’s how the best ideas are made.

Working with us

How do we do things at Capital One Canada? We listen — to our people, and to our customers. We change with the times and have adopted a flexible hybrid model. A flexible hybrid working model is one that creates the opportunity to match the work that we do to the environment that best supports that work. Associates working in the hybrid model are expected to come into the office 3 days a week across Tuesdays and Thursdays, reserving Mondays and Fridays as company-wide virtual days. As was true before the pandemic, expectations of being in the office will be balanced with personal life flexibility.

At Capital One we’re committed to diversity, inclusion and belonging . We strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and inclusive behaviours are embedded in everything we do to positively impact associates. Strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and to help challenge the status quo and create the best outcomes for everyone.

We’re focused on helping associates live well—physically, financially and emotionally. When you join us, we support you and those who are most important to you, offering full coverage for spouses, domestic partners, and dependents. We’ve designed our benefits program to be flexible, comprehensive and consistent across our organization. From health and fitness center discounts, to training and professional development programs—and much more—you’ll discover that Capital One is committed to helping you live your best life.

Here are some examples of projects that you may work on as a Senior Data Analyst:


Build, automate, and maintain critical business reporting using cutting-edge tools.
Write SQL to clean, transform, investigate, and augment large, complex database tables
Work closely with business partners to make sure our business strategy is as data driven as possible
Design and implement rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas to customers or company leaders
Ensure data and intent integrity by automating data quality verification
Support and consult with the business to propagate data management best practices
Create and maintain well-managed critical data processes to meet regulatory requirements.
Identify process improvements and deliver on them.
Perform ad hoc analytics on large/diverse datasets.


We want you to be one of us if you are:


Curious: You ask why, you explore, and you’re not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You know SQL and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.
A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database or an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, QuickSight, Tableau, etc.).
Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.
Collaborative: You’re able to work with teammates with diverse skill sets and explain your work to less technical audiences.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.
