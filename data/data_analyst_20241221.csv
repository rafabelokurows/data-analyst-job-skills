About TikTok U.S. Data Security

TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. U.S. Data Security (“USDS”) is a subsidiary of TikTok in the U.S. This new, security-first division was created to bring heightened focus and governance to our data protection policies and content assurance protocols to keep U.S. users safe. Our focus is on providing oversight and protection of the TikTok platform and U.S. user data, so millions of Americans can continue turning to TikTok to learn something new, earn a living, express themselves creatively, or be entertained. The teams within USDS that deliver on this commitment daily span across Trust & Safety, Security & Privacy, Engineering, User & Product Ops, Corporate Functions and more.

Why Join Us

Creation is the core of TikTok's purpose. Our platform is built to help imaginations thrive. This is doubly true of the teams that make TikTok possible.

Together, we inspire creativity and bring joy - a mission we all believe in and aim towards achieving every day.

To us, every challenge, no matter how difficult, is an opportunity; to learn, to innovate, and to grow as one team. Status quo? Never. Courage? Always.

At TikTok, we create together and grow together. That's how we drive impact - for ourselves, our company, and the communities we serve.

Join us.

The USDS-Platform and Community Integrity (PaCI) team is missioned to: - Protect U.S. TikTok users, including and beyond content consumers, creators, and advertisers; - Secure platform health and community experience authenticity; - Build infrastructures, platforms, and technologies, as well as to collaborate with many cross-functional teams and stakeholders. The PaCI team works to minimize the damage of inauthentic behaviors on TikTok platforms, covering multiple classical and novel community and business risk areas such as account integrity, engagement authenticity, anti-spam, API abuse, growth fraud, live streaming security and financial safety, etc. In this team, you'll have a unique opportunity to have first-hand exposure to the strategy of the company in key security initiatives, especially in building scalable and robust, intelligent and privacy-safe, secure, and product-friendly systems and solutions. Our challenges are not some regular day-to-day technical puzzles -- You'll be part of a team that's developing novel solutions to first-seen challenges of a non-stop evolution of a phenomenal product eco-system. The work needs to be fast, transferrable, while still down to the ground to make quick and solid differences.

In order to enhance collaboration and cross-functional partnerships, among other things, at this time, our organization follows a hybrid work schedule that requires employees to work in the office 3 days a week, or as directed by their manager/department. We regularly review our hybrid work model, and the specific requirements may change at any time.

Responsibilities

Build rules to recognize, mitigate or prevent risky inauthentic behaviors on TikTok and its extended platforms. Such risks include and are not limited to abusive accounts, fake engagements, spammy redirection, scraping, fraud, etc.

Analyze business, product and security data, uncover evolving attack motion, identify weaknesses and opportunities in risk defense solutions, explore new space from the discoveries.

Quantify risk control effects and trends, collaborate with engineering, modeling, operational and product colleagues, contribute to risk measurement, perception, mitigation and prevention with data stories.

Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications:

Bachelor or degrees above in computer science, statistics, math, internet security or other relevant majors (e.g., finance if applying for financial fraud roles)

Strong analytical skills. Proficiency in statistical analytical tools, such as SQL and Python.

Candidates for this position must be legally authorized to work in the United States. This position is not eligible for visa sponsorship or support.

Preferred Qualifications:

Familiarity with social/content online platform analytics. Bonus given to proficiency in data mining skills e.g. modern machine applications.

Ability to think critically, objectively, rationally. Reason and communicate in result-oriented, data-driven manner. High autonomy.

TikTok is committed to creating an inclusive space where employees are valued for their skills, experiences, and unique perspectives. Our platform connects people from across the globe and so does our workplace. At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. To achieve that goal, we are committed to celebrating our diverse voices and to creating an environment that reflects the many communities we reach. We are passionate about this and hope you are too.

TikTok is committed to providing reasonable accommodations in our recruitment processes for candidates with disabilities, pregnancy, sincerely held religious beliefs or other reasons protected by applicable laws. If you need assistance or a reasonable accommodation, please reach out to us at https://shorturl.at/ktJP6.

This role requires the ability to work with and support systems designed to protect sensitive data and information. As such, this role will be subject to strict national security-related screening.

About TikTok U.S. Data Security

TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. U.S. Data Security (“USDS”) is a subsidiary of TikTok in the U.S. This new, security-first division was created to bring heightened focus and governance to our data protection policies and content assurance protocols to keep U.S. users safe. Our focus is on providing oversight and protection of the TikTok platform and U.S. user data, so millions of Americans can continue turning to TikTok to learn something new, earn a living, express themselves creatively, or be entertained. The teams within USDS that deliver on this commitment daily span across Trust & Safety, Security & Privacy, Engineering, User & Product Ops, Corporate Functions and more.

Why Join Us

Creation is the core of TikTok's purpose. Our platform is built to help imaginations thrive. This is doubly true of the teams that make TikTok possible.

Together, we inspire creativity and bring joy - a mission we all believe in and aim towards achieving every day.

To us, every challenge, no matter how difficult, is an opportunity; to learn, to innovate, and to grow as one team. Status quo? Never. Courage? Always.

At TikTok, we create together and grow together. That's how we drive impact - for ourselves, our company, and the communities we serve.

Join us.

The USDS-Platform and Community Integrity (PaCI) team is missioned to: - Protect U.S. TikTok users, including and beyond content consumers, creators, and advertisers; - Secure platform health and community experience authenticity; - Build infrastructures, platforms, and technologies, as well as to collaborate with many cross-functional teams and stakeholders. The PaCI team works to minimize the damage of inauthentic behaviors on TikTok platforms, covering multiple classical and novel community and business risk areas such as account integrity, engagement authenticity, anti-spam, API abuse, growth fraud, live streaming security and financial safety, etc. In this team, you'll have a unique opportunity to have first-hand exposure to the strategy of the company in key security initiatives, especially in building scalable and robust, intelligent and privacy-safe, secure, and product-friendly systems and solutions. Our challenges are not some regular day-to-day technical puzzles -- You'll be part of a team that's developing novel solutions to first-seen challenges of a non-stop evolution of a phenomenal product eco-system. The work needs to be fast, transferrable, while still down to the ground to make quick and solid differences.

In order to enhance collaboration and cross-functional partnerships, among other things, at this time, our organization follows a hybrid work schedule that requires employees to work in the office 3 days a week, or as directed by their manager/department. We regularly review our hybrid work model, and the specific requirements may change at any time.

Responsibilities

Build rules to recognize, mitigate or prevent risky inauthentic behaviors on TikTok and its extended platforms. Such risks include and are not limited to abusive accounts, fake engagements, spammy redirection, scraping, fraud, etc.

Analyze business, product and security data, uncover evolving attack motion, identify weaknesses and opportunities in risk defense solutions, explore new space from the discoveries.

Quantify risk control effects and trends, collaborate with engineering, modeling, operational and product colleagues, contribute to risk measurement, perception, mitigation and prevention with data stories.

Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications:

Bachelor or degrees above in computer science, statistics, math, internet security or other relevant majors (e.g., finance if applying for financial fraud roles)

Strong analytical skills. Proficiency in statistical analytical tools, such as SQL and Python.

Preferred Qualifications:

Familiarity with social/content online platform analytics. Bonus given to proficiency in data mining skills e.g. modern machine applications.

Ability to think critically, objectively, rationally. Reason and communicate in result-oriented, data-driven manner. High autonomy.

Candidates for this position must be legally authorized to work in the United States. This position is not eligible for visa sponsorship or support.

TikTok is committed to creating an inclusive space where employees are valued for their skills, experiences, and unique perspectives. Our platform connects people from across the globe and so does our workplace. At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. To achieve that goal, we are committed to celebrating our diverse voices and to creating an environment that reflects the many communities we reach. We are passionate about this and hope you are too.

TikTok is committed to providing reasonable accommodations in our recruitment processes for candidates with disabilities, pregnancy, sincerely held religious beliefs or other reasons protected by applicable laws. If you need assistance or a reasonable accommodation, please reach out to us at https://shorturl.at/ktJP6.

Leveraging adaptive AI and audio intelligence, it delivers smarter, safer, and more productive voice interactions across networks, apps, and devices. Our network & solution partners have grown to include British Telecom, EE, Virgin Media O2, Ericsson, Rogers, Bell Canada, MasMovil, Telenor, HP, KPMG, and more.

About The Position

The Senior Data Analyst is an individual contributor position responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to both improve and demonstrate the performance of Hiya’s security and protection products. This individual drives improvement both at the high level, with project management duties related to the flow and processing of data, but also at a low level creating high quality robust dashboards. As a Senior Data Analyst you will strive to become a subject matter expert in the products you are working on and potentially participate in customer meetings.

The ideal candidate will be comfortable with some project management duties related to data. This may include things like sourcing data, managing competitive tests, and collecting dashboard requirements from other teams.

This employee works with a team of product managers, solutions architects, scientists, engineers and other analysts whose mission is to provide the best system for identifying spam and fraud activity on telecom networks across the globe.

We’re excited about you because you’re the kind of person that thinks at a systems level. When you have a task before you, you seek to understand the conditions that led to it as you design your solution. You are organized and able to push to completion activities and involve not only your individual activities but also external data vendors and processors. You’re a lifelong learner and a mentor, equally happy to learn from your colleagues as you are to share knowledge with them.

You have a special skill in using data in order to tell a story to others, either externally or within the company. You reach beyond the charts and numbers to understand the real implications of what you find. You’re able to be guided by your analysis to find valuable new threads to pursue, either to get a more complete picture or to find unique perspectives in the research. And once fully pursued, you can use this knowledge to tell the story to others, building a simple and non-technical narrative to explain what you’ve found.

What You’ll Do


Manage and maintain pipelines and processes of data within Hiya, from sourcing to ingestion to analysis
Regularly work with BD, Sales, and Marketing to help them find stories within our data that furthers their own objectives
Frequently work with the Data Science team to explore new theories about voice call traffic worldwide
Develop and maintain production-quality dashboards able to be used internally and externally as tools to assist others in their own analyses
Conduct various tests on service performance, and write documentation to summarize those results


Qualities That Will Make You Successful


Excellent communication skills and the ability to simplify complex concepts
Strong SQL analytical skills
Familiarity with python / R or equivalent for automation
Strong experience with BI platforms including Sigma, and Tableau
Familiarity with big data analytics systems like Databricks
Familiarity with workflow management systems like Airflow
Well-practiced ability to timebox your own work; you intuitively know which threads to pursue, and how far to pursue them in your research
Self-driven curiosity to understand the data (and the implications behind it)


The person in this role must embody Hiya’s key values of Serving our customers, Doing rather than observing, Improving ourselves and our business, Owning and holding ourselves accountable for success, and Leading by showing up with a point of view, engaging in open discussion, listening respectfully to others opinions and committing to decisions.

You will have a fast start if you have experience:


Working in AWS Databricks workbooks and building dashboards
Developing advanced SQL queries including window functions
Optimizing queries for efficient performance in millions or even billions of records
Writing one-pagers and executive summaries based on your research


The requirements listed in the job descriptions are guidelines. You don’t have to satisfy every requirement or meet every qualification listed. If your skills are transferable we would still love to hear from you.

TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. U.S. Data Security (“USDS”) is a subsidiary of TikTok in the U.S. This new, security-first division was created to bring heightened focus and governance to our data protection policies and content assurance protocols to keep U.S. users safe. Our focus is on providing oversight and protection of the TikTok platform and U.S. user data, so millions of Americans can continue turning to TikTok to learn something new, earn a living, express themselves creatively, or be entertained. The teams within USDS that deliver on this commitment daily span across Trust & Safety, Security & Privacy, Engineering, User & Product Ops, Corporate Functions and more.

Why Join Us

Creation is the core of TikTok's purpose. Our platform is built to help imaginations thrive. This is doubly true of the teams that make TikTok possible.

Together, we inspire creativity and bring joy - a mission we all believe in and aim towards achieving every day.

To us, every challenge, no matter how difficult, is an opportunity; to learn, to innovate, and to grow as one team. Status quo? Never. Courage? Always.

At TikTok, we create together and grow together. That's how we drive impact - for ourselves, our company, and the communities we serve.

Join us.

The USDS-Platform and Community Integrity (PaCI) team is missioned to: - Protect U.S. TikTok users, including and beyond content consumers, creators, and advertisers; - Secure platform health and community experience authenticity; - Build infrastructures, platforms, and technologies, as well as to collaborate with many cross-functional teams and stakeholders. The PaCI team works to minimize the damage of inauthentic behaviors on TikTok platforms, covering multiple classical and novel community and business risk areas such as account integrity, engagement authenticity, anti-spam, API abuse, growth fraud, live streaming security and financial safety, etc. In this team, you'll have a unique opportunity to have first-hand exposure to the strategy of the company in key security initiatives, especially in building scalable and robust, intelligent and privacy-safe, secure, and product-friendly systems and solutions. Our challenges are not some regular day-to-day technical puzzles -- You'll be part of a team that's developing novel solutions to first-seen challenges of a non-stop evolution of a phenomenal product eco-system. The work needs to be fast, transferrable, while still down to the ground to make quick and solid differences.

In order to enhance collaboration and cross-functional partnerships, among other things, at this time, our organization follows a hybrid work schedule that requires employees to work in the office 3 days a week, or as directed by their manager/department. We regularly review our hybrid work model, and the specific requirements may change at any time.

Responsibilities

Build rules to recognize, mitigate or prevent risky inauthentic behaviors on TikTok and its extended platforms. Such risks include and are not limited to abusive accounts, fake engagements, spammy redirection, scraping, fraud, etc.

Analyze business, product and security data, uncover evolving attack motion, identify weaknesses and opportunities in risk defense solutions, explore new space from the discoveries.

Quantify risk control effects and trends, collaborate with engineering, modeling, operational and product colleagues, contribute to risk measurement, perception, mitigation and prevention with data stories.

Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications:

Bachelor or degrees above in computer science, statistics, math, internet security or other relevant majors (e.g., finance if applying for financial fraud roles)

Strong analytical skills. Proficiency in statistical analytical tools, such as SQL and Python.

Preferred Qualifications:

Familiarity with social/content online platform analytics. Bonus given to proficiency in data mining skills e.g. modern machine applications.

Ability to think critically, objectively, rationally. Reason and communicate in result-oriented, data-driven manner. High autonomy.

Candidates for this position must be legally authorized to work in the United States. This position is not eligible for visa sponsorship or support.

TikTok is committed to creating an inclusive space where employees are valued for their skills, experiences, and unique perspectives. Our platform connects people from across the globe and so does our workplace. At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. To achieve that goal, we are committed to celebrating our diverse voices and to creating an environment that reflects the many communities we reach. We are passionate about this and hope you are too.

If you need assistance or a reasonable accommodation, please reach out to us at https://shorturl.at/ktJP6.

As a data specialist you will be supporting the entire Personalization area . While the topic is not new, the way we’ve organized it is. Previously we’ve focused the efforts in our department on Product Recommendations and Content Recommendations.
With the addition of several teams from elsewhere in the organization, we’ve added new functionalities to our scope.
The teams that were added provide us with customer-specific details by means of an API, have built several models to help us re-organize the layout of entire pages on Client based on historical behavior and customer details, and provide a sophisticated framework to do nudging and lotteries on client using very specific targeting and trigger details.
In this new set-up we’re looking for someone that can help us bridge the gap between teams.
Strategic: help leadership shape a strategy on how we would like to move forward with Personalization . What are the things the industry is doing; what are the things is doing today; and how can we grow further in this space with our values at heart.
Organizational: the teams in the area should be able to derive new value from working together. Firstly, you will understand yourself what it is they do, identify overlaps and uniqueness, and help them get to know each other better and identify opportunities for further growth or to learn in collaboration.
Operational: the potential of personalization is immense, even more so when you understand that the majority of our sales still happen in-store. It makes quantification of the potential that personalization has for particularly difficult. We are keen to get to know your ideas and thoughts on this and we hope you can help us make a better estimate of this going forward.




Requirements:




Must: analytical skills, SQL, good stakeholder management, thinking on a more strategic level, certain extent of knowledge or experience when it comes to personalization (e.g. recommender systems, clustering / segmentation, modelling techniques for prediction).
Nice: experience with GCP, Big Query, Python (Notebooks), familiar in an FMCG of retail sector, eager to learn, familiar in an eCommerce environment, experience building more strategic plans, experience with building business cases or assessing potential monetary gains on a complex topic.
Analytical skills, thinking on a more strategic level, certain extent of knowledge when it comes to personalization.

La Direction BtoC a pour ambition de développer la plateforme de streaming gratuite leader sur le divertissement familial et l’information pour les francophones.

Cette nouvelle ambition, stratégique pour le Groupe, implique de passer sur l’ensemble des sujets d’un service de rattrapage à une plateforme de streaming / destination. Notre offre est amenée à profondément évoluer que ce soit le produit, l’infrastructure tech, le marketing digital (acquisition et engagement des utilisateurs dans tous les environnements OTT, FAI, TV connectées), le marketing éditorial, les formats publicitaires ainsi que notre organisation et les profils de l’équipe.

Sur le plan digital, TF1+ s’établit comme leader en couverture avec 33 millions de streamers mensuels en moyenne au premier trimestre, et 35,4 millions en mai, un nouveau record, en comparaison des 28 millions de streamers mensuels pour MYTF1 en 2023. Au premier trimestre 2024, la plateforme enregistre 285 millions d’heures streamées (+13% par rapport au premier trimestre 2023) selon Médiamétrie, qui intègre les environnements où subsiste MYTF1, tant que TF1+ n’y est pas encore distribué. Sur les environnements où la nouvelle plateforme est disponible, la consommation est en forte progression de 79%.

Nous recherchons un Data Analyst Growth et Monétisation en CDI pour intervenir sur les sujets liés à l’enrichissement du catalogue de la plateforme de streaming TF1+

C’est prendre part à des projets ambitieux au cœur de la roadmap stratégique du premier groupe audiovisuel privé, leader de la télévision en France avec 5 chaines gratuites et 3 chaines thématiques sur la télévision payante (TF1, TMC, TMX, TF1 SERIES FILMS, LCI, TV BREIZH, HISTOIRE, USHUAIA TV), ainsi que des services de médias audiovisuels à la demande (TF1+, TFOU MAX…) pour en faire la destination de référence pour le divertissement et l’info en France.




C’est faire partie d’un Groupe de l'événement, des émotions et du direct. TF1 propose une programmation diverse et familiale dans les domaines de l’information, du divertissement, de la fiction, du cinéma et des documentaires.




C’est également travailler à la production et la distribution de contenus, notamment via les filiales du Groupe TF1 PRODUCTION, TF1 FILMS PRODUCTION et NEWEN.




C’est enfin réaliser des projets qui se voient, et qui impactent directement la vie de millions de personnes, au sein d’une entreprise consciente de sa responsabilité sociétale et environnementale. En effet, le groupe TF1 s’engage pour participer à la construction d’une société plus solidaire, plus inclusive et plus durable.




Sur le plan social, le Groupe agit activement en faveur de l’égalité femme-homme, au sein des équipes comme sur les plateaux télévisés. Il promeut également la diversité et l’inclusion dans le recrutement, le management des talents, mais aussi sur l’ensemble de ses chaînes.

Sur le plan environnemental, le Groupe est engagé dans une trajectoire de décarbonation avec des objectifs validés par le SBTi, et tâche de favoriser la publicité responsable, mais aussi de sensibiliser ses publics à la transition écologique, tant au travers de ses programmes d’information que des fictions ou séries quotidiennes.




A la clé




Un environnement de travail et une culture d’entreprise permettant à tous les profils de s’épanouir au quotidien.

Des espaces qui allient confort et praticité

95% des collaborateurs jugent l’aménagement des locaux pleinement satisfaisant 👍 (enquête interne 2022), et 81% pensent que nos espaces en flex-office favorisent une bonne ambiance
Espaces flex, terrasses végétalisées ou télétravail : c’est à la carte.
Sur place ou à emporter : des repas healthy, variés et subventionnés au restaurant d’entreprise ou à la cafétéria, mais aussi le plein de services trop pratiques (parking, atelier réparation vélo, permanence mutuelle, opticien…)

Une culture all-inclusive

56% de femmes dans le Groupe, 30% dans les équipes Tech, et une envie forte d’aller encore plus loin
Une Mission Handicap qui agit chaque jour pour garantir le respect de la singularité de chacun en proposant un accompagnement sur mesure aux collaborateurs concernés par un handicap, ainsi qu’à leur manager !

Training

Pour le corps, grâce à nos 17 associations sportives (football, volleyball, krav maga, running, etc.), et notre salle de sport subventionnée à moins de 100 mètres
Pour l’esprit, avec des formations pour se mettre à jour en permanence (75% des collaborateurs formés en 2023), et un accompagnement de carrière sur-mesure

+1 👶

Le Groupe TF1 propose à l’ensemble des collaborateurs une flexibilité en matière d’organisation du temps de travail avant le congé maternité, et un suivi professionnel au retour
Le salaire est maintenu à 100% pour les collaborateurs concernés par la prise totale ou partielle d’un congé paternité / second parent, et ce, durant 28 jours
Une prise en charge partielle des modes de garde est proposée

Et parce que le nombre de caractères est limité, on sera ravis de vous présenter les différents plans d’épargne entreprise, les congés spéciaux, la mutuelle d’entreprise, les forfaits mobilité ou encore le CSE lors de notre prochain échange !

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have an absolute love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem, and living inside a spreadsheet/data set to find the answer to any question.
Because you love data, you have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis. Experience with Marketing APIs, Big Query or other Cloud Data Warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.), ETL Tools (Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics) and/or Python are all pluses.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and have spent a minimum of 1 year working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.




What You’ll Do:

Reporting: With your expertise in Advanced Excel, SQL, Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools, you’ll be maintaining customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence, generating pivot tables and other visualizations that summarize thousands of lines of data. You should have experience in translating performance media metrics into coherent, digestible reports for client ad campaigns and be comfortable communicating via Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.
Strategy: You’ll be responsible for learning our clients’ businesses and aligning their media strategy with business goals as well as understanding advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to help guide media buying strategy. With a background in paid media and/or digital advertising, you understand concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue and are able to be engaged in discussions with clients to gain trust and shareholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.




Gupta Media is an office-first (with flexibility) organization and we are excited to have our team working together again

We're a high-tech home security company that's passionate about protecting the life you've built and our mission of keeping Every Home Secure. And we've created a culture here that cares just as deeply about the career you're building. Ours is a no ego culture of collaboration and innovation where those seeking their next challenge can find big opportunities and make a huge impact on the lives of all those who we protect. We don't just want you to work here. We want you to grow and thrive here.



We're embracing a hybrid work model that enables our teams to split their time between office and home. Hybrid for us means we expect our teams to come together in our state-of-the-art office on two core days, typically Tuesday and Wednesday, to work together in person, and teams can choose where they work for the remainder of the week. We all benefit from flexibility and get to use the best of both worlds to get our work done.

Why are we hiring?

Well, we're growing and thriving. So, we need smart, talented, and humble people who share our values to join us as we disrupt the home security space and relentlessly pursue our mission of keeping Every Home Secure.

We are …

a team of designers, strategists, engineers, writers, researchers and product folks based in downtown Boston. Over the past ten years, we've quietly transformed home security from an outdated, unfriendly industry to something elegant, thoughtful, and beautifully designed. We put our customers at the center of everything we do. We care deeply about their experience and we constantly try to delight them with innovative products and services that are fairly priced. Our top ratings in the App/Play store are a clear validation of our commitment to customer experience. Plus, CNET, the Wirecutter and PCMag all named us their Editors' Choice for home security.

Excellent communication skills and ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams.
Proficiency in SQL and data visualization tools such as Tableau, Looker, or Power BI.
Strong analytical skills and ability to work with large, complex data sets.
Experience with statistical analysis and experimental design.

One Team - highly collaborative approach to achieving success.
Lift As We Climb - A track record of investing in developing others and helping others succeed.
Lean & Nimble - working with agility and efficiency to experiment in an often-ambiguous environment.

We're a high-tech home security company that's passionate about protecting the life you've built and our mission of keeping Every Home Secure. And we've created a culture here that cares just as deeply about the career you're building. Ours is a no ego culture of collaboration and innovation where those seeking their next challenge can find big opportunities and make a huge impact on the lives of all those who we protect. We don't just want you to work here. We want you to grow and thrive here.



We're embracing a hybrid work model that enables our teams to split their time between office and home. Hybrid for us means we expect our teams to come together in our state-of-the-art office on two core days, typically Tuesday and Wednesday, to work together in person, and teams can choose where they work for the remainder of the week. We all benefit from flexibility and get to use the best of both worlds to get our work done.

Why are we hiring?

Well, we're growing and thriving. So, we need smart, talented, and humble people who share our values to join us as we disrupt the home security space and relentlessly pursue our mission of keeping Every Home Secure.

We are …

a team of designers, strategists, engineers, writers, researchers and product folks based in downtown Boston. Over the past ten years, we've quietly transformed home security from an outdated, unfriendly industry to something elegant, thoughtful, and beautifully designed. We put our customers at the center of everything we do. We care deeply about their experience and we constantly try to delight them with innovative products and services that are fairly priced. Our top ratings in the App/Play store are a clear validation of our commitment to customer experience. Plus, CNET, the Wirecutter and PCMag all named us their Editors' Choice for home security.

Up to 3 years of experience in a data analytics role, with a focus on product analytics.
Excellent communication skills and ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams.
Proficiency in SQL and data visualization tools such as Tableau, Looker, or Power BI.
Strong analytical skills and ability to work with large, complex data sets.
Experience with statistical analysis and experimental design.


What Values You'll Share:

Aim High - Always challenging oneself and others to raise the bar.
No Ego - ""no job too small"" attitude, and open, inclusive and humble style.
One Team - highly collaborative approach to achieving success.
Lift As We Climb - A track record of investing in developing others and helping others succeed.
Lean & Nimble - working with agility and efficiency to experiment in an often-ambiguous environment.
