At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.




We are looking for a Data Analyst that is passionate about metrics and telling the stories behind the data. We have several roles open across different teams (grocery, loyalty, restaurants). Data Analysts at Deliveroo report into our data science management team.




You will be a professional in insights storytelling, communication and visualisation and know how to create action from metrics. Crafting effective intelligent benchmarks, understanding performance, caring about data quality, enabling automation and creating phenomenal visualisations and stories are things that drive you.


What you'll be doing



Work closely with commercial stakeholders to create value and business impact through better data availability, visualisation and analysis


Discover, analyse, and interpret trends or patterns in complex datasets to perform ad-hoc analyses and deliver insights to the executive team and senior management


Understand key drivers of the business and provide data driven guidance on key levers


Identify and specify data needs and quality requirements and work closely with Analytics Engineers to ensure data is available, accurate and corresponds to the business needs


Consolidate and distribute best analytical practices from different teams and countries



Requirements



Experience identifying the root cause of problems, assessing risks/impacts and determining and implementing effective solutions.


A good understanding of querying in SQL and understanding of database structure - you'll be expected to be able to extract the data you need for your analysis.


Compelling story-telling skills, and an eye for powerful visualisations - you'll need to translate your findings for all levels of stakeholder (business and technical)


Good knowledge of Excel/GSheets - depending on the task, there is a good chance that this is where some of your exploratory analysis will take place. Being comfortable with pivot tables and functions will be essential.


Developer experience with a data visualisation tool (Looker, Tableau, Periscope)

Octopus Energy UK 🇬🇧 – Data /

Full-time /

Hybrid



At Octopus, our mission is to decarbonise the energy system as quickly as possible. Households are critical in driving the next phase of decarbonisation, through the way we travel and heat our homes.

The Low Carbon Tech (LCT) team sits inside the Octopus Energy group, where its sole purpose is to drive the uptake of technologies combatting the effects of climate change - including Heat Pumps, Solar panels and EV chargers. The team focuses on the end-to-end customer journey of purchasing, installing and monitoring the technologies.

What does it mean to be part of the LCT data team?

The Octopus data team builds tools, pipelines, analysis and machine learning products across the business - we are organised so that each team or ‘pod’ is embedded within and focused upon a specific domain - the LCT data team is dedicated to the Low Carbon Tech business. The data team work closely with other pods to maintain the different tools we build - it’s a collaborative environment and we encourage everyone in the team

A little heads-up: With some of our team taking some well-deserved annual leave over the next couple of weeks, we may not get around to carefully reviewing all applications until the new year. Every application gets reviewed by a real human, and we’ll be in touch to let you know either way—whether it’s a yes or, sadly, a no this time round. Thanks for your patience and understanding!

What You'll Do...


Work closely with LCT leadership team, empowering them to make data-driven decision to accelerate the uptake of low carbon technologies
Embed the use of data within the organisation across all levels - making dashboards impactful, engaging and accessible
Improve the efficiency of the LCT organisation - analysing the factors influencing the utilisation of engineers and conversion of sales
Communicate findings and recommendations to senior management and stakeholders



What You'll Need...


Ideally 4+ years of professional experience
Adept at problem solving and communicating answers to business partners
Managed relationships with senior stakeholders and management
Passionate about working in energy and contributing to the energy transition
Curious and self-driven - when faced with a new problem is capable of seeking out an answer without lots of help and support
Highly data literate and numerate - can make sense of lots of data and shape it into a coherent story
Has great attention to detail
Communicates complex ideas clearly



Experience with some of the below technologies:


A scripting language (ideally Python with pandas)
Wrangling data outside of a spreadsheet environment
Writing performant queries in SQL / dbt
Building reports and dashboards in a BI tool (ideally Tableau or Streamlit)
Is passionate about building robust and useable tools



You must...


Be comfortable working with some ambiguity: The LCT team is busy scaling and as such specific responsibilities, projects and focus will evolve over time
Be curious and self driven - it’s essential you have the initiative to make decisions yourself, and can find solutions to novel problems without lots of help and support
Be highly data literate and numerate - can make sense of lots of data and shape it into a coherent structure
Be a problem solver - you’ll need to be able to listen and understand the problems and requirements of the business and come up with pragmatic data solutions



If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!

Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.

You will be working directly with the senior stakeholders in the firm to understand what insights they are looking to gain, then build reports and dashboards using SQL and PowerBI.




Alongside this, you’ll spend the other half of your time analysing the ESG data and markets, looking for ways you can influence and impact the firm’s performance.




This is a relatively junior role, so while you may have some experience with PowerBI, Tableau or SSRS, this is an opportunity to develop those skills further and progress into a Senior position over the next few years.

… and we’re just getting started! Read more about our mission to change healthcare here.

What’s Next?

You see more than the data - you have strong business / commercial acumen, and get to the ‘so what’ based on the analysis you do. You help shape the right analysis for the decision at hand
Attention to detail - you have a high bar for ‘correct’, and work through nuances in the data to surface when an insight can be relied on and when it can’t

HELPING OUR CLIENTS UNLOCK GROWTH IN THE PLATFORM WORLD

Our clients compete in the platform world, a horizontal marketplace between creators and consumers, between speakers and listeners, between buyers and sellers. To thrive in the platform world, companies must continue to innovate their products and business models. Four imperatives (1. Real Identity, 2. Dynamic, Diverse and Disruptive Creativity 3., Smart Media and 4. Direct Relationships) via our suite of world-class agencies, are necessary for modern brands to win in the platform world. At Publicis Groupe, we’ve invested in capabilities across these four imperatives our clients need to unlock growth. As the only one who can architect, build and orchestrate end to end solutions, not only do we have a proven record of building bespoke models for clients and leading expertise across all major industry categories, we are able to offer our talents more opportunities to grow and benefit from a richer learning experience. We call this Power of One. Powered by a 100,000-strong network via Marcel, our AI-based platform, we are also able to provide our clients and talents instant access to resource, knowledge for any need, any time, in any market.

THE SPIRIT OF VIVA LA DIFFERENCE

Viva La Difference is deeply rooted in everything we do. It has always been in our DNA. From the birth of Publicis, 94 years ago, when Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, our founder, invented French advertising. Viva La Difference expresses how we value and respect each individual and recognize what makes us distinctive. This is the charge that inspires our teams to celebrate the differences in identity, background, culture, and experience of all of us. It is how we behave with each other and our clients, and it is deeply rooted throughout our work, to elevate and bring to life our differences throughout the platform world.

Sylvera provides carbon data for genuine climate impact. Our mission is to incentivize investment in real climate action.

Purchasing credits through the carbon markets is one of the most established and scalable ways to channel finance from the private sector to effective climate solutions and work toward societal net zero. Unfortunately, the voluntary carbon markets have been plagued with mistrust and a lack of effectiveness since they’ve emerged – until Sylvera.

To help organizations ensure they're making the most effective investments, Sylvera builds software that independently and accurately automates the evaluation of carbon projects that capture, remove, or avoid emissions. With Sylvera's data and tools, businesses and governments can confidently invest in, benchmark, deliver, and report real climate impact.

Our team is made up of leading minds in climate change from scientists to policy, finance and carbon market experts. We work in partnership with scientific organisations, universities, governments and think tanks to develop and test rigorous and holistic ratings methodologies, leveraging the latest technology. Founded in 2020, Sylvera has employees worldwide with offices in London, New York, Belgrade and Singapore. We’ve raised over $96million from leading VCs like Balderton Capital, Index Ventures and Insight Partners to date.

Carwow Group is driven by a passion for getting people into cars. But not just any car, the right car. That's why we are building the go-to destination for car-changing. Designed to reach drivers everywhere with our trail-blazing portfolio of personality rich automotive brands; Carwow, Auto Express, evo, Driving Electric and Car Buyer.

What started as a simple reviews site, is now one of the largest online car-changing destinations in Europe - over 10m customers have used Carwow to help them buy and sell cars since its inception. Last year we grew over 50% with nearly £3bn worth of cars bought on site, while £1.8bn of cars were listed for sale through our Sell My Car service.

In 2024 we went big and acquired Autovia, doubling our audience overnight. Together we now have one of the biggest YouTube channels in the world with over 1.1 billion annual views, sell 1.2 million print copies of our magazines and have an annual web content reach over 350million.

WHY JOIN US?

We are winners of the prestigious Culture 100 award that recognises the most loved and happiest tech companies to work for! We have just raised $52m in funding led by global venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners (an early backer of LinkedIn and Shopify) to accelerate our growth plans!

As pioneers, we're always driving for new territory and positive change, so our work as a group is never done. Where others see difficulty, it's our responsibility to see possibility - building new experiences, launching new titles and listening to drivers.

Being a part of Carwow Group means championing drivers and the automotive industry, acting as a disrupter and never being afraid to fail (but learning fast when we do!).

Our team of 500 employees across the UK, Germany, Spain and Portugal are revolutionising car-changing and we are fast expanding our mission across every single brand and country we operate in, so jump in!

Octopus Energy UK 🇬🇧 – Data /

Full-time /

Hybrid



At Octopus, we’ve led the way in innovating new ways to price energy to give customers more control over their energy costs, stamp out the loyalty penalty seen in much of the industry and engage customers to use energy when it is greenest and cheapest. We’re looking for a smart, passionate analyst to join the pricing and commercial function within our data team to help us manage and develop our energy products, and understand customer choices.

Our team takes a technology- and data-driven approach to managing our complex pricing portfolio and sales channels. We apply modern open data and analytics tools like Python, Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks to build pricing tools and customer behaviour models. We’re passionate about automating workloads and processes so we can concentrate on the interesting problems. We’re looking for someone who is equally motivated by using technology to solve problems.

This is a fantastic opportunity to work on problems that genuinely move us closer to Net Zero with a company that is passionate about building great technology and products that change the way customers use energy.

A little heads-up: With some of our team taking some well-deserved annual leave over the next couple of weeks, we may not get around to carefully reviewing all applications until the new year. Every application gets reviewed by a real human, and we’ll be in touch to let you know either way—whether it’s a yes or, sadly, a no this time round. Thanks for your patience and understanding!

What You'll Do...


Produce regular reports and deliver insight into sales and losses, across our different sales channels
Perform competitor and market analysis
Analyse customer switching behaviour and influences (internal e.g. tariff choice or contract renewals; and external e.g. competitor pricing or house moves)
Support operational reporting to monitor and improve growth across our acquisition channels (e.g. commissions reporting, sales incentive performance)
Execute and optimise tariff reprices according to our pricing principles
Build tools and pricing dashboards to visualise product offerings and report margins
Work closely with a broad range of teams including Cost, Procurement, Strategy, Sales and Marketing teams
Provide regulatory and policy support on switching and pricing



What You'll Need...


We don’t need prior energy supplier experience (we can teach that), although experience working in energy retail is a bonus.
Ideally 2 years of professional experience
To be passionate about working in energy and contributing to the energy transition
To be curious and self-driven - when faced with a new problem is capable of seeking out an answer without lots of help and support
To be highly data literate and numerate - can make sense of lots of data and shape it into a coherent story
To have great attention to detail
To communicate complex ideas clearly



You will also need to have experience with some of the below technologies:


A scripting language (ideally Python with pandas)
Wrangling data outside of a spreadsheet environment
Writing performant queries in SQL / dbt
Building reports and dashboards in a BI tool (ideally Tableau or Streamlit)
To be passionate about building robust and useable tools



If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!

Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.

Duration: 6 months with possible extension

Pay rate: negotiable (PAYE or Umbrella - Inside IR35)

Work type: remote, with occasional visit to the Leavesden studio




Who are the GO-Tech team?

GO-Tech (Global Operations Technologies) are part of the company's Technology group and are responsible for the software and hardware solutions which run physical operations, globally. Their area of focus encompasses four main pillars:

Tours & Retail
Studio Operations
Physical Security
Global Real Estate




This role sits within the Physical Security pillar, which supports the security systems including Access Control, CCTV, and Threat Monitoring, throughout locations worldwide.




The Role

The Data Analyst will play a key role in the success of a major global project currently in-flight. The primary objective of this position is to analyse, understand, and devise a method for matching our core employee master data with employee data spread across multiple diverse data sources.




As this data will be imported into a new system, it’s imperative that we have a single unique record for each employee in the database, but the unstructured and diverse nature of the data sources mean this will be a complex and challenging activity.




This is a hands-on role and will require somebody with a strong appreciation of databases, scripting, and/or macros to automate as much as possible of the data mapping activity. There will also be a significant manual element to this activity, which will require careful judgement and attention to detail while working through large data sets.




This a great opportunity to provide substantial value to a highly visible project.




Key Responsibilities

Take ownership of the datasets.
Devise methods for matching on suitable attributes.
Update the source data sets with unique employee IDs for every employee.
Document and share your findings with other team members, including appropriate external vendors.
Proactively highlight issues and concerns to the project team.
Collaborate with application and database teams to prepare the source datasets.
Provide regular status updates, including progress reports, identified risks, issues and concerns.




About You

As a Data Analyst, you will be passionate about your work and problem solving, with a motivation to deliver results quickly and effectively.
Proven prior experience in successfully analysing and manipulating large data sets.
Knowledge of SQL, Excel Macros, and other scripting tools.
Passionate about your work and problem solving, flexible, resilient, driven and committed. Exhibiting a strong team orientation, with an innately proactive and not reactive approach to work.
Highly self-motivated, reliable & able to work with limited supervision.




We are committed to creating both a workforce and content that are as diverse as the global audiences we serve. See what we are doing for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging: https://www.warnermediagroup.com/diversity

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that values diversity and emphasises personal well-being.

MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

Sharegain began with one question: If the largest institutions solely exercise the right to lend their stocks, bonds, and ETFs, what would it take to unlock this revenue opportunity for every investor?




Our team of experts in the UK, US and Israel built the solution: a platform that empowers online brokers, private banks, and wealth managers to offer securities lending to their clients. We call it SLaaS: Securities Lending as a Service. It’s a fully digital, customizable, end-to-end solution that automates front- and back-office operations. Institutions and investors are now free to earn more from what they own.




Every Sharegainer has their own backstory, but we all share an ambition to do things differently – bigger, better, and greater. Together we’re on a mission to democratize capital markets by building a more liquid world. The more we share, the more we all gain.

Octopus Energy UK 🇬🇧 – Data /

Full-time /

Hybrid



At Octopus, we’ve led the way in innovating new ways to price energy to give customers more control over their energy costs, stamp out the loyalty penalty seen in much of the industry and engage customers to use energy when it is greenest and cheapest. We’re looking for a smart, passionate analyst to join the pricing and commercial function within our data team to help us manage and develop our energy products, and understand customer choices.

Our team takes a technology- and data-driven approach to managing our complex pricing portfolio and sales channels. We apply modern open data and analytics tools like Python, Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks to build pricing tools and customer behaviour models. We’re passionate about automating workloads and processes so we can concentrate on the interesting problems. We’re looking for someone who is equally motivated by using technology to solve problems.

This is a fantastic opportunity to work on problems that genuinely move us closer to Net Zero with a company that is passionate about building great technology and products that change the way customers use energy.

A little heads-up: With some of our team taking some well-deserved annual leave over the next couple of weeks, we may not get around to carefully reviewing all applications until the new year. Every application gets reviewed by a real human, and we’ll be in touch to let you know either way—whether it’s a yes or, sadly, a no this time round. Thanks for your patience and understanding!

What You'll Do...


Produce regular reports and deliver insight into sales and losses, across our different sales channels
Perform competitor and market analysis
Analyse customer switching behaviour and influences (internal e.g. tariff choice or contract renewals; and external e.g. competitor pricing or house moves)
Support operational reporting to monitor and improve growth across our acquisition channels (e.g. commissions reporting, sales incentive performance)
Execute and optimise tariff reprices according to our pricing principles
Build tools and pricing dashboards to visualise product offerings and report margins
Work closely with a broad range of teams including Cost, Procurement, Strategy, Sales and Marketing teams
Provide regulatory and policy support on switching and pricing



What You'll Need...


We don’t need prior energy supplier experience (we can teach that), although experience working in energy retail is a bonus.
Ideally 2 years of professional experience
To be passionate about working in energy and contributing to the energy transition
To be curious and self-driven - when faced with a new problem is capable of seeking out an answer without lots of help and support
To be highly data literate and numerate - can make sense of lots of data and shape it into a coherent story
To have great attention to detail
To communicate complex ideas clearly



You will also need to have experience with some of the below technologies:


A scripting language (ideally Python with pandas)
Wrangling data outside of a spreadsheet environment
Writing performant queries in SQL / dbt
Building reports and dashboards in a BI tool (ideally Tableau or Streamlit)
To be passionate about building robust and useable tools



If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!

Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.

Duration: 6 months with possible extension

Pay rate: negotiable (PAYE or Umbrella - Inside IR35)

Work type: remote, with occasional visit to the Leavesden studio




Who are the GO-Tech team?

GO-Tech (Global Operations Technologies) are part of the company's Technology group and are responsible for the software and hardware solutions which run physical operations, globally. Their area of focus encompasses four main pillars:

Tours & Retail
Studio Operations
Physical Security
Global Real Estate




This role sits within the Physical Security pillar, which supports the security systems including Access Control, CCTV, and Threat Monitoring, throughout locations worldwide.




The Role

The Data Analyst will play a key role in the success of a major global project currently in-flight. The primary objective of this position is to analyse, understand, and devise a method for matching our core employee master data with employee data spread across multiple diverse data sources.




As this data will be imported into a new system, it’s imperative that we have a single unique record for each employee in the database, but the unstructured and diverse nature of the data sources mean this will be a complex and challenging activity.




This is a hands-on role and will require somebody with a strong appreciation of databases, scripting, and/or macros to automate as much as possible of the data mapping activity. There will also be a significant manual element to this activity, which will require careful judgement and attention to detail while working through large data sets.




This a great opportunity to provide substantial value to a highly visible project.




Key Responsibilities

Take ownership of the datasets.
Devise methods for matching on suitable attributes.
Update the source data sets with unique employee IDs for every employee.
Document and share your findings with other team members, including appropriate external vendors.
Proactively highlight issues and concerns to the project team.
Collaborate with application and database teams to prepare the source datasets.
Provide regular status updates, including progress reports, identified risks, issues and concerns.




About You

As a Data Analyst, you will be passionate about your work and problem solving, with a motivation to deliver results quickly and effectively.
Proven prior experience in successfully analysing and manipulating large data sets.
Knowledge of SQL, Excel Macros, and other scripting tools.
Passionate about your work and problem solving, flexible, resilient, driven and committed. Exhibiting a strong team orientation, with an innately proactive and not reactive approach to work.
Highly self-motivated, reliable & able to work with limited supervision.

Sharegain began with one question: If the largest institutions solely exercise the right to lend their stocks, bonds, and ETFs, what would it take to unlock this revenue opportunity for every investor?




Our team of experts in the UK, US and Israel built the solution: a platform that empowers online brokers, private banks, and wealth managers to offer securities lending to their clients. We call it SLaaS: Securities Lending as a Service. It’s a fully digital, customizable, end-to-end solution that automates front- and back-office operations. Institutions and investors are now free to earn more from what they own.




Every Sharegainer has their own backstory, but we all share an ambition to do things differently – bigger, better, and greater. Together we’re on a mission to democratize capital markets by building a more liquid world. The more we share, the more we all gain.

Ensure reports are visually compelling and user-friendly, providing key insights at a glance.




SQL Query Writing and Optimization:

Write, optimize, and maintain complex SQL queries to extract, transform, and load data from various sources.
Develop and manage stored procedures, functions, and scripts to automate data processing and reporting tasks.
Perform regular database performance analysis and optimization to ensure efficiency.




Data Analysis and Reporting:

Provide ad-hoc reporting and data analysis based on the requests of stakeholders.




Data Quality and Governance

Ensure the accuracy, consistency, and integrity of data by implementing data validation and quality checks.
Document data processes, report development, and SQL code for future reference and knowledge sharing.




Collaboration

Work closely with cross-functional teams, including product, business units, and leadership, to understand data needs and deliver actionable insights.
Train and support users and team members on using Power BI reports and dashboards.




Required skills

“Can do attitude”
At least 3 years of expertise in Power BI, including DAX and data modelling.
Experience building and maintaining efficient sematic models.
Strong proficiency in SQL, including query optimization and stored procedure development.
Experience with data warehousing and data mart concepts.

Hands-on experience working with Azure Synapse Analytics/Fabric (advantageous).
Understanding and professional experience in financial markets and instruments (shares, ETFs, bonds) (advantageous).
Strong problem-solving and analytical skills, with the ability to interpret data and present insights effectively.

Zero100 is a membership-based intelligence platform that connects, informs, and inspires the world’s most influential C-Level Operations & Supply Chain Officers – and their teams – to unlock the true potential of the AI and Digital Revolution for the lasting benefit of business and our planet. Our members use Zero100’s research and advisory services to shape their supply chain strategies, and they harness the power of our community to expand their thinking, challenge their assumptions, and accelerate progress on their most important digitisation and decarbonisation initiatives.




With a rapidly expanding headquarters in central London, we’re proud to be backed by leading investors and supported by an impressive list of founding members that includes Unilever, Google, The Estee Lauder Companies, and Volvo.




Position Summary

We are seeking a highly motivated Research Data Analyst to support our research analytics endeavours. This unique position offers the opportunity to work closely with both our data and research teams, pushing the boundaries of data exploration on research related to supply chain innovation, digitization, and decarbonization.




Note: This is a primarily office-based role (4 days per week in office and 1 day work from home per week). Candidates must have the right to work in the UK, though Tier 2 visa sponsorship is available for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements.




In this role, your primary focus will be explorative analysis, using strong analytical skills to frame the right questions and delve into data in search of emerging patterns. The data team will support you with data discovery, ingestion, and quality assurance, while you’ll use SQL and Python to self-serve from our internal SQL database, allowing for efficient and autonomous exploration, and follow your own curiosity to pursue new inputs for dataset creation. With the research team, you will write reports and prepare frameworks and deliverables aligned with our research agenda, while reserving a portion of your time to support customer engagements.




Key Responsibilities

Engage in hypothesis-driven explorative analysis to uncover new insights and answer questions around supply chain digitization and decarbonization.
Frame and refine data-focused questions that address strategic industry topics.
Over time, you'll play a role in mentoring junior team members, sharing best practices in hypothesis generation to help them approach data-driven questions with a strategic lens.
Independently query our internal SQL databases allowing you to self-serve and explore data without heavy dependencies on the data team.
Collaborate closely with data team members to identify, ingest, and prepare new datasets relevant to your research.
Conduct primary research on AI and other advanced technology implementations within the supply chain sector.
Visualize and present findings in ways that enhance understanding and support decision-making.
Work with Research Directors to shape insights into member-facing content, including keynotes at our conferences, and strategic reports.




Who you are

You are an experienced research analyst, research manager, or data analyst with a curiosity-driven, critically minded approach to research analytics. With 4-6 years of professional experience in this field, you have solid SQL skills and are adept at both identifying the right questions to ask and creating innovative ways to answer them, including developing proxies and leveraging unconventional data sources. You thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment and are excited by the challenge of uncovering new patterns and insights to drive industry-leading research.




Requirements

Basic proficiency in Python and SQL (BigQuery), with the ability to self-serve analysis queries and modify existing code for more complex and advanced data manipulation - preference given to candidates with more extensive skills.
Strong analytical mindset, with a talent for framing the right questions to drive meaningful explorative analysis.
Ability to visualize data effectively, ideally with experience in PowerBI or similar tools. Excel is a must.
Experience conducting exploratory analysis to derive insights from large, complex datasets.
Exceptional problem-solving skills to tackle multifaceted data questions and identifying new data sources.
Strong communication skills for explaining findings in research reports and discussions with cross-functional teams.
Ability to work both independently on explorative projects and collaboratively within a fast-paced environment.




Preferred Qualifications:

Exposure to data science, LLMs, or machine learning, especially in exploratory contexts.
Experience and/or interest in AI and its applications within supply chain.
Academic background or strong interest in supply chain or similar field.
Experience working with APIs.
Experience working in start-up and/or scale-up environments.

Competitive Salary
Private Healthcare
Enhanced pension/401k
Unlimited vacation policy
