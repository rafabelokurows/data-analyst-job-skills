Our Ways of Working

We have team members located across the United States spanning multiple time zones. This means we put in extra effort to make sure we connect and collaborate in ways that make sense for us. We know how valuable the flexibility of remote work is for our employees.

We know that personal connection is the foundation for the great work we do together. In order to build those relationships with team members in other cities, we meet with coworkers in person two times a year at a full company offsite and a departmental offsite. These offsites are expected of employees and are great opportunities to meet the people you work with every day and to do some of the work that is much more difficult to do virtually.

What the Role Is

We are seeking an experienced and highly analytical Staff Data Analyst to join our Analytics team. In this role, you will collaborate closely with the executive and finance teams to support business strategy, financial planning, and the identification of new strategic opportunities. You will play a key role in delivering actionable insights to drive decision-making and long-term growth.

The power of Babylist is in our product and the long term relationship we have with our users. We are continuing to improve our core user experience while exploring new ways to better support growing families. As a Staff Data Analyst, you will own strategic initiatives end to end, influence decision-making, mentor more junior data scientists and analysts, and lead in solving business problems based on Babylist's evolving strategic outlook.

The ideal candidate will possess a strategic analytics background and the business acumen to own stakeholder relationships with senior executives.

You will report directly to the Director of Analytics.

The estimated pay range for this role is CAD $180,000.00 - $270,000.00
