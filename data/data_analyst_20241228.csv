ThirdLove disrupted the lingerie industry by empowering women to find their perfect fit online with our innovative Fitting Room® quiz and is one of the original brands to operate 100% direct-to-consumer. All design and R&D is done in-house, and our extensive and complex supply chain is fully managed by our team. Inclusivity is at the core of who we are and how we serve our customers and build our teams.

Traditionally, women were given a choice between two options when it came to their bras and underwear: Be sexy, or be comfortable. Our Cofounders: Dave Spector, Heidi Zak, and Ra’el Cohen, thought that was outdated too — so, in 2013, they created ThirdLove — a third, better option, which doesn’t force us to choose between being sexy or comfortable.

What Our Team Embodies

Our culture is collaborative, fast-paced, and data-driven, and we were most recently recognized with the Great Place to Work certification. This recognition is given to a very small percentage of companies who apply for it and determined by employees’ real-time reports of their company culture. Earning this designation demonstrates to us that our team at ThirdLove is inspired by our mission, engaged in their everyday work, and enjoy partnering with our teammates and customers. If you want to impact millions of people, find your fit, and propel your career forward, we’d love to hear from you.

What We Are Looking For

We are seeking a skilled and passionate Data Analyst to join our growing team. In this role, you will be responsible for collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting large datasets to extract meaningful insights that drive informed business decisions. Your analysis will directly support key areas including Marketing, CRM, Ecommerce, and Finance. The ideal candidate possesses a strong analytical mindset, a keen eye for detail, and excellent communication skills to effectively present findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.

What You Will Own And How You Will Make A Difference

          <strong>Who We Are<br><br></strong>ThirdLove disrupted the lingerie industry by empowering women to find their perfect fit online with our innovative Fitting Room® quiz and is one of the original brands to operate 100% direct-to-consumer. All design and R&amp;D is done in-house, and our extensive and complex supply chain is fully managed by our team. Inclusivity is at the core of who we are and how we serve our customers and build our teams.<br><br>Traditionally, women were given a choice between two options when it came to their bras and underwear: Be sexy, or be comfortable. Our Cofounders: Dave Spector, Heidi Zak, and Ra’el Cohen, thought that was outdated too — so, in 2013, they created ThirdLove — a third, better option, which doesn’t force us to choose between being sexy or comfortable.<br><br><strong>What Our Team Embodies<br><br></strong>Our culture is collaborative, fast-paced, and data-driven, and we were most recently recognized with the <em>Great Place to Work</em> certification. This recognition is given to a very small percentage of companies who apply for it and determined by employees’ real-time reports of their company culture. Earning this designation demonstrates to us that our team at ThirdLove is inspired by our mission, engaged in their everyday work, and enjoy partnering with our teammates and customers. If you want to impact millions of people, find your fit, and propel your career forward, we’d love to hear from you.<br><br><strong>What We Are Looking For<br><br></strong>We are seeking a skilled and passionate Data Analyst to join our growing team.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for fresh graduates who meet the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Enrolled in a quantitative Master’s program (e.g. Business Intelligence Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2024 or spring/summer 2025
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights



Preferred Qualifications


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects
Ability to learn new systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, San Francisco Bay Area, or New York City. We are hiring these positions in Chicago, IL or Toronto, Ontario, Canada.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have an absolute love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem, and living inside a spreadsheet/data set to find the answer to any question.
Because you love data, you have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis. Experience with Marketing APIs, Big Query or other Cloud Data Warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.), ETL Tools (Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics) and/or Python are all pluses.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and have spent a minimum of 1 year working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.




What You’ll Do:

Reporting: With your expertise in Advanced Excel, SQL, Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools, you’ll be maintaining customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence, generating pivot tables and other visualizations that summarize thousands of lines of data. You should have experience in translating performance media metrics into coherent, digestible reports for client ad campaigns and be comfortable communicating via Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.
Strategy: You’ll be responsible for learning our clients’ businesses and aligning their media strategy with business goals as well as understanding advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to help guide media buying strategy. With a background in paid media and/or digital advertising, you understand concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue and are able to be engaged in discussions with clients to gain trust and shareholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.




Gupta Media is an office-first (with flexibility) organization and we are excited to have our team working together again

We are currently looking for people to participate in our Menu Photo Collection project Finch.




What is the project about?

This project collects photos, live photos and short videos of menus (takeout menus, menus at restaurants, menus at boards, etc.). The photos collected will be used to support the development of technological products and services, including photo/video recognition services and artificial intelligence features.




This project can be a lot of fun! You can check your cabinets at home for takeaway menus, pick paper menus from your grocery store, go to a restaurant and check the dessert menu (even if you do not have a sweet tooth!), walk down the street and have a look at the chalkboard or the menu hanging at the door of an eatery. You can explore the almost unlimited variety of menus out there, dedicate a few minutes photographing them, and earn money you can spend on anything, even perhaps your next meal out!




Who is eligible?

To participate you should meet the following qualifying criteria:

Be 18 years or older.
Residing in the USA
Have an iPhone with iOS 17 or later with a functional camera.




Where is the project taking place?

This is a fully remote project. Note: all the photos should be taken within the USA.




How much is the compensation?

$0.80 USD per menu. For each menu you will need to take 2 photos. Due to the nature of the project, you will be able to participate many times with a variety of menus easy to obtain!




As payment method, we offer PayPal, Gift Card, Check and Wire Transfer according to your preference.




Please note that our Quality Assurance team will review all submissions to ensure they meet the project specific requirements. The project team will provide you with feedback once the Quality Check process is completed.




Questions or doubts?

If you have any doubts or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at: DataForce.Sourcing@transperfect.com

We're a high-tech home security company that's passionate about protecting the life you've built and our mission of keeping Every Home Secure. And we've created a culture here that cares just as deeply about the career you're building. Ours is a no ego culture of collaboration and innovation where those seeking their next challenge can find big opportunities and make a huge impact on the lives of all those who we protect. We don't just want you to work here. We want you to grow and thrive here.



We're embracing a hybrid work model that enables our teams to split their time between office and home. Hybrid for us means we expect our teams to come together in our state-of-the-art office on two core days, typically Tuesday and Wednesday, to work together in person, and teams can choose where they work for the remainder of the week. We all benefit from flexibility and get to use the best of both worlds to get our work done.

Why are we hiring?

Well, we're growing and thriving. So, we need smart, talented, and humble people who share our values to join us as we disrupt the home security space and relentlessly pursue our mission of keeping Every Home Secure.

We are …

a team of designers, strategists, engineers, writers, researchers and product folks based in downtown Boston. Over the past ten years, we've quietly transformed home security from an outdated, unfriendly industry to something elegant, thoughtful, and beautifully designed. We put our customers at the center of everything we do. We care deeply about their experience and we constantly try to delight them with innovative products and services that are fairly priced. Our top ratings in the App/Play store are a clear validation of our commitment to customer experience. Plus, CNET, the Wirecutter and PCMag all named us their Editors' Choice for home security.

To provide answers to the businesses' most critical questions, the analyst will identify, transform and combine data sources, creating dashboards and reports to provide visibility into key metrics and to explore relationships between customer data and outcomes of interest.

Success is defined as thoughtful, accurate, and timely delivery of key data sources and analysis, both as requested by stakeholders and independently driven.

Your responsibilities include:

Analyze large, complex data sets to identify trends, patterns, and insights that will drive business decisions.
Develop and maintain dashboards and reports that track KPIs for product performance and user behavior.
Collaborate with Engineering teams to define and measure metrics for new product features and enhancements.
Support UX/UI design decisions with data-driven insights and recommendations.
Communicate complex data findings in a clear and concise manner to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.


You've got ...


Bachelor's degree in a quantitative field such as Statistics, Mathematics, Economics, or Computer Science.
Up to 3 years of experience in a data analytics role, with a focus on product analytics.
Excellent communication skills and ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams.
Proficiency in SQL and data visualization tools such as Tableau, Looker, or Power BI.
Strong analytical skills and ability to work with large, complex data sets.
Experience with statistical analysis and experimental design.


What Values You'll Share:


Customer Obsessed - Building deep empathy for customers and developing strong, long-term relationships with them.
Aim High - Always challenging oneself and others to raise the bar.
No Ego - ""no job too small"" attitude, and open, inclusive and humble style.
One Team - highly collaborative approach to achieving success.
Lift As We Climb - A track record of investing in developing others and helping others succeed.
Lean & Nimble - working with agility and efficiency to experiment in an often-ambiguous environment.

We're a high-tech home security company that's passionate about protecting the life you've built and our mission of keeping Every Home Secure. And we've created a culture here that cares just as deeply about the career you're building. Ours is a no ego culture of collaboration and innovation where those seeking their next challenge can find big opportunities and make a huge impact on the lives of all those who we protect. We don't just want you to work here. We want you to grow and thrive here.



We're embracing a hybrid work model that enables our teams to split their time between office and home. Hybrid for us means we expect our teams to come together in our state-of-the-art office on two core days, typically Tuesday and Wednesday, to work together in person, and teams can choose where they work for the remainder of the week. We all benefit from flexibility and get to use the best of both worlds to get our work done.

Why are we hiring?

Well, we're growing and thriving. So, we need smart, talented, and humble people who share our values to join us as we disrupt the home security space and relentlessly pursue our mission of keeping Every Home Secure.

We are …

a team of designers, strategists, engineers, writers, researchers and product folks based in downtown Boston. Over the past ten years, we've quietly transformed home security from an outdated, unfriendly industry to something elegant, thoughtful, and beautifully designed. We put our customers at the center of everything we do. We care deeply about their experience and we constantly try to delight them with innovative products and services that are fairly priced. Our top ratings in the App/Play store are a clear validation of our commitment to customer experience. Plus, CNET, the Wirecutter and PCMag all named us their Editors' Choice for home security.

The Job …

As a Sr. Product Data Analyst, Monitoring at SimpliSafe, you will be responsible for providing insights and recommendations that help to optimize the performance of SimpliSafe's monitoring service portfolio. You will work closely with cross-functional teams including Product Management, Engineering, UX Design/Research, and Marketing to understand business requirements and identify opportunities for growth within the Monitoring organization.

The role involves designing, implementing, documenting and maintaining data sources that allow for efficient collection and evaluation of BI data. To provide answers to the businesses' most critical questions, the analyst will identify, transform and combine data sources, creating dashboards and reports to provide visibility into key metrics and to explore relationships between customer data and outcomes of interest.

Success is defined as thoughtful, accurate, and timely delivery of key data sources and analysis, both as requested by stakeholders and independently driven.

Your responsibilities include:


Partner with Product Management to define and understand Monitoring KPIs including engagement and cost models.
Analyze large, complex data sets to identify trends, patterns, and insights that will drive business decisions.
Develop and maintain dashboards and reports that track KPIs for product performance and user behavior.
Collaborate with Engineering teams to define and measure metrics for new product features and enhancements.
Support UX/UI design decisions with data-driven insights and recommendations.
Communicate complex data findings in a clear and concise manner to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.


You've got ...


Bachelor's degree in a quantitative field such as Statistics, Mathematics, Economics, or Computer Science.
Up to 3 years of experience in a data analytics role, with a focus on product analytics.
Excellent communication skills and ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams.
Proficiency in SQL and data visualization tools such as Tableau, Looker, or Power BI.
Strong analytical skills and ability to work with large, complex data sets.
Experience with statistical analysis and experimental design.


What Values You'll Share:


Customer Obsessed - Building deep empathy for customers and developing strong, long-term relationships with them.
Aim High - Always challenging oneself and others to raise the bar.
No Ego - ""no job too small"" attitude, and open, inclusive and humble style.
One Team - highly collaborative approach to achieving success.
Lift As We Climb - A track record of investing in developing others and helping others succeed.
Lean & Nimble - working with agility and efficiency to experiment in an often-ambiguous environment.
