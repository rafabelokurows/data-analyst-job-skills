Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for fresh graduates who meet the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Enrolled in a quantitative Master’s program (e.g. Business Intelligence Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2024 or spring/summer 2025
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights



Preferred Qualifications


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects
Ability to learn new systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, San Francisco Bay Area, or New York City. We are hiring these positions in Chicago, IL or Toronto, Ontario, Canada.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Are you looking for a fully remote position where you can contribute to the mission of combating preventable blindness and improving lives? Join us in helping patients preserve their vision and live healthier, longer lives through tailored, timely, and intelligent care. This could be the perfect opportunity for you!

About Lumata Health

Blindness is a devastating—but largely preventable—consequence of poorly managed chronic eye diseases like glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. These debilitating diseases are expected to double between 2020 and 2050, outpacing the capacity of providers and contributing to the rising cost of eye disorders in the US, which already exceeds $99B in direct medical costs annually. In over 95% of cases, disease progression can be slowed or stopped, preserving vision and extending healthspan. But doing so requires tailored, timely, and intelligent engagement throughout the patient's lifelong care journey. That's where Lumata comes in.

Lumata Health is leading the way in leveraging data-driven virtual care management to address this large and rapidly growing problem. Built with $2M in funding support from the National Eye Institute, Lumata Health's Intelligent Engagement Platform maximizes the impact of multichannel, personalized engagement by our team of JCAHPO-certified ophthalmic care coaches. Lumata takes a holistic approach to care—combining behavioral and psychosocial information with clinical data to create tailored, high-impact patient engagements. In addition to promoting adherence, we help patients overcome barriers to care by assisting with things like financial assistance programs, prescriptions and refills, insurance issues, transportation to visits, understanding their disease and care plan, and coordinating care with other providers.

With direct medical record access to hundreds of thousands of patients with vision-threatening chronic eye diseases and partnerships with over 1,400 eye care specialists in 34 states, Lumata Health is helping people affected by chronic eye conditions live healthier, longer lives.

We're looking for caring and committed teammates to join our mission of helping people see the world. If you're passionate about stopping preventable blindness, we hope you'll apply.
