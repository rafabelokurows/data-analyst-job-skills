Native German skills are a plus but not a must.

🌎 What we do

We build software that helps companies along the food system get to Net Zero.

~31% of global GHG emissions originate from food-related activities. For the first time in history, climate performance has become an overall business performance indicator. Enterprises are mandated by regulatory bodies to disclose their climate performance, which leads to increasing pressure from investors, competitors, retailers, and consumers to prevent and reduce their CO2e emissions. Over the next 10 years, companies have set ambitious reduction targets that need to be met. Enterprise software and new business processes can help.

We raised >€10m in funding in the first 2 years of our existence, we launched our enterprise product, signed and onboarded some of the largest F&B players in Europe, and put together what we believe is the best-suited early stage tech team in Europe. Will you be the next to join us? 🚀

🔭 What you will work on

Your mission

Help our users make sense of their data and pave the way to Net Zero Emissions.

Over The Next 12 Months You Will


Create Actionable Insights for Net Zero
Identify data patterns to help users understand and communicate their carbon footprints more effectively to customers and suppliers.
Turn emission data into clear, impactful insights for users so they can make better decisions.
Bridge data to real-world measures - our users and farmers don’t live in spreadsheets.
Build Prototypes and Products
Develop models and prototypes to help clients set targets and model Net Zero scenarios.
Develop a strong understanding of our users and their unique challenges.
Work closely with the product team to transform prototypes into scalable SaaS products.
Upskill the Team with Data & AI
Stay up-to-date with the latest trends in data analytics and AI product building.
Empower self-service across teams.
Foster a data-first culture in a fast-growing environment where it’s easy to simply listen to your gut feeling.

🚀 You might be really good for this role if


You have a ""get-it-done"" attitude and the ability to learn really fast.
You have a passion for putting together quick, hacky prototypes that you can put in front of users.
You understand and care equally as much about the “why” behind the numbers, you think outcome-first.
You constantly try out the latest AI tools and have experience building with no-code or low-code platforms like Airtable or Retool.
You were part of the first 20-30 employees at an early stage technology company.
You are highly reliable and can organise your work really well.


You don't feel like you fulfil all the criteria? We get it: confidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. But guess what?! There is no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. The only thing you need to ensure along the recruiting process and beyond is that the problem that we are solving with Root is one you cannot wait to get out of bed for on Monday morning! 🤗

🦾 How we support you


You will report directly to our co-founder: Eric
You will get mentored and coached by one of our angel investors and one of the best AI product builders in Europe: Tevfik


🎢 Hiring Process

Our ambition is to offer you an end-to-end experience that is fast and uncomplicated - we aim to keep the end-to-end process to 10 working days. We send you prep material for each step and maximise transparency at every step.

Get Mentored By World-class Company Builders

We decided on our cap table with a clear goal in mind: Set our team up for success. This is why we have selected a diverse group of food industry veterans, generalist company builders, and functional experts to join our journey from day 1. Beyond entrusting us with their capital, our angel investors act as mentors and sparring partners for our early team members in their corresponding roles. You will benefit from:


A dedicated mentor with whom you will build your personal relationship
Regular sparring sessions whenever you see fit
Adhoc Q&A where needed


Not looking for a new role but know someone who does?

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead.

We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly.
