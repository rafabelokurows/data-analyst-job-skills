Want to make an impact? Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.

We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.

Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, we work closely with our teams in Barcelona, San Antonio, Spokane, and remote locations. We’ve got a reputation for being a great place to work, having been named among the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Seattle Business Magazine and Washington’s Best Workplaces in the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies.

At Rover, our furry coworkers are just as important as our human ones—and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Along with making the joys of pet parenthood more accessible, we’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community of pet people—and that starts with our employees.

Who we're looking for:

We are specifically looking for a Business Analyst III to partner closely with Rover’s Customer Experience leadership team as well as our Strategy & Operational Excellence team to help make Rover’s operations more efficient and drive better customer outcomes. This will be a high visibility role, partnering directly with a diverse set of stakeholders to determine how to measure and improve Rovers’s support experience. This role will be responsible for varied deep analyses into strategic business questions that will shape Rover’s customer support strategy. The ideal candidate should be very comfortable turning ambiguous business problems into crisp requirements, and in turn using those to build creative data products meeting a niche business need - all with a relative degree of autonomy.

Your Responsibilities:


Partner with Operations leadership to determine our strategy for measuring department health and performance, defining comprehensive metrics, developing crisp, well documented reporting and standing up performance monitoring rhythms
Work closely with the Strategy & Operational Excellence team to develop strategies that drive operational efficiency, providing robust monitoring and analysis on their performance
Serve as strategic partner and advisor to business leaders, responsible for making recommendations on investments and optimization strategies across the Operations department
Design and conduct experiments and analysis in support of Operations Scalability product improvements or Operational Process improvements
Support the construction of our reporting abstractions (built in dbt)



Your Qualifications:


At least 4 years experience working cross-functionally with complex datasets to support organizational decision making.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Specifically, you know how to narrate analysis and results to business partners in a useful, concise, and meaningful way
You are extremely comfortable with taking ambiguous issues and structuring them into crisp business problems, and using those to develop and execute on a refined project plan with clearly identified deliverables, all with relative autonomy
Strong proficiency with SQL. You would feel confident reviewing code produced by other analysts and data scientists
You have hands-on experience building out data abstractions using tools such as DBT or Airflow as well as a variety of data visualization tools (e.g., Mode, Looker, Periscope, Tableau, etc.)
You can independently prioritize projects based on return on investment and own the end-to-end project management for our analytics deliverables
You are excited to help mentor junior analysts



Nice to Have:


Masters degree in a quantitative field OR on the job experience with applied statistics
Ability to code in Python/R is a plus
Hands-on experience working with customer service tool data sets (e.g., Zendesk)
Hands-on experience running A/B tests and experiment design



Benefits:


Competitive compensation
Long-term incentive plan with a company performance-based cash payout
Permanent contract
Pension Plan
Meal tickets through Cobee
Generous PTO Allowance
Hybrid schedule
Private health insurance
Discounted Gym Membership
Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time)
Monetary help for adopting a dog plus yearly credit to use on our platform
Flexible work hours, sometimes you’ll need to be in at certain times, but on the whole, we’re pretty flexible when it comes to managing workload and time
Grab snacks, fresh fruit, in our kitchen to keep yourself going
Regular team activities, including happy hours, game nights, and more



Location:


This role is based in Barcelona. We have a hybrid-working environment where all teams come together to the office every Monday and Thursday, and the flexibility to work from home the rest of the week.
Candidates must be based in Barcelona (or willing to relocate)
Applicants must hold the right to live and work in Spain - we do not sponsor visas

I am Marta, the recruiter for this role. I love the fall, to travel and read. Lovely to meet you!

Perhaps this is the 10th Job Description you read today, sitting on your couch with Netflix playing in the background, or contemplating your life planning to refresh your career. I am sure by now all offers look the same.

I will be honest with you, at Zurich we do not claim to be perfect, but we are pretty cool! If you want to know why, keep reading!

But first, THANK YOU for showing interest in our company. We know that a job search can be challenging, but don’t worry, what goes around comes around!

Let’s get straight to the point! I will try to sum up our DNA in 2 essential points:


We love volunteering but we prefer to be Change Activists. What does that mean? We focus our efforts in helping youths in risk of social marginalization and fighting climate change by reforesting parks or woods in Madrid and in the Doñana Forest. This year alone, we have already volunteered for over 14,000h!
At Zurich we say it loud and clear: We are proud of our colors, we believe that a diverse and inclusive team makes the difference. We don’t discuss disability, we discuss capability! We want you to be yourself, without closets in between or glass ceilings making you fragile. 50% of our high responsibility positions are occupied by women (including our Executive Committee). Do you know that we produce our own podcasts about gender identity? We are building a company were everyone is welcome!


At this point you might be asking yourself: Marta, how will be my day to day wearing the blue sweater? I asked that question too.

We are looking for a Data Scientist/Engineer to join the AI team to use data to accelerate innovation and bring value across the business verticals. Your objective will be using available data to solve complex business problems across the organization. This person will provide analysis and develop AI solutions that help business with decision making.

The Advanced Analytics team at Zurich is formed of Data Scientists that use data to accelerate innovation and bring value across the business verticals.


Working with Gitlab to manage projects and python scripts.
Providing support to other team members about python programming best-practices to improve efficiency, interpretability and to avoid hardcoding.
Building new models using advanced statistical knowledge and ML techniques to answer strategic business questions across the organization.
Conducting moderate to high complexity analyses under general direction.
Conducting ad-hoc analysis required by business team.
Identifying detailed data needs and structure to support model development.
Cleaning and organizing data for its analysis.
Manipulating and integrating data to highlight patterns, relationships, anomalies and trends.
Managing new data sources, deep analysis and insights, developing testing strategies.
Deployment and follow-up of the models in cloud (preferably in AWS).
Influencing key cross-functional business stakeholders by delivering analyses and recommendations.


How do you know you fit in? I’ll explain:

Don’t worry, we are not asking you to save the planet or meet 100% of the requirements.


Minimum BS/BA in Computer Science, Information Systems, Mathematics, Physics, Artificial Intelligence or a related technical/data intensive field, a plus being holding a MSc
Experience at least 5 years working with Python (any framework of development) with good practice of development and code optimization. Expertise in version control (Git). API development and testing tools.
Experience with deployment processes and code analysis (CI/CD, Jenkins, Postman).
Knowledge of python analytic tools (nltk, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy) & SQL, Computer Vision (Image Segmentation, Image Classification - Tensorflow, Keras and PyTorch; OCR - e.g., Google Cloud Vision, Tesseract), Pyspark (You don’t need to be an expert on these, but it would be great if you have used some of them in the past).
You worked in data analytics projects or have deployed models in AWS using Amazon SageMaker Studio to cover the entire machine learning workflow would be considered a plus.
Proven team player.
Highly organized, creative, and solution oriented.
Good written and verbal communication skills and problem-solving capabilities.
Proactive.
Strong drive for excellence.
Fluent in Spanish and English.


Right now, either you feel as great as when you fit into the right size of your jeans or you are thinking “this is not for me” (and that’s ok, we will meet again in a bright future). However, you can share my contact with those near you who you feel might be a fit to the job.

At Zurich we love to live life to the fullest. I would love to know how we can make you happy, but for me, balance between life and work makes the difference. Flexibility and digital disconnection are real and encouraged.

#PorSerDeZurich, you can choose the benefits that best fit your needs. We all know that “to each their own”.


FlexWork: We love flexibility. We want to offer you a flexible hybrid mode so that you can organize your work schedule as you wish. We also offer you a home office extra bonus.
We believe you learn by doing, which means we allow movement of our employees in between different departments, both locally and at an international level thanks to the program “Talent in Motion”. And so, you can further your knowledge and growth, we offer English classes, training, and a personal mentoring program.
Flexible remuneration: You will be able to choose what suits you best! Choose from medical insurance, training, volunteering programs, kindergarten and so much more!
At Zurich we know that putting a smile on someone else’s face is easier than you think! That’s why we are activists! We will gift you a whole working day to dedicate to the cause that is closer to your heart.
Referral bonus if you bring other top talent like you! Just remember - we are not looking for perfection, so feel free to share my contact information with people you know who might be a good match, and I will be happy to meet them.
If Sport Spice as always been your favorite, now is your chance to get fit! Marathons, gym discounts and much more! Are you ready to go?
Do you prefer the beach or the mountains? You will have 25 vacation days, plus insurance day and your birthday to do all the things you love the most. But fear not, we mean real digital disconnection. Because we all know life is short and you deserve a good rest!
At Zurich we think about the future, therefore offer a retirement plan and life insurance and discounts in banking and other insurance products.


If you managed to read up to this point, THANK YOU! We are pretty cool, aren’t we?

 

If you feel butterflies in your stomach and you think we are a match, send smoke signs… or your CV if you think the smoke thing won’t cut it.

 

And to top it off, do you want to know what Zurich employees think? I could tell you we are nº1 Top Employers in Spain, but we would love you to hear it from our people by visiting our Glassdoor profile. No blessing in disguise!

I hope to meet you soon!

Amplemarket's premise is that a lot of the playbooks used by B2B sales teams that worked 5 years ago don't cut it anymore.

In today's environment, sales teams need to have a tremendous amount of information about their prospects to decide when is the best moment and channel to reach out in the most relevant way. You can't do this with 5 different data/sales enablement point solutions that don't share the same data schema and barely communicate with each other. Amplemarket is the all-in-one compound solution that enables this.

Our AI-powered sales platform helps B2B companies generate more opportunities thanks to our advanced lead generation engine, hyper-personalized sequencing, omnichannel outreach, and AI-powered smart actions. We are backed by Y Combinator, and we are powering the sales teams at some of the fastest-growing companies in the world like Deel, Moveworks, H1 and Vanta.
