Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for fresh graduates who meet the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Enrolled in a quantitative Master’s program (e.g. Business Intelligence Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2024 or spring/summer 2025
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights



Preferred Qualifications


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects
Ability to learn new systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, San Francisco Bay Area, or New York City. We are hiring these positions in Chicago, IL or Toronto, Ontario, Canada.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

4+ years hands on technical analysis work with SQL experience performing complex data transformations. Experience manipulating large data sets and uncovering insights utilizing disparate data sources and tools.
Deep understanding of marketing analytics, including multi-touch attribution models (e.g., first-touch, last-touch, time-decay), media mix modeling, and ROI measurement across channels.
Proven experience using tools like Mixpanel, Google Analytics 4 (GA4), and Tableau to track and analyze marketing performance.
Experience with marketing funnel analysis, including diagnosing drop-offs, conversion bottlenecks, and optimization strategies to improve efficiency.
Track record of improving marketing KPIs, such as CAC, LTV, ROAS, and overall funnel conversion rates through data-driven insights.
Strong analytical skills with the ability to apply business strategy to data analysis and recommendations.
Expert in data visualization (Tableau/Looker/etc).
Strong communication skills. Ability to tell story with data and explain the nuance to stakeholders.
Ability to think strategically (interfacing with senior leaders), while also enjoying being hands-on with the data.
A knack for asking the right questions, then answering them with sound data and analysis.
Experience with dbt/git/aws is a plus.



Octave's Company Values:

The below values drive our day-to-day operations.


We’re human beings first. We operate with empathy and kindness – with our clients, with our collaborators, and with ourselves.
People deserve better than status quo. We’re willing to tackle the intractable problems, no matter how big, because someone should. We ask big questions, we craft big solutions, and we challenge ourselves and others to make it happen.
No bystanders. No stars. No tourists. Each person has been selected to be here, and with that comes a responsibility to bring your expertise, share your ideas, and help make this company better.
Partnership paves the path ahead. We don’t operate in a silo, internally or externally. To transform the system, we believe in working with others to create something bigger, better, and stronger.
Quality is crucial at scale. Quality is core to our business, and we refuse to sacrifice it as we grow.
Progress is a process. In the pursuit of progress, we iterate, reflect, learn, adjust – and always leave things better than we found them.
There are people behind every data point. We recognize that numbers tell only one part of the story, and we also do the work to understand impacts at the individual level



Physical Requirements:


Prolonged periods sitting at a desk and working on a computer.
Must be able to frequently communicate with others through virtual meeting applications such as Zoom and Google Meet.
Must be able to observe and communicate information on company provided laptop.

Snapshot

We’re looking for an applied data analyst to join Google DeepMind’s internal data & analytics group. Working closely with stakeholders, you will provide clarity and structure to ambiguous business problems to guide strategic decisions specifically around our compute and infrastructure strategy, contributing directly to Google DeepMind’s mission of bringing the benefits of AI to the world!

About Us

Artificial Intelligence could be one of humanity’s most useful inventions. At Google DeepMind, we’re a team of scientists, engineers, machine learning experts and more, working together to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence. We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.

You’ll join the Core Analytics Team (CAT) within the Tech Ops & Analytics group at Google DeepMind, comprising a software engineer & data scientists and analysts. We ultimately aim to drive better organisational decisions – blending our technical skillset with rich stakeholder relationships to deliver impact. The outcomes of our work, ranging across topics like (but not limited to!) compute purchase and efficiency, research organisation, and recruitment optimisation, directly influence Google DeepMind’s progress towards our mission.

The role

We’re looking for someone who is skilled at and motivated by helping make sound decisions using quantitative data. This role will specialise in the area of compute management exploring areas like the efficiency of our accelerators and infrastructure.

You’ll bring a particular expertise and perspective around how to most effectively conduct analyses – liaising with engineering colleagues to ensure we collect the right telemetry at source, and working with technical program managers to translate those (and other!) insights into clear decisions both for leadership and process owners.

You’ll also be expected to contribute to our team environment – sharing your knowledge, coaching other analysts, helping articulate and prioritise our common roadmap, and using your experience of analytics in other organisations to make improvements to how we operate.

A core set of the responsibilities this role encompasses:


Work with partners to identify relevant high-level product & business questions and propose appropriate data-focused analysis
Conduct rigorous, verifiable analysis (SQL, Python) to answer those questions
Develop tools (dashboards, reports, web apps) to enable continuous monitoring of key metrics and enable user self-service
Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to analyse large and complex datasets aiming to extract actionable recommendations
Communicate via presentations and written reports to a wide variety of stakeholders (with varying levels of seniority, technical and domain familiarity) – following through to ensure impact
Manage several projects simultaneously, exhibiting good project and time management skills (timelines, expectations, progress, etc.)
Collaborate effectively as part of a team of other data scientists, analysts, engineers and project managers
Recommend changes to product/engineering roadmaps to improve data quality in source systems
Submit tested code into source control for review
Coach and mentor others in their own use of analytical tools and techniques


About You

We're looking for an experienced data analyst with a proven ability to translate complex business challenges into impactful data-driven solutions. You thrive in a fast-paced environment, are comfortable working independently, and excel at communicating insights to diverse audiences.

Key Requirements:


SQL Expertise: You are highly proficient in using SQL to extract, manipulate, and analyze data to solve complex business problems.
Stakeholder Management & Data Storytelling: You have a strong track record of effectively collaborating with and presenting to a variety of stakeholders, including senior leadership.
Fast-Paced Delivery: You are comfortable working in a dynamic environment and consistently meet deadlines while maintaining a high standard of work.
Independent Execution: You are a self-starter who can take ownership of projects and deliver high-quality analysis with minimal supervision.


Additional qualities we value:


Experience with cloud compute metrics, systems, and analytics infrastructure.
An interest in compute and infrastructure efficiency.
Proficiency in Python and the PyData stack (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Jupyter).
A solid understanding of statistical concepts and the ability to apply them in analysis.
A passion for continuous learning and expanding your skill set.
The ability to translate data into meaningful stories and actionable insights.
A collaborative mindset and eagerness to work with others to achieve common goals.


If you don’t think you embody all of the above criteria, please still seriously consider applying! This role (and therefore the requirements) is broad, and we’d be excited to discuss how you see yourself contributing across it.

The US base salary range for this full-time position is between $122,000 - $186,000,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your targeted location during the hiring process.

Note: In the event your application is successful and an offer of employment is made to you, any offer of employment will be conditional on the results of a background check, performed by a third party acting on our behalf.

We believe that real estate is one of life’s great adventures. And, as we’ve helped Canadians navigate these uncharted waters, we’ve become the best real estate search platform in the country, and the leading marketplace in BC with an audience twice the size of our nearest rival.

We’ve done this by carefully assembling a team of great people who have great ideas. One of those genius-level ideas is to make REW quite simply the best place in the world to work - and we’d like your help to get there. Yup, really.

And that’s where you come in.

We’re searching for a hugely-motivated Data Analyst to help our Data Engineering Team better understand how our customers use our products, and - more importantly - to translate that understanding into insights that can transform our business.

A love of working with amazing people will be viewed as a plus, too.

Rocking the role.

Data is at the heart of everything we do at REW. Every day, our platform ingests feeds from dozens of sources to compile, composite and augment the listings that thousands of homeseekers search through in their quest for the perfect home.

But listings are only part of the puzzle. We also track market behaviour to help inform our own next steps and to empower the agents, landlords, and property developers who count on REW to give them an edge. And while we are awash in all this data, we sometimes risk losing sight of what works and what doesn’t.

That’s where we’d love your help, fellow adventurer.

You’d be joining a small team who are already evolving REW’s data platform, and act as a vital link between our platform and business stakeholders.

With a Great Role comes Great Responsibilities.

Collaborate with product development teams to provide insight to power new features and monitor their performance
Develop reports or data visualization tools for internal use to help support the REW's sales and marketing efforts
Participate in project planning and analysis as needed


Who you are is far more important than where you’ve been.

At least one year of professional experience with Tableau or other data visualization tools such as PowerBI, and/or Google DataStudio

Proficiency in SQL and Python (or a similar language for data processing) with exposure to other scripting or object-oriented programming languages
Strong experience in data modelling and quantitative analysis, plus data analysis concepts like data visualization, dashboard design and data mining


Who you are and your life at REW.


You are passionate about personal and professional growth, always seeking new knowledge and innovative technologies
You thrive on sharing insights and knowledge with peers to foster a culture of learning and continuous improvement
You can maintain a balance between independent work and teamwork, contributing positively to team dynamics and company culture
Analysis is in your DNA, enabling you to craft insightful and maintainable dashboards that tell and compelling story of the data for all stakeholders
You communicate technical designs and concepts with clarity, ensuring alignment and understanding across the team.
You are committed to continuous learning, staying up to date with the company’s products and features to drive and improve performance analytics
You are willing to work primarily in-office at our Vancouver location


What we can offer you.

In addition to competitive compensation, we provide a comprehensive benefits package, the best equipment for you to do your best work, and awesome perks and team events to keep you connected. Annual base salary for this role is $90,000 - $120,000 per year, dependant on experience.

We believe that real estate is one of life’s great adventures. And, as we’ve helped Canadians navigate these uncharted waters, we’ve become the best real estate search platform in the country, and the leading marketplace in BC with an audience twice the size of our nearest rival.

We’ve done this by carefully assembling a team of great people who have great ideas. One of those genius-level ideas is to make REW quite simply the best place in the world to work - and we’d like your help to get there. Yup, really.

And that’s where you come in.

We’re searching for a hugely-motivated Data Analyst to help our Data Engineering Team better understand how our customers use our products, and - more importantly - to translate that understanding into insights that can transform our business.

A love of working with amazing people will be viewed as a plus, too.

Rocking the role.

Data is at the heart of everything we do at REW. Every day, our platform ingests feeds from dozens of sources to compile, composite and augment the listings that thousands of homeseekers search through in their quest for the perfect home.

But listings are only part of the puzzle. We also track market behaviour to help inform our own next steps and to empower the agents, landlords, and property developers who count on REW to give them an edge. And while we are awash in all this data, we sometimes risk losing sight of what works and what doesn’t.

That’s where we’d love your help, fellow adventurer.

You’d be joining a small team who are already evolving REW’s data platform, and act as a vital link between our platform and business stakeholders.

With a Great Role comes Great Responsibilities.

Strong experience in data modelling and quantitative analysis, plus data analysis concepts like data visualization, dashboard design and data mining

You are committed to continuous learning, staying up to date with the company’s products and features to drive and improve performance analytics
You are willing to work primarily in-office at our Vancouver location

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have an absolute love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem, and living inside a spreadsheet/data set to find the answer to any question.
Because you love data, you have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis. Experience with Marketing APIs, Big Query or other Cloud Data Warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.), ETL Tools (Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics) and/or Python are all pluses.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and have spent a minimum of 1 year working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.




What You’ll Do:

Reporting: With your expertise in Advanced Excel, SQL, Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools, you’ll be maintaining customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence, generating pivot tables and other visualizations that summarize thousands of lines of data. You should have experience in translating performance media metrics into coherent, digestible reports for client ad campaigns and be comfortable communicating via Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.
Strategy: You’ll be responsible for learning our clients’ businesses and aligning their media strategy with business goals as well as understanding advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to help guide media buying strategy. With a background in paid media and/or digital advertising, you understand concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue and are able to be engaged in discussions with clients to gain trust and shareholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.
