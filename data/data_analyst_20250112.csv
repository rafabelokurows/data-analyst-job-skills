Alongside this, you’ll spend the other half of your time analysing the ESG data and markets, looking for ways you can influence and impact the firm’s performance.

The role

We are seeking an ambitious individual with a professional and proactive approach to join our Market Intelligence team.




In collaboration with our consulting team, the Market Intelligence Unit empowers our clients to navigate the market landscape with confidence. We provide insights on both a macro level and through in-depth competitor and market analysis. Your role will involve creating and maintaining innovative data tools that are essential for both internal and external use. You’ll handle large datasets gathered from both online sources and traditional research methods, ensuring their consistency and integrity.




Beyond data management, you’ll have the opportunity to present your findings in impactful ways, making a real difference in our clients’ strategic decisions.




Although the primary focus of this role is data management, we are a growing business. There is potential for advancement within the Market Intelligence Unit, allowing you to assume greater responsibilities over time.




Candidate requirements

Our team has a broad range of backgrounds and interests but everyone is an outperformer, always striving to be the best. They have shown this in their careers to date by doing something exceptional or thinking about things differently.




We do not want robots and we certainly don’t want egos. We are a small team where everyone is expected to support each other. There is no need or tolerance for sharp elbows.




We like people who thrive in uncertainty and see it as an opportunity. We like people who think creatively and commercially, always thinking about how we can enhance our market position. At interview, we like hearing about the knocks people have taken and how they’ve bounced back – because overcoming adversity is a critical skill for a high-growth challenger consultancy with a big vision.




We are looking for candidates with the following qualifications and experience:

A degree from a reputable university
Experience building excel models and managing data
Experience of financial analysis and research
Strong data analysis and data visualisation capabilities – experience in using PowerBI or similar tools ideal
Prior experience within the non-life insurance sector is advantageous but not essential
Willingness to travel to London if based in Belfast
Strong personal and professional motivation

You proactively identify patterns, risks, and opportunities to build scalable, data-driven solutions

You're structured and like organisation
You've an excellent work ethic and can manage workloads well
You are able to work effectively within a remote team, it can have its challenges



To be successful in this role, your values matter just as much as skills. Does this sound like you? ✨

🟢We are Kind and Empathetic = Our behaviour and words assume the best in people

🟢We are Always A Team = We are bound together by accountability

🟢We are Curious = A bunch from various backgrounds. We ask questions, plan things out, push the boundaries, challenge the status quo and welcome creativity

🟢We Take Ownership & Deliver = We are focused on our goals and love the details

✅Why work for Vable?


You want ownership of the Data Analytics within Vable
We have a culture that we protect, we value the contributions each Vabler makes
We encourage constant learning so you can keep up to date. A yearly budget of £250 is made available to each Vable employee for continuous learning and development
We encourage creativity and like new ideas and concentrate on the Cultural Add, not fit
We provide comprehensive healthcare cover following probation
You receive a MacBook, monitor and other required technical equipment when you join

❌Why it may not be for you:

We have various meetings per week and people are expected to attend and contribute

Everyone has the opportunity to query, ask questions, have new ideas and we will give you our opinion. We operate on continuous feedback and recognition. This isn't for everyone and if this makes you uncomfortable or it's not your thing, this may not be the right fit
We are very transparent and all work is stored on shared drives. Colleagues will give input and it's expected that you will actively adhere to this approach

Simply Business is an online business insurance brokerage that specialises in one thing: protecting the businesses their customers are working hard to build. Since they started life in 2005, they have helped over three million small businesses and self-employed people find the protection that’s right for them, from builders to bakers and personal trainers. Their big idea was to reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible, while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that they believe small businesses and landlords are entitled to.




Their story - continued commitment to doing the right thing




2005 seems like a long time ago. Simply Business – a small company with a big idea. To transform the way that other small businesses could get the insurance that they need. To reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that small businesses are entitled to. To protect them from harm. To keep their livelihoods safe. And to do all this with the promise of positive service. Delivered by happy people, working flexibly, learning constantly. With a restlessly innovative spirit. Within a business committed to doing the right thing. All of the time.




As they've grown, they've tried hard to keep true to this. To ourselves, to their 800 strong team and to the 3.5m customers that they've served so far. And as they move forward, as they enter a big new market, as they grow responsibly, as they improve their products, as they offer their customers more of what they need, of what they deserve, they'll hold onto the focus of that small company with the big idea. Protecting and serving businesses across the UK and the US. From barbers to bakers, consultants to cleaners, they are the backbone of the economy.




And they'll continue to stand by them. Bit by bit helping their dreams grow, just like ours.




Why do they need this role?




This role will sit within the global Data and Analytics team (DNA) in Simply Business. DNA has been central to empowering data-driven decision making at SB. They have invested heavily in their data pipeline, data engineering and their business intelligence capabilities.
In 2023 and beyond, they will continue investing a significant amount of effort in ramping up their Business Intelligence capabilities to drive business decisions.
The primary duty of this role will be to provide analytical support for their business stakeholders. This includes leading the measurement and evaluation of their product value streams and ensuring that they continuously improve the effectiveness of their product investments.

In this role, you will:




Create data models in their Snowflake data warehouse
Integrate new sources of data to enrich their analytical capabilities
Work with the engineering and product teams to ensure application design accommodates reporting and analytics requirements
Work with various business and engineering teams to ensure reliable, scalable, robust architecture for their analytics platform and ETL pipelines
Partner with stakeholders to identify business use cases and translate them into the right analytical problem that you will build, test and productionize
Particular focus will be on use cases that will help them drive operational efficiencies as the organization scales.
Increase the organization's ability to convert more customers.
Clearly communicate data-driven insights and recommendations to non-technical audiences
Contribute to longer term strategic DNA projects




What are they looking for:




At least 3 years of overall experience in data & analytics, operational analytics experience is desired;
Degree with analytics or software engineering experience or equivalent work experience;
Experience with cloud data warehouses such as Snowflake or similar;
Experience designing and creating SQL data models using dbt (dbt Certification a plus);

Experience in Python or another programming language (e.g. Kotlin, Scala, Ruby) is welcomed

Sylvera provides carbon data for genuine climate impact. Our mission is to incentivize investment in real climate action.

Purchasing credits through the carbon markets is one of the most established and scalable ways to channel finance from the private sector to effective climate solutions and work toward societal net zero. Unfortunately, the voluntary carbon markets have been plagued with mistrust and a lack of effectiveness since they’ve emerged – until Sylvera.

To help organizations ensure they're making the most effective investments, Sylvera builds software that independently and accurately automates the evaluation of carbon projects that capture, remove, or avoid emissions. With Sylvera's data and tools, businesses and governments can confidently invest in, benchmark, deliver, and report real climate impact.

Our team is made up of leading minds in climate change from scientists to policy, finance and carbon market experts. We work in partnership with scientific organisations, universities, governments and think tanks to develop and test rigorous and holistic ratings methodologies, leveraging the latest technology. Founded in 2020, Sylvera has employees worldwide with offices in London, New York, Belgrade and Singapore. We’ve raised over $96million from leading VCs like Balderton Capital, Index Ventures and Insight Partners to date.

✨ Who we are

Co-founded by Mikhail Dubov and Dmitry Isupov in 2015 while at Entrepreneur First, Chattermill was born out of their frustration that it took weeks, sometimes months, for customer research to yield any quality insights. Often, these would be out of date by the time they reached decision-makers. And it was also financially out of reach for most companies. When they started what eventually became Chattermill, they had a hunch that they could use the newly available tech of deep learning to help companies find insights amidst messy data. Their vision was to take what agencies and cutting-edge brands were doing by hand and automate it. Today, our Unified Customer Intelligence platform is used by the world’s best-loved customer-centric companies, including Uber, HelloFresh, Wise, and more, all of whom can now see and act on their customer reality.

Our Mission & Vision

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users.

For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

We believe that real estate is one of life’s great adventures. And, as we’ve helped Canadians navigate these uncharted waters, we’ve become the best real estate search platform in the country, and the leading marketplace in BC with an audience twice the size of our nearest rival.

We’ve done this by carefully assembling a team of great people who have great ideas. One of those genius-level ideas is to make REW quite simply the best place in the world to work - and we’d like your help to get there. Yup, really.

And that’s where you come in.

We’re searching for a hugely-motivated Data Analyst to help our Data Engineering Team better understand how our customers use our products, and - more importantly - to translate that understanding into insights that can transform our business.

Rocking the role.

Data is at the heart of everything we do at REW. Every day, our platform ingests feeds from dozens of sources to compile, composite and augment the listings that thousands of homeseekers search through in their quest for the perfect home.

But listings are only part of the puzzle. We also track market behaviour to help inform our own next steps and to empower the agents, landlords, and property developers who count on REW to give them an edge. And while we are awash in all this data, we sometimes risk losing sight of what works and what doesn’t.

That’s where we’d love your help, fellow adventurer.

You’d be joining a small team who are already evolving REW’s data platform, and act as a vital link between our platform and business stakeholders.

With a Great Role comes Great Responsibilities.

You are committed to continuous learning, staying up to date with the company’s products and features to drive and improve performance analytics
You are willing to work primarily in-office at our Vancouver location
