As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem-solving skills, and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.

UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits, and natural beauty.


The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)

is an independent research organization at the University of Washington (UW). Its mission is to deliver to the world timely, relevant, and scientifically valid evidence to improve health policy and practice. IHME carries out its mission through a range of projects within different research areas including the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD), Injuries, and Risk Factors; Future Health Scenarios; Cost Effectiveness and Efficiency; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations.

IHME is committed to providing the evidence base necessary to help solve the world’s most important health problems. This requires creativity and innovation, which are cultivated by an inclusive, diverse, and equitable environment that respects and appreciates differences, embraces collaboration, and invites the voices of all IHME team members.


IHME has an outstanding opportunity for a

Temporary

Data Extraction Analyst

on the Malaria, Anemia, Vaccines, Hemoglobin, and Neglected Tropical Diseases Team.

The main purpose of this position is to provide highly specialized oversight and guidance of routine but complex extraction processes for input data used in modeling, papers, and presentations at IHME. The Data Extraction Analyst will provide support to key research projects through data extraction and formatting, and providing inputs for papers and presentations.

The Data Extraction Analyst will support work on a new grant, under which IHME will aim to provide novel contributions to the global neglected tropical diseases (NTD) research community that supports progress towards NTD control and elimination by extending the scope and depth of our current NTD work into two new areas of research: (1) providing more detailed analyses and visualizations of NTD burden beyond what exists within the current GBD framework, and (2) working with other partners to generate granular estimates of schistosomiasis prevalence and burden. These novel extensions of our previous work will ultimately guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of policies and practices aimed at controlling and eliminating NTDs worldwide.

The Data Extraction Analyst is expected to become specialized in data pertaining to relevant content areas and will consult with staff as needed. To create the array of indicators required, this position provides guidance on the extraction of all available relevant quantitative data from surveys, censuses, literature, and administrative records into central databases. This position will collate, clean, and extract data from survey, literature, vital registration, and other sources that have been identified. By doing so they will catalog a library of data that will add to the foundation of the Institute. Relevant data include those on mortality, causes of death, epidemiology, and a range of determinants and risk factors, such as education, income, or air pollution.

The position must have a strong command of a variety of research needs and analytic functions. The Data Extraction Analyst must be able to anticipate the needs of research teams, as well as other functional teams including the Global Engagement Team, Technology Team, and Research Management as it pertains to the work of data extraction. This position will work with dynamic teams of researchers and staff at all levels and will work alongside other research staff on complementary projects requiring a foundational knowledge of IHME’s work, as well as core technical skills and collective problem-solving. Overall, the Data Extraction Analyst will be a critical member of an agile, dynamic team.

This position is contingent on funding availability.

At a high level:


Implementation Engineers are primarily responsible for understanding the raw data from our state partners and transforming it into our comprehensive, unified data layer.
Data Analysts are primarily responsible for using that transformed data to produce information to power our tools and insights to use in analyses.


Our team will review your application and consider you for the role that matches your background & skill sets best.





Recidiviz is thrilled to be hiring a Data Analyst to join our team! We're a small, fast-moving group that works with complex criminal justice data from our state partners and develops analyses and tools that target the drivers of incarceration. That's where you come in. We're looking for someone who has attention to detail to improve our analysis, creativity and inquisitiveness to identify and solve open-ended problems, clarity to think through complex and variable data, flexibility to adjust in a rapidly evolving environment, and above all else, a collaborative, kind nature to add to our culture.

About Us

Recidiviz is creating safer, healthier communities by improving outcomes for people in the criminal justice system. We build technology to reduce the number of people in prison and to help criminal justice leaders embrace data-driven decision-making.

Using software tools and thoughtful product design, we've been able to safely and permanently reduce incarceration and improve outcomes. We work side-by-side with leaders of the criminal justice system, people in prison and on supervision, and ecosystem partners to build a better path forward. In addition to the revenue we earn from state partners, some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations support our work.

People who succeed at Recidiviz lead with kindness and humility, assume good intent, learn from failure, and fix problems when they see them. They are excited to work arm in arm with government leadership and staff to improve outcomes. They are great listeners. They build deep relationships with and empathy for the people we work with and the people who our mission serves, even when those two groups feel at odds.

About The Role

This role collaborates across several teams to guide work that targets the drivers of incarceration. Our Data Analysts work with diverse data – criminal justice data both raw and processed from across the country, reports and policy documents from government agencies, and much more – to develop our understanding of the criminal justice system and to motivate change. They perform analyses, contribute to tooling that improve our data and how we work with it, and help drive product launches by ensuring each product in each state has the analytical data required to drive the impact we seek. Our Data Analysts also play a key role in contextualizing and presenting their analyses to key stakeholders, both internal and external.

Travel is encouraged approximately once a quarter, and occasionally required.

More about Recidiviz

Recidiviz was an all-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we've built an A-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator's 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.

Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) over 18 state partners – big and small, red and blue – and covers more than 40% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners – from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.

To learn more about how we do what we do, check out our 2023 Year in Review, read some press coverage, or watch our TED Talk. And if you're really keen to see our work, you can dive into our Github :).

An important note

Lasting change is always built on diversity.

We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners – from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.<br><br>To learn more about how we do what we do, check out our 2023 Year in Review, read some press coverage, or watch our TED Talk.

At Dagster Labs, we're an early-stage, well-funded startup team with a proven track record of shipping open-source software with global adoption. Our mission is to empower organizations to create scalable, productive data platforms. We put a premium on respectful, clear, and complete communication, and we expect each other to be creative, curious, effective, and empathetic.

We believe deeply that the right tools and abstractions enable not just technological transformation, but also organizational transformation. We strive to put the user and their hard work at the center of our decision making. In practice, that means we are looking for engineers who want to write clean APIs and helpful error messages, and who always try to understand user needs when designing a new system.

All of our open-source work is done publicly. You can gain context about how we collaborate as a team and the problems we work on by exploring GitHub and looking at our code reviews.

About the role

As a Senior GTM Analyst, you will be responsible for raising the bar for analysis quality and decision-making on our Go-to-Market team. You will provide data-driven insights that help shape GTM strategy across Sales and Marketing and Customer Success.

This is a full-time position offering competitive salary, equity, and benefits. We are a distributed team with offices in San Francisco, New York, and Minneapolis. We're open to hiring fully remote candidates who are currently authorized to work within the United States. We offer flexible remote work options so you can choose the environment that makes you most productive—whether that's your home or a coworking space.

You belong here

We are committed to building an inclusive team and an open-source community where no one feels out of place. We know that teams with diverse backgrounds state their assumptions more explicitly, think more rigorously, and build better software. Plus it's more fun and interesting to work with a wide variety of perspectives.

You should apply to work at Dagster Labs if you want to work in, and help to build and strengthen, a high-performing software development environment where people of all backgrounds are welcome.

We’ve built technology that helps people find great therapists with the first software-enabled national network of providers accepting insurance.

1 in 4 people in the US have a treatable mental health condition, but the majority of providers don’t accept insurance, making therapy too expensive for most people. Headway is building a new mental healthcare system that everyone can access by making it easy for therapists to accept insurance and scale their practice.

Headway was founded in 2019. Since then, we’ve grown into a diverse, national network of over 45,000 mental healthcare providers across all 50 states who run their practice on our software and have served over 1 million patients. We’re a Series D company with over $325m in funding from a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), Accel, GV (formerly Google Ventures), Spark Capital, Thrive Capital, Forerunner Ventures and Health Care Service Corporation.

We want your time here to be the most meaningful experience of your career. Join us, and help change mental healthcare for the better.

About Data At Headway

Building a new mental healthcare system at Headway is only possible because of the insights and leverage that data can provide. The data team at Headway is a small but mighty team designing the infrastructure, implementing pipelines, and driving the analytics and insights to build the mental healthcare system of the future (and have a fun time while doing it!). The data team collaborates deeply with partner teams across the company to identify and drive areas for operational improvement, unlock key insights through infrastructure and data visibility, educate the company on data and how to become more data-driven, and uses technical expertise and science to solve the mental healthcare industry’s most challenging problems.

Snapshot

We’re looking for an applied data analyst to join Google DeepMind’s internal data & analytics group. Working closely with stakeholders, you will provide clarity and structure to ambiguous business problems to guide strategic decisions specifically around our compute and infrastructure strategy, contributing directly to Google DeepMind’s mission of bringing the benefits of AI to the world!

About Us

Artificial Intelligence could be one of humanity’s most useful inventions. At Google DeepMind, we’re a team of scientists, engineers, machine learning experts and more, working together to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence. We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.

You’ll join the Core Analytics Team (CAT) within the Tech Ops & Analytics group at Google DeepMind, comprising a software engineer & data scientists and analysts. We ultimately aim to drive better organisational decisions – blending our technical skillset with rich stakeholder relationships to deliver impact. The outcomes of our work, ranging across topics like (but not limited to!) compute purchase and efficiency, research organisation, and recruitment optimisation, directly influence Google DeepMind’s progress towards our mission.

The role

We’re looking for someone who is skilled at and motivated by helping make sound decisions using quantitative data. This role will specialise in the area of compute management exploring areas like the efficiency of our accelerators and infrastructure.

You’ll bring a particular expertise and perspective around how to most effectively conduct analyses – liaising with engineering colleagues to ensure we collect the right telemetry at source, and working with technical program managers to translate those (and other!) insights into clear decisions both for leadership and process owners.

You’ll also be expected to contribute to our team environment – sharing your knowledge, coaching other analysts, helping articulate and prioritise our common roadmap, and using your experience of analytics in other organisations to make improvements to how we operate.

A core set of the responsibilities this role encompasses:


Work with partners to identify relevant high-level product & business questions and propose appropriate data-focused analysis
Conduct rigorous, verifiable analysis (SQL, Python) to answer those questions
Develop tools (dashboards, reports, web apps) to enable continuous monitoring of key metrics and enable user self-service
Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to analyse large and complex datasets aiming to extract actionable recommendations
Communicate via presentations and written reports to a wide variety of stakeholders (with varying levels of seniority, technical and domain familiarity) – following through to ensure impact
Manage several projects simultaneously, exhibiting good project and time management skills (timelines, expectations, progress, etc.)
Collaborate effectively as part of a team of other data scientists, analysts, engineers and project managers
Recommend changes to product/engineering roadmaps to improve data quality in source systems
Submit tested code into source control for review
Coach and mentor others in their own use of analytical tools and techniques


About You

We're looking for an experienced data analyst with a proven ability to translate complex business challenges into impactful data-driven solutions. You thrive in a fast-paced environment, are comfortable working independently, and excel at communicating insights to diverse audiences.

Key Requirements:


SQL Expertise: You are highly proficient in using SQL to extract, manipulate, and analyze data to solve complex business problems.
Stakeholder Management & Data Storytelling: You have a strong track record of effectively collaborating with and presenting to a variety of stakeholders, including senior leadership.
Fast-Paced Delivery: You are comfortable working in a dynamic environment and consistently meet deadlines while maintaining a high standard of work.
Independent Execution: You are a self-starter who can take ownership of projects and deliver high-quality analysis with minimal supervision.


Additional qualities we value:


Experience with cloud compute metrics, systems, and analytics infrastructure.
An interest in compute and infrastructure efficiency.
Proficiency in Python and the PyData stack (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Jupyter).
A solid understanding of statistical concepts and the ability to apply them in analysis.
A passion for continuous learning and expanding your skill set.
The ability to translate data into meaningful stories and actionable insights.
A collaborative mindset and eagerness to work with others to achieve common goals.


If you don’t think you embody all of the above criteria, please still seriously consider applying! This role (and therefore the requirements) is broad, and we’d be excited to discuss how you see yourself contributing across it.

The US base salary range for this full-time position is between $122,000 - $186,000,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your targeted location during the hiring process.

Note: In the event your application is successful and an offer of employment is made to you, any offer of employment will be conditional on the results of a background check, performed by a third party acting on our behalf.

Automation and strong systems are the lynchpin for enabling scale and driving access for more people to get care.

Proven experience using tools like Mixpanel, Google Analytics 4 (GA4), and Tableau to track and analyze marketing performance.
Experience with marketing funnel analysis, including diagnosing drop-offs, conversion bottlenecks, and optimization strategies to improve efficiency.

Octave's Company Values:

The below values drive our day-to-day operations.


We’re human beings first. We operate with empathy and kindness – with our clients, with our collaborators, and with ourselves.
People deserve better than status quo. We’re willing to tackle the intractable problems, no matter how big, because someone should. We ask big questions, we craft big solutions, and we challenge ourselves and others to make it happen.
No bystanders. No stars. No tourists. Each person has been selected to be here, and with that comes a responsibility to bring your expertise, share your ideas, and help make this company better.
Partnership paves the path ahead. We don’t operate in a silo, internally or externally. To transform the system, we believe in working with others to create something bigger, better, and stronger.
Quality is crucial at scale. Quality is core to our business, and we refuse to sacrifice it as we grow.
Progress is a process. In the pursuit of progress, we iterate, reflect, learn, adjust – and always leave things better than we found them.
There are people behind every data point. We recognize that numbers tell only one part of the story, and we also do the work to understand impacts at the individual level

Must be able to frequently communicate with others through virtual meeting applications such as Zoom and Google Meet.
Must be able to observe and communicate information on company provided laptop.

Current Pay Transparency laws require companies to include a position's salary or hourly wage range (not including bonuses or equity-based compensation) in any internal or external job posting. This requirement extends to job postings published by a third party at an employer's request.

However, employees who have access to the compensation information of other employees or applicants as a part of their essential job functions cannot disclose the pay of other employees or applicants to individuals who do not otherwise have access to compensation information, unless the disclosure is (a) in response to a formal complaint or charge, (b) in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by the employer, or (c) consistent with Octave’s legal duty to furnish information.

Starting pay for qualified applicants will depend on a combination of job-related factors, which may include education, training, experience, location, business needs, or market demands. The expected salary range for this role is set forth below and this range may be modified in the future.

We believe that real estate is one of life’s great adventures. And, as we’ve helped Canadians navigate these uncharted waters, we’ve become the best real estate search platform in the country, and the leading marketplace in BC with an audience twice the size of our nearest rival.

We’ve done this by carefully assembling a team of great people who have great ideas. One of those genius-level ideas is to make REW quite simply the best place in the world to work - and we’d like your help to get there. Yup, really.

And that’s where you come in.

We’re searching for a hugely-motivated Data Analyst to help our Data Engineering Team better understand how our customers use our products, and - more importantly - to translate that understanding into insights that can transform our business.

Rocking the role.

Data is at the heart of everything we do at REW. Every day, our platform ingests feeds from dozens of sources to compile, composite and augment the listings that thousands of homeseekers search through in their quest for the perfect home.

But listings are only part of the puzzle. We also track market behaviour to help inform our own next steps and to empower the agents, landlords, and property developers who count on REW to give them an edge. And while we are awash in all this data, we sometimes risk losing sight of what works and what doesn’t.

That’s where we’d love your help, fellow adventurer.

You’d be joining a small team who are already evolving REW’s data platform, and act as a vital link between our platform and business stakeholders.

With a Great Role comes Great Responsibilities.

Collaborate with product development teams to provide insight to power new features and monitor their performance
Develop reports or data visualization tools for internal use to help support the REW's sales and marketing efforts
Participate in project planning and analysis as needed


Who you are is far more important than where you’ve been.

Qualifications.


Minimum of one year of professional experience with data analysis and big data tech stacks
At least one year of professional experience with Tableau or other data visualization tools such as PowerBI, and/or Google DataStudio
Bachelor of Computer Science, a similar technical degree, or have equivalent experience
Proficiency in SQL and Python (or a similar language for data processing) with exposure to other scripting or object-oriented programming languages
Strong experience in data modelling and quantitative analysis, plus data analysis concepts like data visualization, dashboard design and data mining


Who you are and your life at REW.


You are passionate about personal and professional growth, always seeking new knowledge and innovative technologies

You can maintain a balance between independent work and teamwork, contributing positively to team dynamics and company culture
Analysis is in your DNA, enabling you to craft insightful and maintainable dashboards that tell and compelling story of the data for all stakeholders
You communicate technical designs and concepts with clarity, ensuring alignment and understanding across the team.
You are committed to continuous learning, staying up to date with the company’s products and features to drive and improve performance analytics
You are willing to work primarily in-office at our Vancouver location


What we can offer you.

In addition to competitive compensation, we provide a comprehensive benefits package, the best equipment for you to do your best work, and awesome perks and team events to keep you connected. Annual base salary for this role is $90,000 - $120,000 per year, dependant on experience.

Snapshot

We’re looking for an applied data analyst to join Google DeepMind’s internal data & analytics group. Working closely with stakeholders, you will provide clarity and structure to ambiguous business problems to guide strategic decisions specifically around our compute and infrastructure strategy, contributing directly to Google DeepMind’s mission of bringing the benefits of AI to the world!

About Us

Artificial Intelligence could be one of humanity’s most useful inventions. At Google DeepMind, we’re a team of scientists, engineers, machine learning experts and more, working together to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence. We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.

You’ll join the Core Analytics Team (CAT) within the Tech Ops & Analytics group at Google DeepMind, comprising a software engineer & data scientists and analysts. We ultimately aim to drive better organisational decisions – blending our technical skillset with rich stakeholder relationships to deliver impact. The outcomes of our work, ranging across topics like (but not limited to!) compute purchase and efficiency, research organisation, and recruitment optimisation, directly influence Google DeepMind’s progress towards our mission.

The role

We’re looking for someone who is skilled at and motivated by helping make sound decisions using quantitative data. This role will specialise in the area of compute management exploring areas like the efficiency of our accelerators and infrastructure.

You’ll bring a particular expertise and perspective around how to most effectively conduct analyses – liaising with engineering colleagues to ensure we collect the right telemetry at source, and working with technical program managers to translate those (and other!) insights into clear decisions both for leadership and process owners.

You’ll also be expected to contribute to our team environment – sharing your knowledge, coaching other analysts, helping articulate and prioritise our common roadmap, and using your experience of analytics in other organisations to make improvements to how we operate.

A core set of the responsibilities this role encompasses:


Work with partners to identify relevant high-level product & business questions and propose appropriate data-focused analysis
Conduct rigorous, verifiable analysis (SQL, Python) to answer those questions
Develop tools (dashboards, reports, web apps) to enable continuous monitoring of key metrics and enable user self-service
Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to analyse large and complex datasets aiming to extract actionable recommendations
Communicate via presentations and written reports to a wide variety of stakeholders (with varying levels of seniority, technical and domain familiarity) – following through to ensure impact
Manage several projects simultaneously, exhibiting good project and time management skills (timelines, expectations, progress, etc.)
Collaborate effectively as part of a team of other data scientists, analysts, engineers and project managers
Recommend changes to product/engineering roadmaps to improve data quality in source systems
Submit tested code into source control for review
Coach and mentor others in their own use of analytical tools and techniques


About You

We're looking for an experienced data analyst with a proven ability to translate complex business challenges into impactful data-driven solutions. You thrive in a fast-paced environment, are comfortable working independently, and excel at communicating insights to diverse audiences.

Key Requirements:


SQL Expertise: You are highly proficient in using SQL to extract, manipulate, and analyze data to solve complex business problems.
Stakeholder Management & Data Storytelling: You have a strong track record of effectively collaborating with and presenting to a variety of stakeholders, including senior leadership.
Fast-Paced Delivery: You are comfortable working in a dynamic environment and consistently meet deadlines while maintaining a high standard of work.
Independent Execution: You are a self-starter who can take ownership of projects and deliver high-quality analysis with minimal supervision.


Additional qualities we value:


Experience with cloud compute metrics, systems, and analytics infrastructure.
An interest in compute and infrastructure efficiency.
Proficiency in Python and the PyData stack (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Jupyter).
A solid understanding of statistical concepts and the ability to apply them in analysis.
A passion for continuous learning and expanding your skill set.
The ability to translate data into meaningful stories and actionable insights.
A collaborative mindset and eagerness to work with others to achieve common goals.


If you don’t think you embody all of the above criteria, please still seriously consider applying! This role (and therefore the requirements) is broad, and we’d be excited to discuss how you see yourself contributing across it.

The US base salary range for this full-time position is between $122,000 - $186,000,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your targeted location during the hiring process.

Note: In the event your application is successful and an offer of employment is made to you, any offer of employment will be conditional on the results of a background check, performed by a third party acting on our behalf.

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have an absolute love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem, and living inside a spreadsheet/data set to find the answer to any question.
Because you love data, you have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis. Experience with Marketing APIs, Big Query or other Cloud Data Warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.), ETL Tools (Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics) and/or Python are all pluses.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and have spent a minimum of 1 year working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.




What You’ll Do:

Reporting: With your expertise in Advanced Excel, SQL, Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools, you’ll be maintaining customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence, generating pivot tables and other visualizations that summarize thousands of lines of data. You should have experience in translating performance media metrics into coherent, digestible reports for client ad campaigns and be comfortable communicating via Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.
Strategy: You’ll be responsible for learning our clients’ businesses and aligning their media strategy with business goals as well as understanding advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to help guide media buying strategy. With a background in paid media and/or digital advertising, you understand concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue and are able to be engaged in discussions with clients to gain trust and shareholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.




Gupta Media is an office-first (with flexibility) organization and we are excited to have our team working together again
