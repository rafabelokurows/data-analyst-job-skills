🌎 What we do

We build software that helps companies along the food system get to Net Zero.

~31% of global GHG emissions originate from food-related activities. For the first time in history, climate performance has become an overall business performance indicator. Enterprises are mandated by regulatory bodies to disclose their climate performance, which leads to increasing pressure from investors, competitors, retailers, and consumers to prevent and reduce their CO2e emissions. Over the next 10 years, companies have set ambitious reduction targets that need to be met. Enterprise software and new business processes can help.

We raised >€10m in funding in the first 2 years of our existence, we launched our enterprise product, signed and onboarded some of the largest F&B players in Europe, and put together what we believe is the best-suited early stage tech team in Europe. Will you be the next to join us? 🚀

🔭 What you will work on

Your mission

Help our users make sense of their data and pave the way to Net Zero Emissions.

Over the next 12 months you will:


Create Actionable Insights for Net Zero
Identify data patterns to help users understand and communicate their carbon footprints more effectively to customers and suppliers.
Turn emission data into clear, impactful analytics for users so they can make better decisions.
Bridge data to real-world measures - our users and farmers don’t live in spreadsheets.
Build Prototypes and Products
Develop models and prototypes to help clients set targets and model Net Zero scenarios.
Develop a strong understanding of our users and their unique challenges.
Work closely with the product team to transform prototypes into scalable SaaS products.
Upskill the Team with Data & AI
Stay up-to-date with the latest trends in data analytics and AI product building.
Empower self-service across teams.
Foster a data-first culture in a fast-growing environment where it’s easy to simply listen to your gut feeling.

🚀 You might be really good for this role if


You have a ""get-it-done"" attitude and the ability to learn really fast.
You have built products from scratch in the past, be it on your own or as part of a bigger undertaking inside your company.
You were part of the first 1-50 employees at an early stage technology company, no matter in what position.
You understand and care equally as much about the “why” behind the numbers, you think outcome-first.
You are highly reliable and can organise your work really well.


You don't feel like you fulfil all the criteria? We get it: confidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. But guess what?! There is no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. The only thing you need to ensure along the recruiting process and beyond is that the problem that we are solving with Root is one you cannot wait to get out of bed for on Monday morning! 🤗

🦾 How we support you


You will report to our co-founder Eric


Some of our angel investors that will actively mentor you:

General mentors for product


Vassili Samolis (Director Product @Doordash, ex-Instagram, ex-Pinterest)
Victor Landau (VP Product @cargo.one)


For more technical questions


Pete Hamilton (co-founder & CTO @incident.io)
Tevfik Aloglu (Co-founder @Pyne, ex-BCG DV, ex-Rocket Internet)


For collaboration with design


Jasson Schrock (first designer @Youtube after acquisition, ex-Google, ex-BCG DV)


🎢 Hiring Process

Our ambition is to offer you an end-to-end experience that is fast and uncomplicated - we aim to keep the end-to-end process to 10 working days. We send you prep material for each step and maximise transparency at every step.

Get Mentored By World-class Company Builders

We decided on our cap table with a clear goal in mind: Set our team up for success. This is why we have selected a diverse group of food industry veterans, generalist company builders, and functional experts to join our journey from day 1. Beyond entrusting us with their capital, our angel investors act as mentors and sparring partners for our early team members in their corresponding roles. You will benefit from:


A dedicated mentor with whom you will build your personal relationship
Regular sparring sessions whenever you see fit
Adhoc Q&A where needed

Klar, dass hier auch der Blick über den Tellerrand mit dazu gehört: Was macht der Markt? Wo liegen Trends? Wie können wir neue Ideen daraus entwickeln? Du recherchierst umsichtig, evaluierst gründlich, was zu uns passt, und bringst innovative Lösungen an den Start.
Damit wir Entscheidungen fundiert und zielführend treffen können, entwickelst du smarte Kennzahlensysteme, die genau die Insights liefern, die wir für unsere strategische Weiterentwicklung brauchen.
Und damit das Ganze nicht bloß hintergründige Daten-Theorie bleibt, baust du mit klaren Dashboards und ansprechenden Präsentationen Brücken zur praktischen Anwendung, die bei Stakeholdern und Teams wirklich Eindruck machen und echte Mehrwerte liefern.

Du bringst ein erfolgreich absolviertes Studium der Wirtschaftswissenschaften, (Wirtschafts-)Informatik oder einer MINT-Fachrichtung mit oder hast eine vergleichbare Qualifikation.

Zusätzlich hast du bereits mehrjährige Berufserfahrung als Business / Financial / Data Analyst, als Management Consultant oder im Controlling mit Umsetzungsverantwortung.
Analytisches Denken und Freude an der Erfassung komplexer Prozess- und (Big) Data-Architekturen zeichnen dich aus.
Du hast fundierte Expertise in Reporting-Tools, wie Power BI, MicroStrategy oder Tableau, sowie in der Struktur von Data Warehouses und bringst gute Kenntnisse in SQL und Excel mit.

Bitte beachte, dass wir Unterstützung in unserem Berliner Büro suchen. Die Berechtigung, innerhalb der EU zu arbeiten, ist ebenfalls erforderlich.

Wie wir in deinen Erfolg investieren:

You will be working directly with the senior stakeholders in the firm to understand what insights they are looking to gain, then build reports and dashboards using SQL and PowerBI.




Alongside this, you’ll spend the other half of your time analysing the ESG data and markets, looking for ways you can influence and impact the firm’s performance.




This is a relatively junior role, so while you may have some experience with PowerBI, Tableau or SSRS, this is an opportunity to develop those skills further and progress into a Senior position over the next few years.




The Investment Manager has roughly $110 billion AUM and has been identified as one of the fastest growing globally over the last year – which will provide even more opportunities for progression within the role.

Sylvera provides carbon data for genuine climate impact. Our mission is to incentivize investment in real climate action.

Purchasing credits through the carbon markets is one of the most established and scalable ways to channel finance from the private sector to effective climate solutions and work toward societal net zero. Unfortunately, the voluntary carbon markets have been plagued with mistrust and a lack of effectiveness since they’ve emerged – until Sylvera.

To help organizations ensure they're making the most effective investments, Sylvera builds software that independently and accurately automates the evaluation of carbon projects that capture, remove, or avoid emissions. With Sylvera's data and tools, businesses and governments can confidently invest in, benchmark, deliver, and report real climate impact.

Our team is made up of leading minds in climate change from scientists to policy, finance and carbon market experts. We work in partnership with scientific organisations, universities, governments and think tanks to develop and test rigorous and holistic ratings methodologies, leveraging the latest technology. Founded in 2020, Sylvera has employees worldwide with offices in London, New York, Belgrade and Singapore. We’ve raised over $96million from leading VCs like Balderton Capital, Index Ventures and Insight Partners to date.

About you: 👀

You're passionate about using data to solve complex problems and drive impactful change
You're self-motivated, work independently and take pride in delivering high-quality, impactful analysis
You proactively identify patterns, risks, and opportunities to build scalable, data-driven solutions
You're curious about how things work and how you can improve them
You're a collaborator who can build relationships across multiple teams, in an honest and meaningful way
You're structured and like organisation
You've an excellent work ethic and can manage workloads well
You are able to work effectively within a remote team, it can have its challenges



To be successful in this role, your values matter just as much as skills. Does this sound like you? ✨

🟢We are Kind and Empathetic = Our behaviour and words assume the best in people

🟢We are Always A Team = We are bound together by accountability

🟢We are Curious = A bunch from various backgrounds. We ask questions, plan things out, push the boundaries, challenge the status quo and welcome creativity

🟢We Take Ownership & Deliver = We are focused on our goals and love the details

✅Why work for Vable?


You want ownership of the Data Analytics within Vable
We have a culture that we protect, we value the contributions each Vabler makes
We encourage constant learning so you can keep up to date. A yearly budget of £250 is made available to each Vable employee for continuous learning and development
We encourage creativity and like new ideas and concentrate on the Cultural Add, not fit
We provide comprehensive healthcare cover following probation
You receive a MacBook, monitor and other required technical equipment when you join
33 days of paid leave a year inclusive of statutory holidays, based on where you live
Access to an Employee Assistance Programme through Oliva
We like our virtual socials and really do like to get to know everyone in the team
We are well established; we have been around for 20 years


❌Why it may not be for you:


We are a 40 hour week, Mon-Fri and have core hours, unless stated otherwise or agreed. Being a small remote team, it's how we operate
We have set norms and behaviours and each Vabler is expected to live up to these
While your primary focus will be on data analytics, you'll collaborate with various departments, addressing diverse needs and functions while adapting to shifting priorities. If you prefer a narrowly defined role, this may not be the right fit
We have various meetings per week and people are expected to attend and contribute
Our roles are quite generalist and you will be expected to do areas that you perhaps don't like or feel is not your job. No Vabler has this attitude and we get stuck in and pull our sleeves up. If this isn't you, best not apply.
Everyone has the opportunity to query, ask questions, have new ideas and we will give you our opinion. We operate on continuous feedback and recognition. This isn't for everyone and if this makes you uncomfortable or it's not your thing, this may not be the right fit
We are very transparent and all work is stored on shared drives. Colleagues will give input and it's expected that you will actively adhere to this approach

Simply Business is an online business insurance brokerage that specialises in one thing: protecting the businesses their customers are working hard to build. Since they started life in 2005, they have helped over three million small businesses and self-employed people find the protection that’s right for them, from builders to bakers and personal trainers. Their big idea was to reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible, while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that they believe small businesses and landlords are entitled to.




Their story - continued commitment to doing the right thing




2005 seems like a long time ago. Simply Business – a small company with a big idea. To transform the way that other small businesses could get the insurance that they need. To reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that small businesses are entitled to. To protect them from harm. To keep their livelihoods safe. And to do all this with the promise of positive service. Delivered by happy people, working flexibly, learning constantly. With a restlessly innovative spirit. Within a business committed to doing the right thing. All of the time.




As they've grown, they've tried hard to keep true to this. To ourselves, to their 800 strong team and to the 3.5m customers that they've served so far. And as they move forward, as they enter a big new market, as they grow responsibly, as they improve their products, as they offer their customers more of what they need, of what they deserve, they'll hold onto the focus of that small company with the big idea. Protecting and serving businesses across the UK and the US. From barbers to bakers, consultants to cleaners, they are the backbone of the economy.




And they'll continue to stand by them. Bit by bit helping their dreams grow, just like ours.

Particular focus will be on use cases that will help them drive operational efficiencies as the organization scales.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for fresh graduates who meet the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Enrolled in a quantitative Master’s program (e.g. Business Intelligence Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2024 or spring/summer 2025
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights



Preferred Qualifications


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects
Ability to learn new systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, San Francisco Bay Area, or New York City. We are hiring these positions in Chicago, IL or Toronto, Ontario, Canada.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Present analyses and findings to our partners in a clear and understandable way.
Investigate trends across our EA Sports portfolio, looking for insights and patterns that impact more than one title.

Work experience in an analytics role using data to help guide decisions

Awesome. Something led you here, maybe a glimpse of potential and something amazing? Well that’s how we feel about Klue.

Who are we?

Klue is a VC backed, capital-efficient high growth SaaS company. Tiger Global and Salesforce Ventures led our US$62m Series B in the fall of 2021. We’re creating the category of competitive enablement: helping companies understand their market and outmaneuver their competition. We benefit from having an experienced leadership team working alongside several hundred risk-taking builders who elevate every day.

We’re one of Canada’s Most Admired Corporate Cultures by Waterstone HC, a Deloitte Technology Fast 50 & Fast 500 winner, and recipient of both the Startup of the Year and Tech Culture of the Year awards at the Technology Impact Awards.

The Data Insights' team scope covers data validation for existing sources, outsourced content, and new potential data sources. This role is focused on quality checks at scale and you will be key in ensuring that our data providers and outsourced content creators are delivering high-quality content that is linked back to source data. As the data marketplace is always evolving, you will also be involved in POC's of new data sources that can support manual curation initiatives.

This is You:


Highly analytical and critical thinker
Ability to digest and communicate complex data
You like ambiguity and thrive in fast-paced environments
Your Excel and/or Python skills are top notch
Strong communicator and natural networker
You like to learn new things and are keen to become an expert


Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

Who are we?

Klue is a VC backed, capital-efficient high growth SaaS company. Tiger Global and Salesforce Ventures led our US$62m Series B in the fall of 2021. We’re creating the category of competitive enablement: helping companies understand their market and outmaneuver their competition. We benefit from having an experienced leadership team working alongside several hundred risk-taking builders who elevate every day.

We’re one of Canada’s Most Admired Corporate Cultures by Waterstone HC, a Deloitte Technology Fast 50 & Fast 500 winner, and recipient of both the Startup of the Year and Tech Culture of the Year awards at the Technology Impact Awards.

The Data Insights' team scope covers data validation for existing sources, outsourced content, and new potential data sources. This role is focused on quality checks at scale and you will be key in ensuring that our data providers and outsourced content creators are delivering high-quality content that is linked back to source data. As the data marketplace is always evolving, you will also be involved in POC's of new data sources that can support manual curation initiatives.

This is You:


Highly analytical and critical thinker
Ability to digest and communicate complex data
You like ambiguity and thrive in fast-paced environments
Your Excel and/or Python skills are top notch
Strong communicator and natural networker
You like to learn new things and are keen to become an expert

Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for fresh graduates who meet the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Enrolled in a quantitative Master’s program (e.g. Business Intelligence Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2024 or spring/summer 2025
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights



Preferred Qualifications


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects
Ability to learn new systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, San Francisco Bay Area, or New York City. We are hiring these positions in Chicago, IL or Toronto, Ontario, Canada.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

At the intersection of mind and action, Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) is on a transformative path to become Canada’s leading comprehensive innovation university.

We believe that real estate is one of life’s great adventures. And, as we’ve helped Canadians navigate these uncharted waters, we’ve become the best real estate search platform in the country, and the leading marketplace in BC with an audience twice the size of our nearest rival.

We’ve done this by carefully assembling a team of great people who have great ideas. One of those genius-level ideas is to make REW quite simply the best place in the world to work - and we’d like your help to get there. Yup, really.

And that’s where you come in.

Rocking the role.

Data is at the heart of everything we do at REW. Every day, our platform ingests feeds from dozens of sources to compile, composite and augment the listings that thousands of homeseekers search through in their quest for the perfect home.

But listings are only part of the puzzle. We also track market behaviour to help inform our own next steps and to empower the agents, landlords, and property developers who count on REW to give them an edge. And while we are awash in all this data, we sometimes risk losing sight of what works and what doesn’t.

That’s where we’d love your help, fellow adventurer.

You’d be joining a small team who are already evolving REW’s data platform, and act as a vital link between our platform and business stakeholders.

With a Great Role comes Great Responsibilities.

Collaborate with product development teams to provide insight to power new features and monitor their performance
Develop reports or data visualization tools for internal use to help support the REW's sales and marketing efforts
Participate in project planning and analysis as needed


Who you are is far more important than where you’ve been.

Qualifications.


Minimum of one year of professional experience with data analysis and big data tech stacks
At least one year of professional experience with Tableau or other data visualization tools such as PowerBI, and/or Google DataStudio
Bachelor of Computer Science, a similar technical degree, or have equivalent experience
Proficiency in SQL and Python (or a similar language for data processing) with exposure to other scripting or object-oriented programming languages
Strong experience in data modelling and quantitative analysis, plus data analysis concepts like data visualization, dashboard design and data mining


Who you are and your life at REW.


You are passionate about personal and professional growth, always seeking new knowledge and innovative technologies
You thrive on sharing insights and knowledge with peers to foster a culture of learning and continuous improvement
You can maintain a balance between independent work and teamwork, contributing positively to team dynamics and company culture
Analysis is in your DNA, enabling you to craft insightful and maintainable dashboards that tell and compelling story of the data for all stakeholders
You communicate technical designs and concepts with clarity, ensuring alignment and understanding across the team.
You are committed to continuous learning, staying up to date with the company’s products and features to drive and improve performance analytics
You are willing to work primarily in-office at our Vancouver location


What we can offer you.

In addition to competitive compensation, we provide a comprehensive benefits package, the best equipment for you to do your best work, and awesome perks and team events to keep you connected. Annual base salary for this role is $90,000 - $120,000 per year, dependant on experience.

What You'll Do On Our Team

As a Data Analyst working on the EA Sports Data and Analytics team and reporting to a Director of Analytics, your main focus will be understanding how players engage with EA Sports titles by analyzing their behaviour in-game. You'll not only be interested in exploring and modeling with data but also curious about how our business operates, and the macro environment for EA Sports.

How You’ll Contribute On Our Team


Explore player behavior patterns in our data to identify opportunities to improve the player experience.
Receive business questions from stakeholders, determine the best ways that our data can help answer them, and provide those insights through dashboards, reports, or presentations.
Present analyses and findings to our partners in a clear and understandable way.
Investigate trends across our EA Sports portfolio, looking for insights and patterns that impact more than one title.


What We’re Looking For


Enrolled in a bachelor’s degree granting program in Mathematics, Statistics, Business, Data Science, Computer Science, Analytics, or a related field.
SQL querying skills
Proficient at analyzing datasets in a spreadsheet program (e.g. Excel, Google Sheets) or in a programmatic analysis tool (e.g. Python, R)
Experience with data visualization applications (e.g. Tableau, Power BI, Looker)
Knowledge of statistics (e.g. statistical significance, regression, clustering, predictive modeling)
Work experience in an analytics role using data to help guide decisions
Experience in a consumer products-oriented industry (e.g. gaming, entertainment, e-commerce)
Experience in machine learning or statistical modeling


We are only considering students who will be enrolled in an accredited degree program in the summer of 2025, slated to graduate no earlier than December 2025. Applicants must be legally authorized to work in Canada on a full-time basis during the 16-week internship. Visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS The base salary ranges listed below are for the defined geographic market pay zones in these states. If you reside outside of these locations, a recruiter will advise on the base salary range and benefits for your specific location. EA has listed the hourly pay ranges it in good faith expects to pay applicants for this role in the locations listed, as of the time of this posting. Salary offered will be determined based on numerous relevant business and candidate factors including, for example, degree type (e.g. Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD), what stage you are in your degree journey (i.e. freshman, sophomore, etc.), qualifications, certifications, experience, skills, geographic location, and business or organizational needs. PAY RANGES


British Columbia (depending on location e.g. Vancouver vs. Victoria)
$60,000 - $65,000 CAD

The hourly pay is just one part of the overall compensation at EA. We also offer a package of benefits including 80 hours per year of sick time (prorated based on scheduled hours per week if less than full-time), 16 paid company holidays per year, medical insurance, and 401(k).

Awesome. Something led you here, maybe a glimpse of potential and something amazing? Well that’s how we feel about Klue.

Who are we?

Klue is a VC backed, capital-efficient high growth SaaS company. Tiger Global and Salesforce Ventures led our US$62m Series B in the fall of 2021. We’re creating the category of competitive enablement: helping companies understand their market and outmaneuver their competition. We benefit from having an experienced leadership team working alongside several hundred risk-taking builders who elevate every day.

We’re one of Canada’s Most Admired Corporate Cultures by Waterstone HC, a Deloitte Technology Fast 50 & Fast 500 winner, and recipient of both the Startup of the Year and Tech Culture of the Year awards at the Technology Impact Awards.

The Data Insights' team scope covers data validation for existing sources, outsourced content, and new potential data sources. This role is focused on quality checks at scale and you will be key in ensuring that our data providers and outsourced content creators are delivering high-quality content that is linked back to source data. As the data marketplace is always evolving, you will also be involved in POC's of new data sources that can support manual curation initiatives.

This is You:


Highly analytical and critical thinker
Ability to digest and communicate complex data
You like ambiguity and thrive in fast-paced environments
Your Excel and/or Python skills are top notch
Strong communicator and natural networker
You like to learn new things and are keen to become an expert


Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

DarkVision uses state-of-the-art proprietary acoustic imaging technologies to provide asset inspection services to industrial clients. This ultrasound system gathers immense datasets and identifies defects as small as a few millimeters. Automated processing, measurement, classification, and visualization algorithms are crucial due to the time-consuming and inconsistent nature of manual processing.




In this role, you will interpret ultrasound data obtained from DarkVision’s Pipeline Inline-Inspection (ILI) tool to produce accurate and reliable inspection reports, essential for the safe operation of oil and gas pipelines. You will be responsible for identifying and annotating features within ultrasound imaging data, creating visualizations, and generating client reports.

Our Team

Our Data Analysts utilize 3D data visualization software and human-in-the-loop machine learning processes to meticulously analyze ultrasound datasets. The outputs of these analyses result in critical insights that enable our clients to make data-informed decisions on the operations and maintenance of multi-million-dollar energy infrastructure assets.

Inspect ultrasound data to identify and annotate features and defects.
Create 3D visualizations and renderings from raw ultrasound data.
Generate and edit detailed reports for client delivery.
Help define processes and training for the ILI data analysis team.




Opportunities To Learn and Work On:

Contribute to process automation and client reporting.
Become a Subject Matter Expert (SME) in pipeline Non-Destructive Evaluation/Testing (NDE/NDT) integrity inspection.




Who You Are (Basic Qualifications)

Experience in at least one of:
Ultrasound- or acoustics-based asset integrity data management or analysis.
Pipeline inspection services and data analysis.
Upstream oil and gas production or processing.
Experience in quality control processes and preparing client-facing reports.




What Will Put You Ahead

Professional experience programming in Python.
Experience in developing analyses, code, and dashboards to automate and enhance processes in an industry application.
Experience in ILI or NDE/NDT
Experience in the Oil & Gas industry
Experience gathering, evaluating, and investigating image/computer vision data
Experience working with spatial or GIS data
Demonstrated ability as a self-starter and independent contributor, adept at efficiently and proactively managing new tasks.




General Salary Range

For this role, we anticipate paying $30 to 38 per hour. This role is eligible for variable pay, issued as a monetary bonus or in another form.




At Koch companies, we are entrepreneurs. This means we openly challenge the status quo, find new ways to create value and get rewarded for our individual contributions. Any compensation range provided for a role is an estimate determined by available market data. The actual amount may be higher or lower than the range provided considering each candidate's knowledge, skills, abilities, and geographic location. If you have questions, please speak to your recruiter about the flexibility and detail of our compensation philosophy.




Who We Are

DarkVision Technologies Inc. is a Canada-based tech company disrupting the industrial imaging market since 2013. We have created the world’s most advanced acoustic-based imaging platform.

Additionally, everyone has individual work and personal needs. We seek to enable the best work environment that helps you and the business work together to produce superior results.
