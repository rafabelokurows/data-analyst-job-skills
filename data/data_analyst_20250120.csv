ThirdLove disrupted the lingerie industry by empowering women to find their perfect fit online with our innovative Fitting Room® quiz and is one of the original brands to operate 100% direct-to-consumer. All design and R&D is done in-house, and our extensive and complex supply chain is fully managed by our team. Inclusivity is at the core of who we are and how we serve our customers and build our teams.

Traditionally, women were given a choice between two options when it came to their bras and underwear: Be sexy, or be comfortable. Our Cofounders: Dave Spector, Heidi Zak, and Ra’el Cohen, thought that was outdated too — so, in 2013, they created ThirdLove — a third, better option, which doesn’t force us to choose between being sexy or comfortable.

What Our Team Embodies

Our culture is collaborative, fast-paced, and data-driven, and we were most recently recognized with the Great Place to Work certification. This recognition is given to a very small percentage of companies who apply for it and determined by employees’ real-time reports of their company culture.

Strong proficiency in R or Python, with mentoring capability, and strong experience with data visualization platforms such as Looker or Tableau.
Proven ability to leverage data for business impact, with a focus on organic growth analytics (SEO, content marketing, incentive-driven growth) within consumer-facing digital environments.

We are excited to hire a lead analyst focused on enrollment and conversion at Chime. In this role, you will work with both marketers and product managers to understand and improve our user journeys.

You will analyze large datasets to find usage patterns that indicate opportunities and then communicate your findings to our partners in marketing, product management, engineering, design, and user research. You’ll work closely with marketing teams to enable data-driven decision making both within and between marketing channels.

Foster a data-driven, test-and-learn culture with your passion for telling stories with data - not only surfacing insights, but also presenting those insights and recommendations to a variety of levels within the organization, including executives, to influence change.
Be obsessed with causation, attribution and incremental lift - measuring the marginal benefit against marginal cost of our marketing or product efforts.
Identify what KPIs, data, features and events will show whether success has been achieved, where it has been achieved, and why.
Deep-dive into existing marketing campaigns to identify areas of opportunity for scale and efficiency
Lead, mentor, and collaborate with other analytics team members to build, standardize, improve, and drive adoption of analytical processes
Discuss and develop attribution methodologies, measurement tactics, and spend optimization strategies in order to drive meaningful impact to our user growth and bottom line.


To thrive in this role, you have


An advanced degree, or equivalent working experience, in Statistics, Econometrics, Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related quantitative field.
7+ years of experience in B2C analytics (marketing analytics experience a plus).
Advanced SQL and data visualization skills (Looker or Tableau)
Experience with Python or R for analysis and workflow automation
Excellent communication and data storytelling skills and ability to work cross-functionally to achieve results in a fast-paced environment
Proven ability to apply experimentation / AB testing, statistical analysis, and other data science techniques to understand how your organization can optimize marketing and/or product efforts

Strong proficiency in R or Python, with mentoring capability, and strong experience with data visualization platforms such as Looker or Tableau.
Proven ability to leverage data for business impact, with a focus on organic growth analytics (SEO, content marketing, incentive-driven growth) within consumer-facing digital environments.

We believe that real estate is one of life’s great adventures. And, as we’ve helped Canadians navigate these uncharted waters, we’ve become the best real estate search platform in the country, and the leading marketplace in BC with an audience twice the size of our nearest rival.

We’ve done this by carefully assembling a team of great people who have great ideas. One of those genius-level ideas is to make REW quite simply the best place in the world to work - and we’d like your help to get there. Yup, really.

And that’s where you come in.

We’re searching for a hugely-motivated Data Analyst to help our Data Engineering Team better understand how our customers use our products, and - more importantly - to translate that understanding into insights that can transform our business.

Rocking the role.

Data is at the heart of everything we do at REW. Every day, our platform ingests feeds from dozens of sources to compile, composite and augment the listings that thousands of homeseekers search through in their quest for the perfect home.

But listings are only part of the puzzle. We also track market behaviour to help inform our own next steps and to empower the agents, landlords, and property developers who count on REW to give them an edge. And while we are awash in all this data, we sometimes risk losing sight of what works and what doesn’t.

That’s where we’d love your help, fellow adventurer.

You’d be joining a small team who are already evolving REW’s data platform, and act as a vital link between our platform and business stakeholders.

With a Great Role comes Great Responsibilities.

Data processing and modeling to derive business insights using a variety of quantitative analytical techniques
Collaborate with product development teams to provide insight to power new features and monitor their performance
Develop reports or data visualization tools for internal use to help support the REW's sales and marketing efforts
Participate in project planning and analysis as needed


Who you are is far more important than where you’ve been.

Qualifications.


Minimum of one year of professional experience with data analysis and big data tech stacks
At least one year of professional experience with Tableau or other data visualization tools such as PowerBI, and/or Google DataStudio
Bachelor of Computer Science, a similar technical degree, or have equivalent experience
Proficiency in SQL and Python (or a similar language for data processing) with exposure to other scripting or object-oriented programming languages
Strong experience in data modelling and quantitative analysis, plus data analysis concepts like data visualization, dashboard design and data mining


Who you are and your life at REW.


You are passionate about personal and professional growth, always seeking new knowledge and innovative technologies
You thrive on sharing insights and knowledge with peers to foster a culture of learning and continuous improvement
You can maintain a balance between independent work and teamwork, contributing positively to team dynamics and company culture
Analysis is in your DNA, enabling you to craft insightful and maintainable dashboards that tell and compelling story of the data for all stakeholders
You communicate technical designs and concepts with clarity, ensuring alignment and understanding across the team.
You are committed to continuous learning, staying up to date with the company’s products and features to drive and improve performance analytics
You are willing to work primarily in-office at our Vancouver location


What we can offer you.

In addition to competitive compensation, we provide a comprehensive benefits package, the best equipment for you to do your best work, and awesome perks and team events to keep you connected. Annual base salary for this role is $90,000 - $120,000 per year, dependant on experience.

We believe that real estate is one of life’s great adventures. And, as we’ve helped Canadians navigate these uncharted waters, we’ve become the best real estate search platform in the country, and the leading marketplace in BC with an audience twice the size of our nearest rival.

We’ve done this by carefully assembling a team of great people who have great ideas. One of those genius-level ideas is to make REW quite simply the best place in the world to work - and we’d like your help to get there. Yup, really.

And that’s where you come in.

We’re searching for a hugely-motivated Data Analyst to help our Data Engineering Team better understand how our customers use our products, and - more importantly - to translate that understanding into insights that can transform our business.

Rocking the role.

Data is at the heart of everything we do at REW. Every day, our platform ingests feeds from dozens of sources to compile, composite and augment the listings that thousands of homeseekers search through in their quest for the perfect home.

But listings are only part of the puzzle. We also track market behaviour to help inform our own next steps and to empower the agents, landlords, and property developers who count on REW to give them an edge. And while we are awash in all this data, we sometimes risk losing sight of what works and what doesn’t.

That’s where we’d love your help, fellow adventurer.

You’d be joining a small team who are already evolving REW’s data platform, and act as a vital link between our platform and business stakeholders.

With a Great Role comes Great Responsibilities.

Collaborate with product development teams to provide insight to power new features and monitor their performance

Strong experience in data modelling and quantitative analysis, plus data analysis concepts like data visualization, dashboard design and data mining

You can maintain a balance between independent work and teamwork, contributing positively to team dynamics and company culture
Analysis is in your DNA, enabling you to craft insightful and maintainable dashboards that tell and compelling story of the data for all stakeholders
You communicate technical designs and concepts with clarity, ensuring alignment and understanding across the team.
You are committed to continuous learning, staying up to date with the company’s products and features to drive and improve performance analytics
You are willing to work primarily in-office at our Vancouver location


What we can offer you.

In addition to competitive compensation, we provide a comprehensive benefits package, the best equipment for you to do your best work, and awesome perks and team events to keep you connected. Annual base salary for this role is $90,000 - $120,000 per year, dependant on experience.

La Direction BtoC a pour ambition de développer la plateforme de streaming gratuite leader sur le divertissement familial et l’information pour les francophones.

Cette nouvelle ambition, stratégique pour le Groupe, implique de passer sur l’ensemble des sujets d’un service de rattrapage à une plateforme de streaming / destination. Notre offre est amenée à profondément évoluer que ce soit le produit, l’infrastructure tech, le marketing digital (acquisition et engagement des utilisateurs dans tous les environnements OTT, FAI, TV connectées), le marketing éditorial, les formats publicitaires ainsi que notre organisation et les profils de l’équipe.

Sur le plan digital, TF1+ s’établit comme leader en couverture avec 33 millions de streamers mensuels en moyenne au premier trimestre, et 35,4 millions en mai, un nouveau record, en comparaison des 28 millions de streamers mensuels pour MYTF1 en 2023. Au premier trimestre 2024, la plateforme enregistre 285 millions d’heures streamées (+13% par rapport au premier trimestre 2023) selon Médiamétrie, qui intègre les environnements où subsiste MYTF1, tant que TF1+ n’y est pas encore distribué. Sur les environnements où la nouvelle plateforme est disponible, la consommation est en forte progression de 79%.

Nous recherchons un Data Analyst Growth et Monétisation en CDI pour intervenir sur les sujets liés à l’enrichissement du catalogue de la plateforme de streaming TF1+

Rejoindre le Groupe TF1




C’est prendre part à des projets ambitieux au cœur de la roadmap stratégique du premier groupe audiovisuel privé, leader de la télévision en France avec 5 chaines gratuites et 3 chaines thématiques sur la télévision payante (TF1, TMC, TMX, TF1 SERIES FILMS, LCI, TV BREIZH, HISTOIRE, USHUAIA TV), ainsi que des services de médias audiovisuels à la demande (TF1+, TFOU MAX…) pour en faire la destination de référence pour le divertissement et l’info en France.




C’est faire partie d’un Groupe de l'événement, des émotions et du direct. TF1 propose une programmation diverse et familiale dans les domaines de l’information, du divertissement, de la fiction, du cinéma et des documentaires.




C’est également travailler à la production et la distribution de contenus, notamment via les filiales du Groupe TF1 PRODUCTION, TF1 FILMS PRODUCTION et NEWEN.




C’est enfin réaliser des projets qui se voient, et qui impactent directement la vie de millions de personnes, au sein d’une entreprise consciente de sa responsabilité sociétale et environnementale. En effet, le groupe TF1 s’engage pour participer à la construction d’une société plus solidaire, plus inclusive et plus durable.




Sur le plan social, le Groupe agit activement en faveur de l’égalité femme-homme, au sein des équipes comme sur les plateaux télévisés. Il promeut également la diversité et l’inclusion dans le recrutement, le management des talents, mais aussi sur l’ensemble de ses chaînes.

Sur le plan environnemental, le Groupe est engagé dans une trajectoire de décarbonation avec des objectifs validés par le SBTi, et tâche de favoriser la publicité responsable, mais aussi de sensibiliser ses publics à la transition écologique, tant au travers de ses programmes d’information que des fictions ou séries quotidiennes.




A la clé




Un environnement de travail et une culture d’entreprise permettant à tous les profils de s’épanouir au quotidien.

Des espaces qui allient confort et praticité

95% des collaborateurs jugent l’aménagement des locaux pleinement satisfaisant 👍 (enquête interne 2022), et 81% pensent que nos espaces en flex-office favorisent une bonne ambiance
Espaces flex, terrasses végétalisées ou télétravail : c’est à la carte.
Sur place ou à emporter : des repas healthy, variés et subventionnés au restaurant d’entreprise ou à la cafétéria, mais aussi le plein de services trop pratiques (parking, atelier réparation vélo, permanence mutuelle, opticien…)

Une culture all-inclusive

56% de femmes dans le Groupe, 30% dans les équipes Tech, et une envie forte d’aller encore plus loin
Une Mission Handicap qui agit chaque jour pour garantir le respect de la singularité de chacun en proposant un accompagnement sur mesure aux collaborateurs concernés par un handicap, ainsi qu’à leur manager !

Training

Pour le corps, grâce à nos 17 associations sportives (football, volleyball, krav maga, running, etc.), et notre salle de sport subventionnée à moins de 100 mètres
Pour l’esprit, avec des formations pour se mettre à jour en permanence (75% des collaborateurs formés en 2023), et un accompagnement de carrière sur-mesure

+1 👶

Le Groupe TF1 propose à l’ensemble des collaborateurs une flexibilité en matière d’organisation du temps de travail avant le congé maternité, et un suivi professionnel au retour
Le salaire est maintenu à 100% pour les collaborateurs concernés par la prise totale ou partielle d’un congé paternité / second parent, et ce, durant 28 jours
Une prise en charge partielle des modes de garde est proposée

Et parce que le nombre de caractères est limité, on sera ravis de vous présenter les différents plans d’épargne entreprise, les congés spéciaux, la mutuelle d’entreprise, les forfaits mobilité ou encore le CSE lors de notre prochain échange !

La Direction BtoC a pour ambition de développer la plateforme de streaming gratuite leader sur le divertissement familial et l’information pour les francophones.

Cette nouvelle ambition, stratégique pour le Groupe, implique de passer sur l’ensemble des sujets d’un service de rattrapage à une plateforme de streaming / destination. Notre offre est amenée à profondément évoluer que ce soit le produit, l’infrastructure tech, le marketing digital (acquisition et engagement des utilisateurs dans tous les environnements OTT, FAI, TV connectées), le marketing éditorial, les formats publicitaires ainsi que notre organisation et les profils de l’équipe.

Sur le plan digital, TF1+ s’établit comme leader en couverture avec 33 millions de streamers mensuels en moyenne au premier trimestre, et 35,4 millions en mai, un nouveau record, en comparaison des 28 millions de streamers mensuels pour MYTF1 en 2023. Au premier trimestre 2024, la plateforme enregistre 285 millions d’heures streamées (+13% par rapport au premier trimestre 2023) selon Médiamétrie, qui intègre les environnements où subsiste MYTF1, tant que TF1+ n’y est pas encore distribué. Sur les environnements où la nouvelle plateforme est disponible, la consommation est en forte progression de 79%.

Nous recherchons un Data Analyst Growth et Monétisation en CDI pour intervenir sur les sujets liés à l’enrichissement du catalogue de la plateforme de streaming TF1+

C’est prendre part à des projets ambitieux au cœur de la roadmap stratégique du premier groupe audiovisuel privé, leader de la télévision en France avec 5 chaines gratuites et 3 chaines thématiques sur la télévision payante (TF1, TMC, TMX, TF1 SERIES FILMS, LCI, TV BREIZH, HISTOIRE, USHUAIA TV), ainsi que des services de médias audiovisuels à la demande (TF1+, TFOU MAX…) pour en faire la destination de référence pour le divertissement et l’info en France.




C’est faire partie d’un Groupe de l'événement, des émotions et du direct. TF1 propose une programmation diverse et familiale dans les domaines de l’information, du divertissement, de la fiction, du cinéma et des documentaires.




C’est également travailler à la production et la distribution de contenus, notamment via les filiales du Groupe TF1 PRODUCTION, TF1 FILMS PRODUCTION et NEWEN.




C’est enfin réaliser des projets qui se voient, et qui impactent directement la vie de millions de personnes, au sein d’une entreprise consciente de sa responsabilité sociétale et environnementale. En effet, le groupe TF1 s’engage pour participer à la construction d’une société plus solidaire, plus inclusive et plus durable.




Sur le plan social, le Groupe agit activement en faveur de l’égalité femme-homme, au sein des équipes comme sur les plateaux télévisés. Il promeut également la diversité et l’inclusion dans le recrutement, le management des talents, mais aussi sur l’ensemble de ses chaînes.

Sur le plan environnemental, le Groupe est engagé dans une trajectoire de décarbonation avec des objectifs validés par le SBTi, et tâche de favoriser la publicité responsable, mais aussi de sensibiliser ses publics à la transition écologique, tant au travers de ses programmes d’information que des fictions ou séries quotidiennes.




A la clé




Un environnement de travail et une culture d’entreprise permettant à tous les profils de s’épanouir au quotidien.

Des espaces qui allient confort et praticité

95% des collaborateurs jugent l’aménagement des locaux pleinement satisfaisant 👍 (enquête interne 2022), et 81% pensent que nos espaces en flex-office favorisent une bonne ambiance
Espaces flex, terrasses végétalisées ou télétravail : c’est à la carte.
Sur place ou à emporter : des repas healthy, variés et subventionnés au restaurant d’entreprise ou à la cafétéria, mais aussi le plein de services trop pratiques (parking, atelier réparation vélo, permanence mutuelle, opticien…)

Une culture all-inclusive

56% de femmes dans le Groupe, 30% dans les équipes Tech, et une envie forte d’aller encore plus loin
Une Mission Handicap qui agit chaque jour pour garantir le respect de la singularité de chacun en proposant un accompagnement sur mesure aux collaborateurs concernés par un handicap, ainsi qu’à leur manager !

Training

Pour le corps, grâce à nos 17 associations sportives (football, volleyball, krav maga, running, etc.), et notre salle de sport subventionnée à moins de 100 mètres
Pour l’esprit, avec des formations pour se mettre à jour en permanence (75% des collaborateurs formés en 2023), et un accompagnement de carrière sur-mesure

+1 👶

Le Groupe TF1 propose à l’ensemble des collaborateurs une flexibilité en matière d’organisation du temps de travail avant le congé maternité, et un suivi professionnel au retour
Le salaire est maintenu à 100% pour les collaborateurs concernés par la prise totale ou partielle d’un congé paternité / second parent, et ce, durant 28 jours
Une prise en charge partielle des modes de garde est proposée

Et parce que le nombre de caractères est limité, on sera ravis de vous présenter les différents plans d’épargne entreprise, les congés spéciaux, la mutuelle d’entreprise, les forfaits mobilité ou encore le CSE lors de notre prochain échange !

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have an absolute love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem, and living inside a spreadsheet/data set to find the answer to any question.
Because you love data, you have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis. Experience with Marketing APIs, Big Query or other Cloud Data Warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.), ETL Tools (Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics) and/or Python are all pluses.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and have spent a minimum of 1 year working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.




What You’ll Do:

Reporting: With your expertise in Advanced Excel, SQL, Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools, you’ll be maintaining customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence, generating pivot tables and other visualizations that summarize thousands of lines of data. You should have experience in translating performance media metrics into coherent, digestible reports for client ad campaigns and be comfortable communicating via Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.
Strategy: You’ll be responsible for learning our clients’ businesses and aligning their media strategy with business goals as well as understanding advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to help guide media buying strategy. With a background in paid media and/or digital advertising, you understand concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue and are able to be engaged in discussions with clients to gain trust and shareholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.




Gupta Media is an office-first (with flexibility) organization and we are excited to have our team working together again

We don't just want you to work here. We want you to grow and thrive here.

We're embracing a hybrid work model that enables our teams to split their time between office and home.

Collaborate cross-functionally to ensure data quality and relevance, making insights actionable for both technical and non-technical team

A collaborative mindset and problem-solving skills, with the ability to turn data insights into actionable recommendations.

We are currently looking for people to participate in our Menu Photo Collection project Finch.




What is the project about?

This project collects photos, live photos and short videos of menus (takeout menus, menus at restaurants, menus at boards, etc.). The photos collected will be used to support the development of technological products and services, including photo/video recognition services and artificial intelligence features.




This project can be a lot of fun! You can check your cabinets at home for takeaway menus, pick paper menus from your grocery store, go to a restaurant and check the dessert menu (even if you do not have a sweet tooth!), walk down the street and have a look at the chalkboard or the menu hanging at the door of an eatery. You can explore the almost unlimited variety of menus out there, dedicate a few minutes photographing them, and earn money you can spend on anything, even perhaps your next meal out!




Who is eligible?

To participate you should meet the following qualifying criteria:

Be 18 years or older.
Residing in the USA
Have an iPhone with iOS 17 or later with a functional camera.




Where is the project taking place?

This is a fully remote project. Note: all the photos should be taken within the USA.




How much is the compensation?

$0.80 USD per menu. For each menu you will need to take 2 photos. Due to the nature of the project, you will be able to participate many times with a variety of menus easy to obtain!




As payment method, we offer PayPal, Gift Card, Check and Wire Transfer according to your preference.




Please note that our Quality Assurance team will review all submissions to ensure they meet the project specific requirements. The project team will provide you with feedback once the Quality Check process is completed.
