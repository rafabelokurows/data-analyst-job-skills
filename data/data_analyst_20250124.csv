Als Data Analist maak je deel uit van het team Market Intelligence samen met 14 andere collega’s.

Samen zorg je ervoor dat zowel senior management als ‘mensen op de vloer’ aan de slag kunnen met data. De scope is hierbij groot en we pionieren dan ook continu naar nieuwe mogelijkheden voor betere besluitvorming. Je kunt hierbij denken aan dashboarding, strategische analyses, voorspelmodellen, onderzoek, simulaties en meer.

Je stelt je op als kwantitatief expert en bent daarmee medeverantwoordelijk voor de dashboarding vanuit het team.
Je bent in staat jouw dashboards en analyses op een aantrekkelijke en doortastende manier te presenteren. Het is voor de gebruiker leuk en prikkelend om verder aan de slag te gaan met het werk dat je oplevert.

Bol continuously advances its platform to create a better tomorrow for over 13 million customers and over 50,000 trading partners. Our Advertising via bol (Avb) propositions, which help shoppers discover products and help advertisers reach shoppers, play an important role in bol’s ambitions – and this is where you’ll make the difference. As Avb Marketing, we help and engage thousands of our advertisers.

Marketing Analytics play an instrumental role here. Our goal is to enable ‘Engagement at Scale’. As a Marketing Data Analyst, you’ll analyze our advertising partners’ behavior, uncover opportunities for improvement and share actionable insights with our marketeers so that our campaigns reach the right audience at the right time. In all your decisions, you’ll take scalability into account as we serve thousands of active advertisers at any given moment.

The biggest challenge

Advertising via Bol is growing fast and becoming increasingly important for bol. The number of colleagues, the complexity of the tech, and the breadth of initiatives are rapidly expanding. Data needs and requests for more insights are no exception. At the same time, we’re implementing Marketing Automation tools to improve our capabilities. This requires us to work pragmatically and focus on achieving the required outcomes. You rise to the occasion to ensure that the underlying data of our campaigns is robust, can be used effectively and responsibly and iterate quickly.

What You’ll Do As An Marketing Data Analyst

You’ll join a team of marketing data analysts in bol’s Avb Marketing Analytics team, which aims to help the marketing teams to create more engaging and impactful campaigns through data.

Your Workload Covers Three Main Areas


You help our marketeers by creating insights to understand advertiser behavior, help optimize campaigns, and drive data-driven decisions. All with the goal of building and optimizing campaigns that help and engage advertisers
You help build, maintain and simplify our data model that supports our communication flows. All with the goal of enabling scalable campaigning where we reach thousands of advertisers at a relevant moment
You analyze the performance of our campaigns and attribute their commercial value. All with the goal of identifying opportunities for improvement and getting a clear picture of the impact we’re making as a department


We’re Looking For You If You


Don’t want to work alone. You work closely with various stakeholders to make the above possible. This requires strong communication skills to bridge the gap between Marketeers, Analysts and Product Engineers;
Challenge ideas. You help the team with the other Marketing data analysts to reach a higher level, both in terms of content and on a personal level.
Help implement best practice around tools and concepts like: Git, SQL, Dbt, data testing, monitoring, and alerting, to create a state-of-the-art analytics environment that enforces quality standards;
Help model pipelines, optimize queries, and apply best practices. You also actively collaborate within bol’s wider analytics engineering and data engineering community to improve our data stack at scale;
Practice and preach Clean Code principles such as DRY and Clean, Clear and Concise;
Know a thing or two about data engineering, analytics engineering or business intelligence engineering and know your way around a marketing automation tooling (such as Marigold Engage).


3 reasons why this is (not) for you Switch to find out


Uncomfortable with ambiguity Our data landscape evolves, and you’ll need to navigate it confidently, so an entrepreneurial mindset is a must. Bol is complex, you have to involve and convince both Product & Tech colleagues to find solutions, proactively and autonomously.
Output over outcome If your work ends when you complete a dashboard – who cares how users experience it – then this job is not for you. We’re looking to find real solutions for our marketing teams to build solid campaigns!
No continuous improvement We’re always learning from our analyses and work to improve our ways-of-working.
Sharing is caring You have hands-on experience in marketing analytics, SQL (e.g. BigQuery), statistics (the basics) and feel comfortable navigating and analyzing large, complex datasets.
High quality code results in clear and actionable insights Finetuning queries, data models, and coding principles make you smile and SQL, Git and dashboarding tools like Tableau/Looker Studio are your home away from home. *Dbt and/or Airflow is a plus.
You are not a one-trick-pony Our role is multi-faceted so you can translate data to opportunity and opportunity to campaign building blocks. It starts with extracting campaign opportunities from data and ends with realizing the data foundation for scalable marketing campaigns.


This is where you’ll work

You’ll join a team of four Marketing Data Analysts which supports our multidisciplinary Avb Marketing team. Your marketing colleagues are seasoned in the world of data and CRM. Sparring happens on a daily basis. We like to make each other better – motivating and respecting are second nature to us.

Besides the strategic topics, you have the space to work on your own innovations and seize the opportunities you identify. Bol gladly invests in your personal and professional growth; development is a primary employment condition. The culture is informal, down-to-earth, and pioneering.

We work in collaborative spaces where you’ll work alongside other data enthusiasts, enjoying a mix of open areas and quiet corners. Our most important stakeholders in Marketing, Sales and Product are just a stroll away.

It is our responsibility to enable an environment that unleashes the power of diversity.

For our clients, we design and coordinate drug development programs, for both chemical entities and biologics. One of our core activities is the pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetic (TK) evaluation of new products.




DGr Pharma has currently an open position for a PK/TK data analyst with relevant SAS experience.




As PK/TK data analyst you will perform Phoenix WinNonlin parameter calculations to support nonclinical TK studies or clinical phase I/II and typical pharmacology/PK interaction studies. In your role you will typically perform:

Preliminary and final PK/TK non-compartmental analysis in line with the applicable OECD-GLP or ICH-GCP guidelines, relevant SOPs, working instructions and procedures including sponsor specific requirements.
Write PK analysis plans and reports.
Generate supporting tables and figures by means of SAS and/or Excel or other specific software.
Generate datasets containing the derived PK/TK results in line with SEND or CDISC standards.




DGr Pharma, located in Breda, The Netherlands, was founded in November 2018. The current staff of 13 people represent a track record built over 25 years in early phase drug development with a focus on PK, clinical pharmacology, nonclinical, chemistry manufacturing and control (CMC), regulatory affairs and IT support. Along with the PK expertise, DGr Pharma also provides the service of noncompartmental analyses performed with Phoenix WinNonlin.




If you are interested in drug development and more specifically in TK and PK, willing to work in a dynamic, flexible and growing business, have a high affinity for numbers with proficiency in the usage or SAS and/or Phoenix WinNonlin; if you are result driven and able to multi-task, able to manage workload and meet strict deadlines/timelines with strong costumer skills, the role of PK/TK data analyst at DGr Pharma might be something for you. For this current position, a background in working in a GLP/GCP environment is a pre. Growth to a consultancy position is an option.




The contract appointment is offered for 40 hours per week (minimum 24 hours) in a partly flexible construction. Initially, a one-year contract will be offered with the option of a permanent contract extension. DGr Pharma offers excellent primary and secondary conditions.




Acquisition as a result of this vacancy is not appreciated.

Je gaat aan de slag met het omtoveren van data naar informatie. Hierbij maak je gebruik van analysetechnieken en je eigen kennis en kunde. Door jouw sociale vaardigheden begrijp je de context en de daaruit voortkomende vraag naar informatie van je collega. Je weet deze vraag door je technische vaardigheden te relateren aan de techniek om de gevraagde informatie beschikbaar te krijgen. Je zet hier databases voor op en ontwikkelt informatieproducten zoals dashboards inclusief het modelleren en visualiseren van de data.




Soms is de data nog niet beschikbaar. Je houdt je daarom ook bezig met het automatiseren van

bedrijfsprocessen en het meedenken over welke tooling en technieken van toegevoegde waarde

zijn om efficiënt en effectief van data informatie te maken. Niet enkel stel je informatie beschikbaar, je zorgt er ook voor dat deze informatie betrouwbaar is én ook van waarde is voor onze directe klant. Dit kan betekenen dat je gebruikers van informatie bijbrengt wat informatie-gestuurd werken is, hoe de gebruiker dit in zijn/haar context kan toepassen, door blijft vragen tot een duidelijke schets van het “probleem”, je analyses verricht die leiden tot inzichten, je adviseert over welke technische aspecten dienen te veranderen om mee te gaan in de ontwikkeling van analytics en meer!




Wat onze opdrachtgever van je verwacht

Bij onze opdrachtgever krijg je veel ruimte om jezelf te ontwikkelen. Wel is het fijn als je in ieder geval:

Beschikt over HBO werk- en denkniveau;
Ervaring hebt met het ontwikkelen en beheren van informatieproducten, bij voorkeur PowerBI (informatietaxonomie, modellering en visualisatie);
Ervaring hebt met en kennis van programmeren, zoals SQL, Python en R;
Kennis hebt van het optimaliseren van data processen en alle bijbehorende rapportages
en data analyses;
Een actieve bijdrage kunt leveren aan de visieontwikkeling van het data-/IV-beleid.




Wat is het aanbod qua voorwaarden

Uitstekend salaris;
Dertiende maand en 8% vakantiegeld;
Opleidingen;
Netwerk van professionals;
Modern keuzeplan arbeidsvoorwaarden;
Goede pensioenvoorziening;
We werken hybride, thuis en op kantoor te Amsterdam
Uitzicht op vast contract.




Last but not least : You need to speak Dutch fluently for this position.

Hoe wij jou lanceren naar de stratosfeer




Matchen & Groeien

Het draait niet alleen om de perfecte match vinden tussen jou en een opdrachtgever. Wij helpen je om de volgende stap te zetten in jouw carrière. Bij DataSavvy krijg je niet alleen een opdracht, maar ook begeleiding om je te ontwikkelen. We kijken naar wat jij nodig hebt om je dromen te realiseren.




Skills die er toe doen

Onze trainingen gaan verder dan alleen certificaten behalen. We leren je de nieuwste technieken én helpen je persoonlijke vaardigheden ontwikkelen, zoals teamwork, probleem-oplossend denken en project- management. Data is meer dan cijfers; het gaat om het maken van impact. Dat is waar wij je op voorbereiden.




Detavast: Flexibiliteit met toekomst

We snappen dat je graag flexibel wilt zijn, maar ook zeker wilt zijn van je toekomst. Daarom bieden we de detavast constructie: je start met een tijdelijke opdracht, zodat je ervaring opdoet en ontdekt wat je echt wilt, met uitzicht op een vaste aanstelling. Zo krijg je het beste van beide werelden.




Data Analist

Jouw inzichten maken het verschil. Als Data Analist vertaal je complexe data naar waardevolle inzichten. Jij verzamelt, interpreteert en presenteert data zodat organisaties geïnformeerde keuzes kunnen maken. Je analyseert datasets om trends en patronen te identificeren en je creëert dashboards die helpen om processen te optimaliseren of strategieën aan te passen.




Voorspel trends moeiteloos
Optimaliseer processen effectief
Vertaal data naar actie




Jouw groei is onze missie

Wij geloven dat jij als data professional de toekomst vormgeeft. Ons doel is simpel: jou laten groeien. We investeren in je met uitdagende opdrachten, training en coaching. Of je nu starter bent of ervaren, bij ons blijf je leren en bouw je aan je carrière op jouw tempo, op jouw manier.




Hands on leren met onze labs

Tijdens onze traineeships is er volop ruimte om met je vingers aan de knoppen te zitten. Tuurlijk, is er ook wat zelfstudie. Maar we laten je niet dagenlang video’s bekijken en tutorials lezen van de Microsoft Learn omgeving. Wij hebben ons eigen cloud platform waarin we kunnen spelen en experimenteren met de laatste technologieën. Ja, ook met GenAI . Hiermee bouw je al spelenderwijs een voorsprong op en help je toekomstige opdrachtgevers innovatieve technologieën te omarmen.




Waarom DataSavvy als opleider

DataSavvy is opgericht door zeer ervaren data professionals. Die jou de fijne kneepjes van het vakgebied bijbrengen. Veel meer dus dan alleen een paar certificaten halen. En daarmee ben je veel sneller dan anders junior af.




Waarom Data Analytics als vakgebied?

Omdat data analytics een superinteressant vakgebied is waarin je nooit uitgeleerd raakt. En veel organisaties behoefte hebben aan data professionals. Dus gegarandeerd een baan met goed salaris

Hoe wij jou lanceren naar de stratosfeer




Matchen & Groeien

Het draait niet alleen om de perfecte match vinden tussen jou en een opdrachtgever. Wij helpen je om de volgende stap te zetten in jouw carrière. Bij DataSavvy krijg je niet alleen een opdracht, maar ook begeleiding om je te ontwikkelen. We kijken naar wat jij nodig hebt om je dromen te realiseren.




Skills die er toe doen

Onze trainingen gaan verder dan alleen certificaten behalen. We leren je de nieuwste technieken én helpen je persoonlijke vaardigheden ontwikkelen, zoals teamwork, probleem-oplossend denken en project- management. Data is meer dan cijfers; het gaat om het maken van impact. Dat is waar wij je op voorbereiden.




Detavast: Flexibiliteit met toekomst

We snappen dat je graag flexibel wilt zijn, maar ook zeker wilt zijn van je toekomst. Daarom bieden we de detavast constructie: je start met een tijdelijke opdracht, zodat je ervaring opdoet en ontdekt wat je echt wilt, met uitzicht op een vaste aanstelling. Zo krijg je het beste van beide werelden.




Data Analist

Jouw inzichten maken het verschil. Als Data Analist vertaal je complexe data naar waardevolle inzichten. Jij verzamelt, interpreteert en presenteert data zodat organisaties geïnformeerde keuzes kunnen maken. Je analyseert datasets om trends en patronen te identificeren en je creëert dashboards die helpen om processen te optimaliseren of strategieën aan te passen.




Voorspel trends moeiteloos
Optimaliseer processen effectief
Vertaal data naar actie




Jouw groei is onze missie

Wij geloven dat jij als data professional de toekomst vormgeeft. Ons doel is simpel: jou laten groeien. We investeren in je met uitdagende opdrachten, training en coaching. Of je nu starter bent of ervaren, bij ons blijf je leren en bouw je aan je carrière op jouw tempo, op jouw manier.




Hands on leren met onze labs

Tijdens onze traineeships is er volop ruimte om met je vingers aan de knoppen te zitten. Tuurlijk, is er ook wat zelfstudie. Maar we laten je niet dagenlang video’s bekijken en tutorials lezen van de Microsoft Learn omgeving. Wij hebben ons eigen cloud platform waarin we kunnen spelen en experimenteren met de laatste technologieën. Ja, ook met GenAI . Hiermee bouw je al spelenderwijs een voorsprong op en help je toekomstige opdrachtgevers innovatieve technologieën te omarmen.




Waarom DataSavvy als opleider

DataSavvy is opgericht door zeer ervaren data professionals. Die jou de fijne kneepjes van het vakgebied bijbrengen. Veel meer dus dan alleen een paar certificaten halen. En daarmee ben je veel sneller dan anders junior af.




Waarom Data Analytics als vakgebied?

Omdat data analytics een superinteressant vakgebied is waarin je nooit uitgeleerd raakt. En veel organisaties behoefte hebben aan data professionals. Dus gegarandeerd een baan met goed salaris

A safe space to grow and up-skill. Our learning culture puts you in the driver’s seat of your own development.
An innovative environment with Hack Days once a year. This week-long initiative allows you to think outside the box and deliver creative, technical solutions that (more often than not) go on to be implemented, either in our product or our ways of working.

Hos oss får du chansen att skapa innovativa lösningar som skapar verkliga insikter och beslutsunderlag hos våra kunder. Du får tidigt hoppa in i olika projekt och med stöttning av kompetenta kollegor har du snabbt tagit dig an konsultrollen och utvecklat både dina tekniska kunskaper och generella verksamhetsförståelse. 

 

Om rollen 

Som konsult hos oss arbetar du i parallella projekt med analys av kundens verksamhet och implementering av BI-lösningar. Du jobbar nära kundens projektorganisation och dagliga verksamhet men närmast arbetar du seniora kollegor från Astrada. Du får vara med i hela kedjan genom att omvandla önskemål och behov till färdig systemlösning. För oss är det viktigt att skapa kvalitativa lösningar som är hållbara över tid.  




Vilka är vi? 

Astrada är ett produkt- och konsultbolag inom Data & Analytics som hjälper företag och organisationer i flera branscher runt om i världen att ta fram och implementera systemlösningar för styrning och optimering av verksamheten. Detta kan vara allt från beräkningar av kostnad, lönsamhet eller koldioxidavtryck per produkt inom tillverkningsindustrin, till visuella planeringsunderlag med schemaoptimering inom sjukvården. 

 

Vårt jobb handlar om att ge beslutsfattare rätt information, i rätt tid och vid rätt plats. Därför har vi utvecklat ett eget webbaserat analysverktyg som dessutom är kompatibelt med andra ledande BI-applikationer. Vi verkar i ett ständigt växande område och vår unika kombination av verksamhetskunskap och ett eget AI- och datadrivet system gör att vi snabbt kan bygga och anpassa lösningar för att hjälpa beslutsfattare med de insikter de verkligen behöver. 




Passar vi dig? 

Du kommer att trivas hos oss om du är intresserad av att kombinera dina tekniska kunskaper med ekonomi- och verksamhetsstyrning. Efter en tid här hoppas vi att du är bekväm med att enkelt växla mellan mer tekniska uppgifter till att interagera med verksamheten och skapa lösningar för att utveckla den i rätt riktning. 

 

Astrada arbetar med komplexa och globala organisationer vilket medför ett stort behov av ansvarstagande. För att leverera kontinuerlig kvalitet till dessa kunder värdesätter vi dig som är lyhörd med ett öga för detaljer. Du arbetar tillsammans med dina kollegor för att komma fram till de bästa lösningarna i nära samarbete och dialog med våra kunder. Du är därför kommunikativ och kan förklara tekniska lösningar på ett begripligt sätt samt ger dig an nya uppdrag med ett öppet och lösningsorienterat sinne. Vi uppskattar även dig som kan se ett steg längre och vågar ifrågasätta rutiner och komma med förslag på långsiktiga förbättringar både hos uppdragsgivare och internt.  

Utöver ovanstående tror vi att du: 

Vill utvecklas inom BI, dataanalys och verksamhetsstyrning.    
Har en civilingenjörsutbildning eller master inom data, teknisk fysik, maskinteknik, energi och miljö, systemvetenskap, industriell ekonomi eller liknande. 
Talar och skriver obehindrat både på svenska och engelska. Extra meriterande är det om du även talar finska. 
Gärna besitter kunskaper inom SQL, databashantering eller BI-verktyg, annars får du lära dig det hos oss. 




Det här erbjuder vi dig 

Här får du chansen att jobba inom ett spännande och komplext område på en familjär och stöttande arbetsplats. Vi är en liten organisation med fördelarna av att ha korta beslutsvägar men med högt i tak och stora ambitioner. Hos oss får du utrymme att utvecklas i den riktning du vill med stor frihet att forma din egen karriär. Vi tycker att det är viktigt med balans mellan arbete och vardag och därför är flexibla arbetstider och -lösningar en självklarhet för oss. Arbetet sker mestadels från vårt kontor på Skeppsbron i Stockholm men med frekventa besök hos våra uppdragsgivare.  

 

Låter det här intressant? 

Vi söker dig som snart tar eller nyligen har tagit examen, men även dig med några års erfarenhet inom området.  

Vi rekryterar löpande, så hör av dig så snart som möjligt. Vi ser fram emot att höra från dig!

Ditt arbete med att skapa och underhålla dokumentation samt ansvara för masterdata och relaterade processer kommer att vara centralt för vår Data & analytics-avdelning.

Att jobba som BI-utvecklare

Är du BI-utvecklare och vill vara med i ett gäng med kompetenta kreativa kollegor och skapa förutsättningar för ett mer datadrivet SBAB? Inom Data & Analytics jobbar vi agilt med främst Microsoft BI-stack som grundverktyg. Vi har en mix av killar och tjejer, både juniora och seniora– totalt är vi cirka 50 personer. Ett par dagar i månaden ägnar vi oss åt Hackdays där vi fritt kan prova olika idéer och tekniker, självständigt eller i grupp. Det är ett kreativt arbetssätt att utveckla vår stora verktygslåda.

Som BI-utvecklare på SBAB bör du vara nyfiken, målmedveten och vara en självdrivande lagspelare. Det är bra om du trivs i förändring eftersom det ständigt händer saker hos oss. Du gillar att jobba enligt agila metoder och inser de stora fördelar som kommer med att arbeta nära tillsammans inom ditt team. Vi tror att du har ett stort intresse för data, dataflöden och har ett datadrivet mindset.

Vi söker dig som har:


God kunskap och erfarenhet inom SQL, gärna även databasdesign, för att hantera stora och komplexa datamängder.
Erfarenhet av att arbeta med ETL-processer och dataintegrationslösningar.
Förmåga att samarbeta med affärs- och utvecklingsenheter för att förstå och omsätta verksamhetsbehov till tekniska lösningar.
Bonus om du även har erfarenhet av att visualisera data med hjälp av verktyg som Power Bi och Tableau eller om du har jobbat med programmeringsspråket Python.


Du kommer att jobba i ett litet fullstack-team med Data Analysts, Data Scientists och BI-utvecklare som alla står i nära kontakt med verksamheten, där varje teammedlem bidrar med sin kärnkompetens. Det är meriterande om du har erfarenhet av bank och dess affärsverksamhet.

Vår arbetsplatsstrategi är en hybridlösning mellan att jobba hemma och arbeta från vårt ljusa och luftiga kontor i Solna Business Park med härlig atmosfär, där vi bland annat har fräscha träningslokaler, cykelparkering inomhus och det bästa: vår egen barista.

Har du check på allt?


Analytisk
Ansvarstagande
Kvalitetsmedveten
Ödmjuk
Samarbetsförmåga


Annars då?

Gillar du oss, och tror att du kan bidra, är vårt tips att inte vänta för länge med att skicka in CV eller LinkedIn-profil. Har du andra idéer på hur du kan visa vem du är? Spännande! Hur du än ansöker så ser vi fram emot att lära känna dig mer.

The role can be based in Finland (preferred), or Sweden. You can work onsite, hybrid, or fully remote from one of the mentioned locations - the work format is up to you 🙌

You will work directly with stakeholders across the Wolt people team (as well as the rest of the Wolt business), serving as their thought partner to solve problems and prioritize solutions to big, thorny questions. You will report directly to the US-based Sr. Manager of People Analytics at DoorDash, and will partner closely with them and your US-based peers in Recruiting Analytics and Data Science to lead People Analytics across the globe.

Your daily work will include


Supervising the day-to-day work of your team of analysts responsible for people analytics, recruiting analytics, and similar.
Serving as the trusted advisor, thought leader, and representative of the global People Analytics team to your stakeholders across Wolt.
Leading the development of metrics, reports, dashboards and analyses, putting high-quality insights directly into the hands of your stakeholders.
Developing a cohesive vision and roadmap together with your peers and partner teams across the globe, including US-based Data Science, People Analytics, Recruiting Analytics, Data Engineering, and People Applications teams.
Dive into the data, diagnosing data and reporting needs, building new solutions, and providing answers to big, ambiguous, critical problems.


Our humble expectations

Strong experience working as an Analyst, BI Developer, Analytics Engineer, Data Scientist, or techy Data Analyst. People/HR Analytics experience is strongly preferred.

Demonstrated experience working with and influencing technical and nontechnical cross-functional peers and stakeholders. This will be a highly visible role within the People Team, and building trust with your colleagues will be critical.
Tech skills: Python, SQL, R, AWS, and one of the modern BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Sigma, or similar). Advanced SQL skills, and ability to write optimized queries for large data sets.
Subject Matter Expertise: Deep expertise in data visualization and analysis. Some expertise in statistics is preferred (regressions, t-tests). Nice to have: Experience analyzing survey data.

Förutom intressanta arbetsuppgifter och kontinuerlig kompetensutveckling har vi många andra förmåner inom Försvarsmakten. En uppskattad förmån är att vi har möjlighet att träna tre timmar i veckan på arbetstid. Vi har även bra flextidsavtal, föräldralön och möjlighet att studera på arbetstid med bibehållen lön.

Avdelningen Analys och stödAnalys och stöd består av 8 medarbetare med tyngdpunkt på analys och datahantering. Avdelningen spelar en viktig roll i Försvarsmaktens attraktions- och relationsskapande verksamhet. Arbetsplatsen är resultat- och utvecklingsorienterad med en positiv framåtanda där medarbetare ständigt utvecklas.

Huvudsakliga arbetsuppgifterMed data i fokus bidrar du till att utveckla och stärka Försvarsmaktens förmåga att attrahera och rekrytera personal. Du kommer främst att jobba med data i, Försvarsmaktens CRM-system/verktyg samt relaterade databaser.

Som dataanalytiker är du en viktig spelare i vår förmåga att få fram målgruppsanpassad kommunikation där du kommer att arbeta med att identifiera och strukturera data för tolkning. Det innebär att du identifierar och strukturerar rådata från olika källor med avancerade datamodeller. I arbetet ingår också löpande uppgifter som till exempel att göra målgruppsurval till kampanjaktiviteter.

Du kommer att vara experten inom ditt område och vi ser gärna att du kan leda utvecklingen av våra datafrågor framåt och bidra till att framtidssäkra våra förmågor.

Du kommer även att ha ett nära samarbete med datakvalitetshandläggare för att säkerställa att data är korrekt, uppdaterad och användbar.

För att lyckas i rollen behöver du ha en gedigen förståelse för databaser och dess strukturer och hur datamodeller fungerar. Du behöver också känna dig bekväm med att hitta data (från olika källor) och strukturera samt utveckla den. Om du har en förståelse för de processer som är relevanta för framgångsrika kundresor och relationshantering är det en stor fördel.

Du har en god förståelse för vad som behövs ur ett analysperspektiv i det lilla och det stora perspektivet – från att ta fram ett urval till att förstå vad som behöver utvecklas för att verksamheten ska kunna optimeras och möta framtida behov både vad gäller analyser och datautveckling. Vi söker dig som är driven, lösningsorienterad och som uppskattar att jobba i team men som också kan samarbeta och driva dialog med olika berörda funktioner som IT-förvaltningen, andra avdelningar m fl. I rollen kommer du att ha stor möjlighet att påverka både kommunikationsupplägg och arbetssätt.

Krav:

Kvalifikationer


Relevant eftergymnasial utbildning.
Arbetslivserfarenhet i en liknande roll.
Erfarenhet av att hantera och strukturera data från olika typer av källor till exempel med hjälp av ETL-script.
Erfarenhet av relationella databaser eller SQL-databaser.
God förmåga att kommunicera på svenska i tal och skrift.


Personliga egenskaper

Du som söker denna roll har lätt för att ta till dig nya arbetssätt och har lätt att lära. Som person är du strukturerad med god förmåga att se samband och tänka analytiskt och strategiskt. Det är viktigt att du som söker är van vid att både arbeta självständigt och i projektform samt kan driva utvecklingen av verksamheten framåt med verksamhetsnytta i fokus. Du trivs i en organisation under förändring och utveckling. Du trivs i samarbete och har ett lösningsorienterat förhållningssätt. Du är relationsbyggande och lyhörd då du i ditt arbete kommer att arbeta med människor med olika erfarenheter och perspektiv.

Vara med och skapa vår vision om ett mer datadrivet SBAB
Utveckla och optimera BI-lösningar för att stödja affärsbeslut och rapportering
Hantera och förbättra dataintegration och ETL-processer för att säkerställa korrekt och effektiv dataflöde


Är du redo för något intressant? På SBAB jobbar vi värderingsdrivet. Wow! Hoppas vi att du tänker, men vi förstår om det inte känns som något nytt eller om ordet inte väcker det intresse som vi vill.

Men våra värderingar är viktiga för oss på riktigt! De handlar om att jobba smart med fart, ta ansvar hela vägen, vara stolta proffs och att lyckas tillsammans. Faktum är att värderingarna hjälper oss att fatta kloka beslut och vi vill att du gör detsamma hos oss. De hjälper dig i rätt riktning, stöttar att ta egna initiativ, ha roligt tillsammans, jobba ihop och bidra till att våra kunder får en bättre boendeekonomi. Fortfarande intresserad? Välkommen!

Att jobba som BI-utvecklare

Är du BI-utvecklare och vill vara med i ett gäng med kompetenta kreativa kollegor och skapa förutsättningar för ett mer datadrivet SBAB? Inom Data & Analytics jobbar vi agilt med främst Microsoft BI-stack som grundverktyg. Vi har en mix av killar och tjejer, både juniora och seniora– totalt är vi cirka 50 personer. Ett par dagar i månaden ägnar vi oss åt Hackdays där vi fritt kan prova olika idéer och tekniker, självständigt eller i grupp. Det är ett kreativt arbetssätt att utveckla vår stora verktygslåda.

Som BI-utvecklare på SBAB bör du vara nyfiken, målmedveten och vara en självdrivande lagspelare. Det är bra om du trivs i förändring eftersom det ständigt händer saker hos oss. Du gillar att jobba enligt agila metoder och inser de stora fördelar som kommer med att arbeta nära tillsammans inom ditt team. Vi tror att du har ett stort intresse för data, dataflöden och har ett datadrivet mindset.

Vi söker dig som har:


God kunskap och erfarenhet inom SQL, gärna även databasdesign, för att hantera stora och komplexa datamängder.
Erfarenhet av att arbeta med ETL-processer och dataintegrationslösningar.
Förmåga att samarbeta med affärs- och utvecklingsenheter för att förstå och omsätta verksamhetsbehov till tekniska lösningar.
Bonus om du även har erfarenhet av att visualisera data med hjälp av verktyg som Power Bi och Tableau eller om du har jobbat med programmeringsspråket Python.


Du kommer att jobba i ett litet fullstack-team med Data Analysts, Data Scientists och BI-utvecklare som alla står i nära kontakt med verksamheten, där varje teammedlem bidrar med sin kärnkompetens. Det är meriterande om du har erfarenhet av bank och dess affärsverksamhet.

Vår arbetsplatsstrategi är en hybridlösning mellan att jobba hemma och arbeta från vårt ljusa och luftiga kontor i Solna Business Park med härlig atmosfär, där vi bland annat har fräscha träningslokaler, cykelparkering inomhus och det bästa: vår egen barista.

Har du check på allt?


Analytisk
Ansvarstagande
Kvalitetsmedveten
Ödmjuk
Samarbetsförmåga


Annars då?

Gillar du oss, och tror att du kan bidra, är vårt tips att inte vänta för länge med att skicka in CV eller LinkedIn-profil. Har du andra idéer på hur du kan visa vem du är? Spännande! Hur du än ansöker så ser vi fram emot att lära känna dig mer.

Som Data Engineer hos cVation bygger du dataplatforme, datawarehouses samt laver MLOps løsninger i skyen for vores kunder. Vi arbejder med en række spændende teknologier, herunder Databricks, Fabric, Azure Machine Learning, Data Factory, Azure Synapse og Spark, og laver ikke bare dataudtræk, men bygger ting, der skal i Prod. Vi leder derfor efter flere profiler med erfaring indenfor enten MLOps, datawarehouses eller dataplatforme, som har lyst til at bygge dataløsninger for vores kunder.




cVation er et dansk udviklings- og konsulenthus, som bygger avancerede cloudløsninger på Azure med afsæt i markedets hurtigste og mest agile metoder. Cvation blev stiftet i 2014, har modtaget tre Børsen Gazeller og vundet Microsofts Partner Award for App Innovation tre år i træk. Vi arbejder dedikeret med agile arbejdsmetoder, DevOps og Test Driven Development, og er på forkant med mange af de nye teknologier, herunder IoT. Vi sætter en ære i at levere software af den højeste kvalitet, og tager desuden principperne fra DevOps og software engineering med i vores dataprojekter, hvilket betyder, at tests, Infrastructure as Code og automatisering er i fokus.




Hvilken rolle får du?




Du kommer til at arbejde på et af vores dataprojekter med et projektteam bestående af arkitekter, software udviklere og DevOps specialister. Du vil have fuldt fokus på ét projekt og være tilknyttet ét team ad gangen.




Din rolle bliver at




rådgive om og bygge datamigrerings- og datamoderniseringsprojekter
rådgive om og bygge datawarehouse/dataplatformsløsninger i skyen
rådgive om og bygge løsninger indenfor MLOps
bidrage til design og implementering af den optimale Azure infrastruktur
sikre, at alt opsætning og provisionering sker som infrastructure as code
fuldautomatiseret overvågning og skalering af løsninger




Hvad forventer vi af dig?




Du har en videregående uddannelse i data engineering, data science, Human centered AI el lign. fra DTU, ITU eller KU
Du har enten fullstack MLOps erfaring og kan skrive Python - eller måske kommer du i stedet med erfaring i at bygge datawarehouse og dataplatforme. Vi skal nok lære dig det, du mangler på Azure, IaC, MLOps etc.
Du vil gerne arbejde med de nyeste teknologier i Azure
Infrastructure as code er måden du arbejder på, f.eks. Bicep eller Terraform
Du har erfaring med nogle - og vil gerne blive klogere på - flere af følgende teknologier: Data Factory - Databricks - Fabric - Azure Synapse - Azure Machine Learning - MLflow - Spark - Data Warehouse - Data platform - Python - Azure DevOps, Powershell, Azure CLI, ARM templates, YAML, Bicep, Terraform, Git
Du vil gerne indgå i et agilt setup, hvor krav og retning hurtigt kan ændres, men hvor medbestemmelse og frihed er i højsædet
Du er flydende i skrift og tale på dansk og engelsk, og trives med at have den daglige kontakt med kunden
Du har evnen til at omsætte kundebehov til handling




Det vil være en fordel, hvis:

Du er vant til at arbejde som konsulent i et udviklingsteam i tæt samarbejde med arkitekter og software udviklere




Som person er du selvstændig, ansvarsbevidst, initiativrig, eksekverende og serviceminded. Du er drevet af at lære nyt og vild med at holde dig ajour med de nyeste metoder og teknologier. Du er engageret og motiveret i alt hvad du foretager dig. Hvis du også er glad for at sparre med dygtige kollegaer og trives med at løfte i flok, vil du passe perfekt ind hos os.




Hvad tilbyder vi?




Du kommer til at indgå i vores voksende team, hvor høj faglighed, innovation og arbejdsglæde er i højsæde. Det høje faglige niveau blandt dine kollegaer giver en unik mulighed for at arbejde med de bedste, og vi tager din faglige udvikling alvorligt. Vi har en flad organisation med et minimum af administration, hvor ledelsens døre altid er åbne, og der er god plads til både bordfodbold, fredagsbar, frokost på kajen og et aktivt liv udenfor arbejdstid. Flere gange om året afholder vi hackathons, hvor vi i teams dykker ned i præcis de emner, som udviklerne finder interessante. En del af vores kultur er også, at vi gerne ser alle komme med input til hvordan vi kan optimere, udvikle og forbedre cVation.




Hvorfor vælge os som din nye arbejdsplads?




Vores fundament er løsninger bygget på Microsoft Azure Cloud. Alle vores medarbejdere mestrer cloud-native udvikling og DevOps. Vi arbejder i projekter og engagerer os hands-on i fælles teams med vores kunder for at sikre kvalitet og effektiv videndeling.




Vi er passionerede omkring at hjælpe vores kunder med at få det maksimale ud af cloudteknologien. For os er cloud ikke blot infrastruktur eller et nyt datacenter i skyen. Teknologien giver virksomheder mulighed for at skabe væsentligt mere værdi og arbejde med agilitet og innovation på en helt ny måde.




Vi har været med fra starten, da cloud blev udviklet og tilgængeligt. Vi tilbyder således vores årelange erfaring og dybe cloud ekspertise samt en værktøjskasse med alle vores best practices i form af accelerationsplatformen CADD. Den dækker over gennemprøvede værktøjer, rammeværk, effektive udviklingsmetoder og færdige automatiseringskomponenter. Alt dette for at sikre, at projekter kommer hurtigt og sikkert fra start.




Du vil blive en del af en virksomhed, som tror på, at alle har betydning, og at det skal være sjovt at gå på arbejde hver dag. Du vil få kollegaer, der er interesseret i at lære og har ønske om at blive de bedste til det, de gør. Vi tilbyder derfor gode muligheder for at udvikle dig.

Are you passionate about data and adding value through reports, and do you want to work in a global production company within the food industry?




At Palsgaard, we have set out on an ambitious growth journey to double our production capacity over the next couple of years. Part of that journey is to rethink our global business processes and how we use data to create more valuable insights and reports. We have started implementing a global ERP platform, Dynamics 365FO, and as part of this, extensive global reports become even more crucial to the business.




As our new BI consultant, you will be responsible for developing solutions to our existing Microsoft Azure cloud-based data platform and building value-added Power BI reports to ambitious colleagues around the world.




You will be part of our highly qualified, global IT team of 16 dedicated IT professionals. A team where we value an informal environment and pursue strong collaboration to achieve our goals and have fun while doing so - we always support each other in getting the job done. We value personal development and offer the opportunity to take on other responsibilities as you develop in the role.




You will report to Martin Nordestgaard, Team Leader for Global BI and Data Platform. The team currently consists of 2 colleagues. The position is placed at our headquarter in Juelsminde (DK) where you will experience a flexible workday, including the opportunity to work from home.




Responsibilities:

Further develop and maintain our cloud-based data warehouse.
Develop Power BI reports in cooperation with our Finance Business Partners and the existing BI team.
Improve and structure reports based on the principles of storytelling (Strategic -> Analytical -> Informative/Operational).
Delivering high quality analytical solutions after best practices and our governance in BI-development, data modelling and report design.




What do you need to apply?

Our ideal candidate holds a BI background such as for example a cand.merc.BI or equivalent with proven experience in a global company or as a consultant.

Technical skills
Advanced: Azure SQL DB and T-SQL, Azure Data Factory, analytical data modelling (star schema) and Power BI.
Basic: Microsoft Azure, Azure DevOps.
Basic understanding of ERP-systems and production companies.




As a person, you are a self-starter with a curious and analytical mindset and a constant focus on making progress to deliver a valuable product.

The system our team is designing will support 1/3rd of the world's ad campaigns, so the scope is huge, and the success of our team depends on our ability in the near term to demonstrate to key stakeholders the superiority of our system, and then follow up on that promise in the mid-long term.




What You’ll Do:

Collaborate with a high-performing team to explore, design, and implement proprietary models based on contemporary research papers. Your role will have a focus on designing and building out the supporting data pipelines and cloud infrastructure.

Work on the full software engineering lifecycle, from first design to initial implementation, to maintenance of stable products everyone relies on.




Who You Are:

You have a strong academic background (PhD or Master’s in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Data Science, or related field).
You’re passionate about solving real-world problems with advanced models and scalable architectures.
You have previous experience working end-to-end on a large project (not necessarily software engineering).
A strong communicator who thrives in collaborative environments and is eager to learn from and mentor others.
You want to learn about and work with strongly typed programming languages, cloud infrastructure, and huge data pipelines.
You understand the virtue of building an 80% solution first, and then iterating as needed afterwards.




Bonus Points:

If you have previous programming experience.
If you have contributed to one or more open-source projects.




Why Join Us?

Be a key player in shaping the future of privacy-first advertising and audience modelling using cutting-edge AI techniques and highly performant computing systems.
Join an elite team where your research and technical contributions will have a direct impact on strategic outcomes. Work with massive, industry-scale data sets and the latest machine learning techniques.
Growth opportunities; collaborate with leading minds in the field, present your work at major industry conferences, and push the boundaries of applied machine learning.

Vi skaber de mest værdifulde løsninger, når vi er datadrevne. Du er allerede vant til at omsætte både kvalitative og kvantitative data til indsigt, som vi kan arbejde med. Hvis du kan fortælle de historier, som dataene viser os, så er det dig, vi søger!

I Tryg Privat udvikler vi forsikringsprodukter til over 1 million danskere. Vores vigtigste opgave er at sikre gode kundeoplevelser, og vi er stolte af vores høje kundetilfredshed. Vi har ambitiøse mål om at forbedre os endnu mere, og som CX Data Analyst får du en nøglerolle i denne rejse.

Om jobbet | Skab udvikling

Rollen som vores nye CX Data Analyst er alsidig og bred. Du er analytisk af sind, kan omsætte forretningens behov og sprog til dataindsigter, har flair for design af datavisualisering og kan arbejde med store datamængder i Excel og Power BI. Du skaber fundamentet og indsigterne, som er afgørende for at forbedre kundeoplevelserne. Derfor er du også dygtig til både samarbejde og kommunikation.

Vi har et af Nordens største CX-data frameworks gennem Qualtrics, som danner grundlaget for vores CX-data. Din primære opgave vil være at arbejde med forretningens behov for indsigter inden for dette framework. Dette inkluderer alt fra CSAT-score og driverspørgsmål til ustruktureret feedback fra kundekommentarer, kundefornyelse og metadata, der kan segmentere og forfine indsigterne i vores kundebase.

Om dig | Tag ansvar

Vi ser gerne, at du har erfaring med at arbejde med kundeindsigter og løbende analyserer og rapporterer disse til forretningen. Du skal kunne analysere data i forhold til kundesegmenter og bestandssammensætning, samt sikre vores metodiske grundlag. Det er vigtigt, at du kan kvalificere problemområder i forhold til både kundetilfredshed og forretningsværdi.

Du vil fungere som bindeled til andre enheder og løbende kommunikere om kundetilfredshed og andre enheders områder. Derudover vil du være sparringspartner i projekter, der kræver ""kundens stemme"", og muligvis også drive projekter selv. Du deltager aktivt i og måske endda faciliterer tværnordisk vidensdeling.

Kort sagt, du ved, hvad der er vigtigt for vores kunder, og du formår at aktivere denne viden på tværs af vores enheder.

Advansor is looking for a Student Helper - Business Intelligence to become part of a successful company driven by climate actions.




The Student Helper should be able to work approximately 2 days per week. The total number of working hours can also be spread over more than 2 days, but the exact working schedule will be planned on an ongoing basis.




Your role

The Controlling department at Advansor acts as support function for management, providing data for decision-making.




You will participate in project work related to data management, governance and implementation of new systems in co-operation with IT and Accounting. This also means that you will cooperate with departments across the entire organisation.




Your main tasks will include:

Play a role in our efforts on data governance
Participate in securing Optimal use of data to support business strategies
Analyses and reports, including creation and updating reports and dashboards in PowerBI
Participate in project work on data governance and business intelligence
Secure that data is structured, accessible and easy to understand for technical and non-technical colleagues
Participate in the development and implementation of new governance structure, securing correct collection, structuring and use of data
Work with different data models and data protection as well as participating in practical data tasks
Securing that all data efforts are connected to the strategic targets of the company




What does the position require from you?

You are probably studying Cand. Merc. BI or Cand. Merc. IT, but it is not a requirement. You are fluent in English as you will be working with colleagues of many different nationalities.




In order to succeed in the position, you must be curious about how things work and have the desire to learn new things. It is only positive if you are critical and open to ask questions – better too many than too few.




The tasks you will handle require some knowledge about PowerBI. You don’t have to be an expert, but you must be willing to learn. In general, you are expected to take responsibility for own learning.




When working in the Controlling department, no two days are the same. Unplanned tasks will always come up, so you should be comfortable with handling sudden changes in priorities.




Knowledge to DAX will be an advantage but is not a requirement.




We offer

As part of Team Advansor, you will get to work with more than 350 competent colleagues of more than 35 different nationalities and join us in our mission: to design and produce the world’s best sustainable climate solutions. You will become part of a highly ambitious company that values a good working environment, diversity, and teamwork.




The company is located in Brabrand close to E45 with good access and within walking distance to the bus stop.




If you are interested in the position, please send your application and CV in English online through our website. We aim for a start date mid-February, but it is not a prerequisite for employment that you will be able to start exactly then.




Please contact Malene Birck Jensen, Operation Controller at mbj@advansor.com if you have any questions about the position or Advansor as a workplace.




We look forward to receiving your application.




Sustainable CO2 climate solutions

As a market-leading manufacturer, we have designed and produced more than 16,000 CO2 systems for sustainable commercial and industrial cooling and heating around the world since 2006.




Many people associate CO2 with global warming. We’re cool with that. Literally. Because CO2 is the most climate-friendly refrigerant: It is non-toxic, non-flammable and does not harm our drinking water. That is why we are ’cool with CO2’.

Data is an incredibly important asset to our organisation, and now is your chance to join our digital business transformation and contribute to shaping the future of data in Lind Capital. 




Who we are 

At Lind Capital, we take a different approach to trading. We're a team of 20+ market specialists and analytical thinkers who collaborate to combine technical expertise with market understanding. With no external investors, we are free to focus on making the best possible trades using quantitative models. 




Data in Lind Capital 

Data is central to Lind Capital’s success and key to our future growth, and therefore we are looking to expand our resources within the area. You become part of our international technology team which currently consists of 8 software engineers, data engineers and data scientists. On a daily basis, you will be working in one of our cross-functional squads of professionals who enjoy solving complex problems together in our effort to advance on our tech and data journey. 




The job 

The main tasks of your team are to develop and maintain solutions solving complex business problems by utilizing vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. As our new Data Engineer, you will play an important role in preparing and serving data for both trading applications, analytics and our machine learning models. Also, you will play an important role in the development of data solutions and data usage at large.  

If you are skilled and motivated to build solutions to bring raw data into actionable output, you will be able to make a big impact in our organization.  

More specifically, your tasks will include: 

Collaborate closely with data scientists, software and ML engineers in a cross-functional setting identifying and facilitating both analytics and ML requirements for data
Design, develop and maintain batch and streaming data pipelines from end-to-end.  
Enable both batch and live serving of data for applications, analytics and ML models. 
Build data quality monitoring tools and improving pipeline observability. 
Develop our data management framework. 
Build and maintain our infrastructure in AWS using infrastructure-as-code tools.  
Contribute to our data strategy and promote good engineering practices.  




You make the difference 

Technical capabilities are required, but personality makes the difference. We aim for a cooperative work environment with a high level of knowledge sharing. A work environment where everybody assumes personal responsibility, and where teamwork and communication skills are essential. 

The trading strategies we pursue are all based on a complex combination of tech, data, numbers, and market know-how. This means your ability to go beyond your comfort zone and engage with experts in other areas is paramount to our success. 

You are a team player and have an open-minded attitude. You can communicate ideas and technical topics honestly and clearly – also to non-experts – while respecting the views of others on the team. You are eager to understand and find solutions, allowing you to quickly adapt to changing situations and come up with new ideas.  

We're looking for someone who brings: 

Clean and efficient Python code (experience with other programming languages is a plus). 
Practical experience in creating and maintaining data intensive solutions from a similar role. 
Experience with orchestration frameworks like Apache Airflow. 
Experience with containerization frameworks like Docker. 
Experience with SQL and NoSQL DBMS for both transactional and analytical workloads. 
Experience with Big-data solutions for distributed storage and computing like Hadoop or Spark. 
Familiarity with cloud providers (preferably AWS), time series data, CI/CD pipelines, GIT and/or infrastructure as code.  




We encourage you to apply even if you don't meet all the listed qualifications. 




Life at the office 

We bring together talented people from diverse backgrounds. You will become part of an informal and diverse work environment where we focus on creating results together, and where you will be empowered to make decisions. We generally dislike meetings, PowerPoints, politics, and committees, but prefer to look at the code or the chart together over the screen for a few minutes and make the decisions there and then. 

We value work-life balance and support our team members' personal and professional commitments. While our dynamic work environment may require additional work hours, we ensure flexibility works both ways - whether you need time for personal appointments, family responsibilities, or other important life events. Our focus is on results and impact rather than rigid schedules. 




The practical stuff 

This position is based in Aarhus, Denmark. We operate in English and welcome international candidates. 

Start date: As soon as possible. 

To apply, please submit your CV and motivation letter. 

Applications will be processed on a rolling basis.

Help us create value from data and build our new data platform!

About the job | Data Engineer

Tryg has a long tradition of working with data to understand risks. We are now taking this experience to the next level and expanding our activities to many different customer-centric initiatives. As data from the customer touchpoints is scattered in a series of different systems, we are building a data platform to obtain easy, purpose-driven, and compliant access to data.

In your role as our new Data Engineer, you will get full responsibility for implementing one or more data sources in the data layer. The work comprises technical disciplines such as data analysis, understanding of the ACORD data model, implementation of streaming ETL, and data quality tests.

As the best solutions are made in collaboration, you will engage with people from across the organization and will work closely with data scientists, app developers, business analysts, and business sponsors. You will join a large and ever-growing data engineering community in Tryg of like-minded people.

Our tech stack is ever-growing and evolving ensuring we stay up to date with the technology, as we often have to work on the edge of streaming. As a data engineer, you will mainly be exposed to:


SQL and SQLMesh – This is used to write the transformation logic
Trino and RisingWave – These are our execution engines
Kafka – Kafka is used as the streaming platform. Our pipelines work purely on Kafka; both input and output
GIT – Everything must go into a Git repository, and together with our DevOps team we are moving toward a GitOps setup.
GraphQL – Used as an integration layer to other systems to read data from


Through your collaboration with our Platform team you might also be exposed to the following technologies:


Docker
K8S
Operators
CI Pipelines


About you | Curious about learning new technologies

As mentioned the data engineering tech stack is heavily focused around Kafka and streaming. It is an advantage if you can demonstrate experience with some of these, but your great curiosity and an eternal willingness to invest in your own development are more important. We are constantly looking for smarter ways of working and your contribution is important. Prior work exposure with the Insurance domain is an advantage but not a pre-requisite.

We imagine that you are curious by nature and that you have a great appetite to get things done. You are very self-driven but enjoy working together with others. The team is scattered across many countries, so communicating online - both written and verbal - is not an issue for you.

You most likely have a background in a data-related field, and are used to analyzing and understanding large datasets. Solid experience with data analysis or Java development is wanted, but the lack of it can be compensated with analytical skills, a can-do attitude, and a willingness to learn from your experienced colleagues. Up until now you might only have worked with batch processing but want to expand your skillset with streaming – a journey we look forward to accompanying you on!

About Us

This is the very right moment to join us, as we focus strongly on digitalizing and innovating our services and business processes. Data is an incredibly important asset for Tryg, and you will have a large impact on the platforms we develop.

You will be part of a dedicated team of top professionals who implement Tryg's strategic ambitions based on a highly amplified data architecture. You will have a great deal of personal responsibility and have wide opportunities to learn and grow your knowledge.

We look forward to hearing from you!

Please send your application as soon as possible and no later than February 11th, 2025. We will be conducting interviews continuously and close the recruitment process when we find the right candidate.

The interview process consists of three interviews: 1) a technical interview with a take-home task given beforehand, 2) an interview where we talk about the team and tasks, and 3) an interview where the talent acquisition partner from HR participates as well.

If you have any questions about the role, please feel free to contact Andreas Harmuth, Data Engineering Manager, by email andreas.harmuth@tryg.dk or phone +45 29 12 90 70.

Welcome to European Power

You’ll be part of the Digital Trading team where you, together with your colleagues, will work on automated trading strategies from inception to deployment. You’ll be part of a newly established team where you’ll collaborate closely with traders to extract the most value from our 10 GW portfolio of renewable assets and create additional value with our proprietary trading strategies. As a team, we're commercially focused but technically savvy. We collaborate in an informal, laid-back environment where every voice is heard so that we all bring the best ideas forward.

You’ll play an important role in:


developing and perfecting our balancing algorithm to ensure the best execution of our assets
conceptualising and developing trading strategies in close collaboration with traders
continuously improving production strategies to drive profits
analysing data and training statistical models to predict prices and fundamental variables
writing robust, well-tested code and deploying it to production.


To succeed in the role, you:


have knowledge of, or an interest in learning about, the energy markets
like to work on interesting mathematical problems but are motivated by releasing your solutions in the real world
have a get-stuff-done mentality and are comfortable with trade-offs between speed and quality when needed
are numerically literate and have a good understanding of statistics and data science concepts
have professional experience as a Python developer and have a solid grasp of best practices within DevOps.


Maybe you’ve read the above and can see you have some transferable skills, even though they don’t quite match all the points. If you think you can bring something to the team, we still encourage you to apply.

Brænder du for at arbejde med komplekse opgaver?

Så er du måske én af de softwareudviklere, som vi er på jagt efter!

Hos EG Silkeborg Data har vi en ambition om at være den offentlige sektors mest værdifulde samarbejdspartner. Vi udvikler og varetager driften af produkter inden for bl.a. Løn, Økonomi, Medarbejderadministration, Organisation og Ledelsesinformation til kunder i det offentlige Danmark. Når vi gang på gang leverer unikke kvalitetsløsninger til kommuner og regioner, skyldes det, at vi er engagerede og alle brænder for at fastholde og udvikle det danske velfærdssystem gennem digitalisering.

Byg Bro mellem Data og Beslutninger

Medarbejderne i de offentlige institutioner forventer at få den rette løn til den rette tid, og det er vores ansvar at sikre at det sker. Lønberegning er komplekst, så høj kvalitet i vores løsninger og i vores leverancer er vigtig, for at sikre en høj kundetilfredshed. Data & BI Teamet bidrager til at skabe det bedste datagrundlag for at hjælpe vores kunder med at tage de rigtige beslutninger.

Alt data bliver trukket ud fra vores forskellige kildesystemer, og det ender i DB2 eller Oracle tabeller. Vi samler det hele sammen i vores Data Warehouse, hvor vi bearbejder og strukturerer dataene, så de kan præsenteres enten på sd.dk/sddw (SAS) eller via vores IBM-Cognos løsning som læser data fra vores ms-sqlserver.

Du kan se frem til en dagligdag med opgaver som:


Drift/overvågning af dataflow til DW og BI - primært decentralt, men også Host.
3. level teknisk support (kundehenvendelser, som vores kolleger i support har brug for hjælp til).
Bug fixing fra DataInput til DataOutput.
Opdatere sikkerhed/servicepacks/hot-fixes på vores MS-Server og SAS installation.
Fejlsøgning/Datadetektiv.
Analyse og opgavebeskrivelse ifm. nye kundekrav/-opgaver.
Udvikling på og af vores eksisterende platform og teknologistak.
Datastrategi: hvor skal vi hen på længere sigt.
Forvaltning og vedligehold af en platform med stor kompleksitet.
Sikre høj kvalitet i løsningen gennem reviews og test.


Du kommer med viden om og erfaring med én eller flere af nedenstående kompetencer i værktøjskassen.

Vi forventer du har erfaring med:


Microsoft SQL server.
SSIS.
SQL Performance.


Derudover vil det være en fordel, men ikke et krav, hvis du har kendskab til:


Visual Studio.
TFS/GIT.
SAS backend.
Linux.
Oracle queries.
Database: Oracle og DB2.
DB2 queries AQT.
Forståelse af Data arkitektur, begreber som Fact/Dimensioner, Star-schema og Snowflake.


For at blive en succes i rollen, er det vigtigt, at du…


Har stærke analytiske evner, og har mod på at sætte dig ind i et komplekst område.
Er god til at kommunikere med kollegerne omkring dig, hvad enten det f.eks. er en forretningsudvikler en kollega fra support- eller salgsteamet.
Kan samarbejde i et globalt setup med kolleger i både Danmark og Polen, så det er vigtigt, at du er flydende i engelsk, både mundtligt og skriftligt.
Og ikke mindst, at du er en teamspiller, der byder ind med energi, humør og viljen til at lykkes.


Hvad kan du forvente af os?


Fleksible arbejdstider, hvor du selv har mulighed for at planlægge din arbejdsdag.
Mulighed for hjemmearbejdsplads og hjemmearbejde efter behov eller arbejde på vores kontor primært i Aarhus.
Mulighed for at sætte dit fingeraftryk på metoder og løsninger.
Stillingen er i en spændende virksomhed, der er i en rivende udvikling.
Attraktiv frokost-, frugt og kaffe/the-ordning.
Aktiv personaleforening der arrangerer gode sociale events
Sundhedsforsikring.
In-house klinik med f.eks. fysioterapeut som supplement til sundhedsforsikring.

Vi udvikler fremtidens vertikale software, der påvirker kunderne og samfundet på en bæredygtig måde. Vi stræber altid efter at blive bedre: Vi er et dedikeret team af innovatører og problemløsere. Som en integreret del af vores kultur tager vi ansvar for vores bidrag til kunderne, hinanden og det samfund, vi lever i.

Hos DK Company søger vi en BI Developer, der med erfaring og engagement kan være med til at styrke vores BI-løsninger. Du vil spille en vigtig rolle i at omsætte komplekse datasæt til brugbare indsigter og rapporter, der understøtter strategiske beslutninger og skaber værdi for forretningen.




Om at være BI Developer

Som BI Developer hos DK Company bliver du en vigtig del af vores BI-team, der arbejder på at skabe robuste og brugervenlige dataløsninger. Du tager ansvar for at udvikle rapporter og dashboards i Power BI og sikrer, at forretningens behov omsættes til konkrete løsninger med høj værdi.




Din rolle er både praktisk og analytisk, og du vil arbejde tæt sammen med kolleger i hele organisationen for at levere dataløsninger, der gør en forskel. Samtidig har du mulighed for at videreudvikle dine kompetencer gennem samarbejde med erfarne kolleger og adgang til de nyeste teknologier.




En typisk dag kan starte med teamets standup-møde, hvor dagens opgaver prioriteres. Herefter arbejder du med at designe og optimere Power BI-rapporter, der både har et solidt teknisk fundament og en intuitiv brugerflade. Du samarbejder med Business Partners, Data Engineers og øvrige BI Developere for at sikre, at løsningerne lever op til forretningens krav, og du bidrager til at forbedre eksisterende rapporter gennem performanceoptimering og feedback fra brugerne.




Ansvarsområder og fokus i rollen

Udvikle og vedligeholde Power BI-rapporter og dashboards, der er intuitive og brugervenlige, og som skaber værdi for forretningen.
Opbygge og optimere datamodeller med fokus på præcision, performance og brugervenlighed.
Supportere og uddanne brugere, så de kan få det fulde udbytte af Power BI-løsningerne, og yde løbende teknisk support ved behov.
Tage ejerskab for dine løsninger og sikre deres stabilitet og kvalitet over tid.
Samarbejde tæt med Business Partners, Data Engineers og øvrige BI Developere for at forstå forretningens krav og sikre, at dine leverancer opfylder behovene.
Deltage i forbedringsarbejde ved at identificere optimeringsmuligheder og løbende justere eksisterende rapporter og løsninger.




Om hvordan du lykkes i rollen

For at lykkes som BI Developer hos DK Company kræves en kombination af teknisk ekspertise, forretningsforståelse og stærke samarbejdsevner. Du har erfaring med Power BI og SQL og er fortrolig med at arbejde med datamodellering og rapportering.




Du har en analytisk tilgang og evner at omsætte komplekse data til handlingsorienterede indsigter, der skaber værdi for forretningen. Samtidig motiveres du af at samarbejde med kolleger på tværs af organisationen og tager ansvar for at levere løsninger af høj kvalitet.




Du har en naturlig nysgerrighed og en lyst til konstant at forbedre dig, lære nye teknologier og udforske innovative måder at arbejde med data på. Din stræben efter at udvikle dine færdigheder gør dig til en værdifuld del af teamet, og du bidrager til en kultur, hvor vi hele tiden arbejder på at blive bedre.




Tre vigtige kvalifikationer for rollen

Teknisk ekspertise: Erfaring med Power BI og DAX samt forståelse for datamodellering og rapportering. Erfaring med SQL er en fordel.
Forretningsforståelse: Du har en stærk evne til at forstå og omsætte forretningsbehov til dataløsninger. Erfaring fra modebranchen eller tilsvarende dynamiske og sæsonprægede brancher er en klar fordel.
Samarbejdsevner: Stærke kommunikationsevner og evnen til at samarbejde på tværs af teams og interessenter.




Din nysgerrighed og ambition om at udvikle dig sikrer, at dine løsninger ikke blot skaber værdi i dag, men også er fremtidssikrede. Du tager ansvar for dine opgaver og arbejder struktureret for at levere resultater af høj kvalitet. Med din positive energi og engagerede tilgang bidrager du til en kultur, hvor samarbejde og løbende forbedringer er i fokus, og hvor vi skaber værdi på tværs af organisationen.




Du kan forvente mindre rejseaktivitet (ca. 10-15 dage årligt) mellem vores danske lokationer i København, Ikast og Vejle, hvor du vil samarbejde med kolleger på tværs af afdelinger og teams.

Du vil derfor komme til at arbejde med onboarding af datakilder, optimering af data pipelines, samt udvikling og opbygning af de centrale datamodeller, der anvendes til applikations- og analyseformål på tværs af virksomheden. Vi arbejder blandt andet med store mængder tidsseriedata og data med høj kompleksitet.

Velkommen til Digital Udvikling

Vi har en ledig stilling som Data Engineer i Digital Udvikling, nærmere bestemt i Dataplatformsteamet. Vi søger efter dig, der enten har nogle års erfaring som Data Engineer eller anden tilsvarende erfaring inden for dataområdet. Det vigtigste er, at du har interesse i at arbejde struktureret med data og gerne vil være en del af et team, der samarbejder og sparrer om opgaverne. Det er også en klar fordel, hvis du synes, det er spændende at arbejde med forskellige typer af data.

Dine nøgleopgaver bliver at:


Udvikle og vedligeholde dataløsninger i Azure Synapse 
Optimere ETL-processer og sørge for, at data er valide, pålidelige, opdaterede og tilgængelige for analyse og beslutningstagning 
Udvikle datamodeller i henhold til medallion lakehouse arkitektur, samt deltage i udviklingen af den fælles datamodel for HOFOR 
Skrive tests og monitorere data pipelines 
Sikre konsistens af data på tværs af forretningsområder – ofte i samarbejde med forretningen. 



Nogle af de nuværende teknologier vi arbejder med, er Azure Synapse, Azure SQL Server, Apache Spark, Delta Lake, Python mv. Vi er i øjeblikket i gang med et pilotprojekt i Microsoft Fabric, som vi fremover vil arbejde videre med. Det mest centrale for os er dog ikke hvilken teknologi der anvendes, men om løsningerne er robuste, skalérbare og kan driftes. Derudover er omdrejningspunktet for arbejdet med dataløsningerne, at de så vidt muligt bør overholde strukturen i den fælles datamodel for HOFOR. Denne model er udviklet og beskrevet i samarbejde med forretningen, og sikrer at der findes en klar definition af centrale begreber.

Vi arbejder agilt og med mange forskellige teknologier

Vi arbejder agilt i et SCRUM-team, der udvikler og drifter data- og integrationsløsninger som understøtter forretningsbehovene internt i HOFOR og hos vores eksterne samarbejdspartnere. Da vi ikke kun udvikler løsninger, men også står for driften, er DevOps en central del af tankegangen i teamet. Vi udvikler, tester og deployer løsninger vha. Azure Devops og sørger for løbende opdatering, konfiguration og monitorering i Azure. Da vi følger DevOps tankegangen er deployment af løsninger automatiseret via pipelines og IaC. 

Vi forventer derfor, at du har:


Solid erfaring med datatransformation/ETL
Erfaring med Python/Pyspark og SQL 
Erfaring med DevOps, Git og CI/CD 
Kendskab til medallion lakehouse arkitektur 
Erfaring med at tænke drift og videreudvikling ind løsningsdesignet 
Et agilt mindset og evnen til at forstå forretningskrav og omsætte disse til løsninger 



Vi glæder os til at byde dig velkommen

Som vores nye kollega bliver du en del af sektionen Digital Udvikling, der hører til i området Digitalisering & IT, som består af ca. 160 medarbejdere. Sektionen har ansvaret for udvikling, drift og vedligeholdelse af en række løsninger i HOFOR og består pt. af 17 specialister og ledere.

Du kan se frem til at blive en del af en virksomhed, hvor viden og faglighed værdsættes. Du kommer til at indgå i et åbent og uformelt arbejdsmiljø med engagerede og dygtige kolleger.

Som leder af vores afdeling, Data & Analytics (D&A), får du en helt central rolle i at realisere vores visioner om værdiskabende dataanvendelse.

Giv mening: Skab en tydelig vision for data i Velliv

Velliv er 100% kundeejet, og vores strategiske retning fokuserer på at sætte kunderne i centrum gennem datadrevne beslutninger. Din rolle bliver at sikre, at data bruges til at levere præcise og værdifulde løsninger for både interne og eksterne kunder. Vi har allerede sat ambitiøse mål om øget digitalisering, automatisering og effektiv udnyttelse af Cloud-services. Dit arbejde vil derfor have en direkte effekt på Vellivs konkurrencekraft og vores kunders oplevelse gennem brug af AI og mere traditionelle Analytics-værktøjer.

Skab udvikling: Led transformationen

Data & Analytics er en tværorganisatorisk enhed, hvor du leder et team af pt. 9 dygtige medarbejdere. Afdelingen skal organiseres i forretningsnære teams med dedikerede enheder på tværs af værdikæden for Velliv, og en vigtig opgave for dig bliver at sikre, at vi sætter det rigtige hold og skaber en stærk kultur, der kan drive vores dataambitioner fremad.

Du vil være ansvarlig for:


Personaleledelsen for Data & Analytics og at sikre, at teamet har de rette kompetencer til at lykkes i en fremtid præget af øget dataanvendelse og AI
At etablere forretningsnære teams på tværs af Velliv
At genere indsigter og guide forretningsstrategien gennem ’thought leadership’ for udnyttelse af data
Samarbejdet med it- og forretningsinteressenter for at tilpasse udviklingsindsatsen til forretningen, f.eks. onboarding af nye systemer og sikring af robust dataarkitektur og systemtilstand
Input på det overordnede D&A ressourceestimat og budget, koordinering af tværfaglige teams med resten af forretningen og forankring af dataområdet som en strategisk prioritet


Sæt retning: Vær en visionær, stærk faglig og forretningsdrevet leder

Du bliver ansvarlig for at fastlægge og kommunikere en klar retning for, hvor Velliv skal hen med data og analytics. Din naturlige autoritet og evne til at skabe samarbejde på tværs gør dig til en dygtig leder, der sikrer fremdrift og resultater. Du skaber tillid gennem åbenhed og struktur, og du motiverer dine omgivelser ved at sætte ambitiøse, men realistiske mål. Med en jordnær og relations-orienteret tilgang bliver du den, der skaber det fundament, vi skal bruge for at blive endnu mere datadrevne.

As a Data Engineer at one of Europe’s fastest-growing consultancies, you will:


Solve complex challenges for Danish and international companies across industries

Design and build scalable ETL pipelines to support our clients’ data integration and transformation needs
Use cutting-edge tools and technologies like Databricks and Fabric to create meaningful solutions to our clients
Leverage IaC to provision resources in modern data lakehouses
Develop data models and architectures that enable efficient querying, reporting and analysis for complex organisations
Engage in cross-functional teams to ensure data systems are aligned with business objectives and drive value

What We’re Looking For

We want someone who is not only skilled but also committed to personal and professional growth. To thrive in this role, you’ll need:


A master’s degree and at least 3 years of experience as a data engineer or a similar role
Ideally, hands-on experience with Databricks, Fabric and the wider Azure ecosystem for Data & AI
A firm theoretical foundation for data modelling and data architecture paired with practical experience

We offer you

The opportunity to work in a diverse and international environment with an informal culture, a flat hierarchy, in which we cooperate across business areas and levels. You will be working with some of the most talented and experienced consultants, and you will become part of a value-driven company, where our values; Integrity, Together, Joy, Curious and Can do are the corner stones in everything we do.

We care about results, not methodologies. But first and foremost, we care about people and how we can constantly challenge each other to become better. To do better. Your background is less important to us than your ability to create results, to create change. We prize excellence and ingenuity but know that both must be grounded in reality. The reality of making our clients ready for the future.

Advansor is looking for a Student Helper - Business Intelligence to become part of a successful company driven by climate actions.




The Student Helper should be able to work approximately 2 days per week. The total number of working hours can also be spread over more than 2 days, but the exact working schedule will be planned on an ongoing basis.




Your role

The Controlling department at Advansor acts as support function for management, providing data for decision-making.




You will participate in project work related to data management, governance and implementation of new systems in co-operation with IT and Accounting. This also means that you will cooperate with departments across the entire organisation.




Your main tasks will include:

Play a role in our efforts on data governance
Participate in securing Optimal use of data to support business strategies
Analyses and reports, including creation and updating reports and dashboards in PowerBI
Participate in project work on data governance and business intelligence
Secure that data is structured, accessible and easy to understand for technical and non-technical colleagues
Participate in the development and implementation of new governance structure, securing correct collection, structuring and use of data
Work with different data models and data protection as well as participating in practical data tasks
Securing that all data efforts are connected to the strategic targets of the company




What does the position require from you?

You are probably studying Cand. Merc. BI or Cand. Merc. IT, but it is not a requirement. You are fluent in English as you will be working with colleagues of many different nationalities.




In order to succeed in the position, you must be curious about how things work and have the desire to learn new things. It is only positive if you are critical and open to ask questions – better too many than too few.




The tasks you will handle require some knowledge about PowerBI. You don’t have to be an expert, but you must be willing to learn. In general, you are expected to take responsibility for own learning.




When working in the Controlling department, no two days are the same. Unplanned tasks will always come up, so you should be comfortable with handling sudden changes in priorities.




Knowledge to DAX will be an advantage but is not a requirement.




We offer

As part of Team Advansor, you will get to work with more than 350 competent colleagues of more than 35 different nationalities and join us in our mission: to design and produce the world’s best sustainable climate solutions. You will become part of a highly ambitious company that values a good working environment, diversity, and teamwork.




The company is located in Brabrand close to E45 with good access and within walking distance to the bus stop.




If you are interested in the position, please send your application and CV in English online through our website. We aim for a start date mid-February, but it is not a prerequisite for employment that you will be able to start exactly then.




Please contact Malene Birck Jensen, Operation Controller at mbj@advansor.com if you have any questions about the position or Advansor as a workplace.




We look forward to receiving your application.




Sustainable CO2 climate solutions

As a market-leading manufacturer, we have designed and produced more than 16,000 CO2 systems for sustainable commercial and industrial cooling and heating around the world since 2006.




Many people associate CO2 with global warming. We’re cool with that. Literally. Because CO2 is the most climate-friendly refrigerant: It is non-toxic, non-flammable and does not harm our drinking water. That is why we are ’cool with CO2’.

Data is an incredibly important asset to our organisation, and now is your chance to join our digital business transformation and contribute to shaping the future of data in Lind Capital. 




Who we are 

At Lind Capital, we take a different approach to trading. We're a team of 20+ market specialists and analytical thinkers who collaborate to combine technical expertise with market understanding. With no external investors, we are free to focus on making the best possible trades using quantitative models. 




Data in Lind Capital 

Data is central to Lind Capital’s success and key to our future growth, and therefore we are looking to expand our resources within the area. You become part of our international technology team which currently consists of 8 software engineers, data engineers and data scientists. On a daily basis, you will be working in one of our cross-functional squads of professionals who enjoy solving complex problems together in our effort to advance on our tech and data journey. 




The job 

The main tasks of your team are to develop and maintain solutions solving complex business problems by utilizing vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. As our new Data Engineer, you will play an important role in preparing and serving data for both trading applications, analytics and our machine learning models. Also, you will play an important role in the development of data solutions and data usage at large.  

If you are skilled and motivated to build solutions to bring raw data into actionable output, you will be able to make a big impact in our organization.  

More specifically, your tasks will include: 

Collaborate closely with data scientists, software and ML engineers in a cross-functional setting identifying and facilitating both analytics and ML requirements for data
Design, develop and maintain batch and streaming data pipelines from end-to-end.  
Enable both batch and live serving of data for applications, analytics and ML models. 
Build data quality monitoring tools and improving pipeline observability. 
Develop our data management framework. 
Build and maintain our infrastructure in AWS using infrastructure-as-code tools.  
Contribute to our data strategy and promote good engineering practices.  




You make the difference 

Technical capabilities are required, but personality makes the difference. We aim for a cooperative work environment with a high level of knowledge sharing. A work environment where everybody assumes personal responsibility, and where teamwork and communication skills are essential. 

The trading strategies we pursue are all based on a complex combination of tech, data, numbers, and market know-how. This means your ability to go beyond your comfort zone and engage with experts in other areas is paramount to our success. 

You are a team player and have an open-minded attitude. You can communicate ideas and technical topics honestly and clearly – also to non-experts – while respecting the views of others on the team. You are eager to understand and find solutions, allowing you to quickly adapt to changing situations and come up with new ideas.  

We're looking for someone who brings: 

Clean and efficient Python code (experience with other programming languages is a plus). 
Practical experience in creating and maintaining data intensive solutions from a similar role. 
Experience with orchestration frameworks like Apache Airflow. 
Experience with containerization frameworks like Docker. 
Experience with SQL and NoSQL DBMS for both transactional and analytical workloads. 
Experience with Big-data solutions for distributed storage and computing like Hadoop or Spark. 
Familiarity with cloud providers (preferably AWS), time series data, CI/CD pipelines, GIT and/or infrastructure as code.  




We encourage you to apply even if you don't meet all the listed qualifications. 




Life at the office 

We bring together talented people from diverse backgrounds. You will become part of an informal and diverse work environment where we focus on creating results together, and where you will be empowered to make decisions. We generally dislike meetings, PowerPoints, politics, and committees, but prefer to look at the code or the chart together over the screen for a few minutes and make the decisions there and then. 

We value work-life balance and support our team members' personal and professional commitments. While our dynamic work environment may require additional work hours, we ensure flexibility works both ways - whether you need time for personal appointments, family responsibilities, or other important life events. Our focus is on results and impact rather than rigid schedules. 




The practical stuff 

This position is based in Aarhus, Denmark. We operate in English and welcome international candidates. 

Start date: As soon as possible. 

To apply, please submit your CV and motivation letter. 

Applications will be processed on a rolling basis.

Brænder du for at arbejde med komplekse opgaver?

Så er du måske én af de softwareudviklere, som vi er på jagt efter!

Hos EG Silkeborg Data har vi en ambition om at være den offentlige sektors mest værdifulde samarbejdspartner. Vi udvikler og varetager driften af produkter inden for bl.a. Løn, Økonomi, Medarbejderadministration, Organisation og Ledelsesinformation til kunder i det offentlige Danmark. Når vi gang på gang leverer unikke kvalitetsløsninger til kommuner og regioner, skyldes det, at vi er engagerede og alle brænder for at fastholde og udvikle det danske velfærdssystem gennem digitalisering.

Byg Bro mellem Data og Beslutninger

Medarbejderne i de offentlige institutioner forventer at få den rette løn til den rette tid, og det er vores ansvar at sikre at det sker. Lønberegning er komplekst, så høj kvalitet i vores løsninger og i vores leverancer er vigtig, for at sikre en høj kundetilfredshed. Data & BI Teamet bidrager til at skabe det bedste datagrundlag for at hjælpe vores kunder med at tage de rigtige beslutninger.

Alt data bliver trukket ud fra vores forskellige kildesystemer, og det ender i DB2 eller Oracle tabeller. Vi samler det hele sammen i vores Data Warehouse, hvor vi bearbejder og strukturerer dataene, så de kan præsenteres enten på sd.dk/sddw (SAS) eller via vores IBM-Cognos løsning som læser data fra vores ms-sqlserver.

Du kan se frem til en dagligdag med opgaver som:


Drift/overvågning af dataflow til DW og BI - primært decentralt, men også Host.
3. level teknisk support (kundehenvendelser, som vores kolleger i support har brug for hjælp til).
Bug fixing fra DataInput til DataOutput.
Opdatere sikkerhed/servicepacks/hot-fixes på vores MS-Server og SAS installation.
Fejlsøgning/Datadetektiv.
Analyse og opgavebeskrivelse ifm. nye kundekrav/-opgaver.
Udvikling på og af vores eksisterende platform og teknologistak.
Datastrategi: hvor skal vi hen på længere sigt.
Forvaltning og vedligehold af en platform med stor kompleksitet.
Sikre høj kvalitet i løsningen gennem reviews og test.


Du kommer med viden om og erfaring med én eller flere af nedenstående kompetencer i værktøjskassen.

Vi forventer du har erfaring med:


Microsoft SQL server.
SSIS.
SQL Performance.


Derudover vil det være en fordel, men ikke et krav, hvis du har kendskab til:


Visual Studio.
TFS/GIT.
SAS backend.
Linux.
Oracle queries.
Database: Oracle og DB2.
DB2 queries AQT.
Forståelse af Data arkitektur, begreber som Fact/Dimensioner, Star-schema og Snowflake.


For at blive en succes i rollen, er det vigtigt, at du…


Har stærke analytiske evner, og har mod på at sætte dig ind i et komplekst område.
Er god til at kommunikere med kollegerne omkring dig, hvad enten det f.eks. er en forretningsudvikler en kollega fra support- eller salgsteamet.
Kan samarbejde i et globalt setup med kolleger i både Danmark og Polen, så det er vigtigt, at du er flydende i engelsk, både mundtligt og skriftligt.
Og ikke mindst, at du er en teamspiller, der byder ind med energi, humør og viljen til at lykkes.


Hvad kan du forvente af os?


Fleksible arbejdstider, hvor du selv har mulighed for at planlægge din arbejdsdag.
Mulighed for hjemmearbejdsplads og hjemmearbejde efter behov eller arbejde på vores kontor primært i Aarhus.
Mulighed for at sætte dit fingeraftryk på metoder og løsninger.
Stillingen er i en spændende virksomhed, der er i en rivende udvikling.
Attraktiv frokost-, frugt og kaffe/the-ordning.
Aktiv personaleforening der arrangerer gode sociale events
Sundhedsforsikring.
In-house klinik med f.eks. fysioterapeut som supplement til sundhedsforsikring.

Vi udvikler fremtidens vertikale software, der påvirker kunderne og samfundet på en bæredygtig måde. Vi stræber altid efter at blive bedre: Vi er et dedikeret team af innovatører og problemløsere. Som en integreret del af vores kultur tager vi ansvar for vores bidrag til kunderne, hinanden og det samfund, vi lever i.

Som BI Developer hos DK Company bliver du en vigtig del af vores BI-team, der arbejder på at skabe robuste og brugervenlige dataløsninger. Du tager ansvar for at udvikle rapporter og dashboards i Power BI og sikrer, at forretningens behov omsættes til konkrete løsninger med høj værdi.




Din rolle er både praktisk og analytisk, og du vil arbejde tæt sammen med kolleger i hele organisationen for at levere dataløsninger, der gør en forskel. Samtidig har du mulighed for at videreudvikle dine kompetencer gennem samarbejde med erfarne kolleger og adgang til de nyeste teknologier.




En typisk dag kan starte med teamets standup-møde, hvor dagens opgaver prioriteres. Herefter arbejder du med at designe og optimere Power BI-rapporter, der både har et solidt teknisk fundament og en intuitiv brugerflade. Du samarbejder med Business Partners, Data Engineers og øvrige BI Developere for at sikre, at løsningerne lever op til forretningens krav, og du bidrager til at forbedre eksisterende rapporter gennem performanceoptimering og feedback fra brugerne.




Ansvarsområder og fokus i rollen

Udvikle og vedligeholde Power BI-rapporter og dashboards, der er intuitive og brugervenlige, og som skaber værdi for forretningen.
Opbygge og optimere datamodeller med fokus på præcision, performance og brugervenlighed.
Supportere og uddanne brugere, så de kan få det fulde udbytte af Power BI-løsningerne, og yde løbende teknisk support ved behov.
Tage ejerskab for dine løsninger og sikre deres stabilitet og kvalitet over tid.
Samarbejde tæt med Business Partners, Data Engineers og øvrige BI Developere for at forstå forretningens krav og sikre, at dine leverancer opfylder behovene.
Deltage i forbedringsarbejde ved at identificere optimeringsmuligheder og løbende justere eksisterende rapporter og løsninger.




Om hvordan du lykkes i rollen

For at lykkes som BI Developer hos DK Company kræves en kombination af teknisk ekspertise, forretningsforståelse og stærke samarbejdsevner. Du har erfaring med Power BI og SQL og er fortrolig med at arbejde med datamodellering og rapportering.




Du har en analytisk tilgang og evner at omsætte komplekse data til handlingsorienterede indsigter, der skaber værdi for forretningen. Samtidig motiveres du af at samarbejde med kolleger på tværs af organisationen og tager ansvar for at levere løsninger af høj kvalitet.




Du har en naturlig nysgerrighed og en lyst til konstant at forbedre dig, lære nye teknologier og udforske innovative måder at arbejde med data på. Din stræben efter at udvikle dine færdigheder gør dig til en værdifuld del af teamet, og du bidrager til en kultur, hvor vi hele tiden arbejder på at blive bedre.




Tre vigtige kvalifikationer for rollen

Teknisk ekspertise: Erfaring med Power BI og DAX samt forståelse for datamodellering og rapportering. Erfaring med SQL er en fordel.
Forretningsforståelse: Du har en stærk evne til at forstå og omsætte forretningsbehov til dataløsninger. Erfaring fra modebranchen eller tilsvarende dynamiske og sæsonprægede brancher er en klar fordel.
Samarbejdsevner: Stærke kommunikationsevner og evnen til at samarbejde på tværs af teams og interessenter.




Din nysgerrighed og ambition om at udvikle dig sikrer, at dine løsninger ikke blot skaber værdi i dag, men også er fremtidssikrede. Du tager ansvar for dine opgaver og arbejder struktureret for at levere resultater af høj kvalitet. Med din positive energi og engagerede tilgang bidrager du til en kultur, hvor samarbejde og løbende forbedringer er i fokus, og hvor vi skaber værdi på tværs af organisationen.

Du vil derfor komme til at arbejde med onboarding af datakilder, optimering af data pipelines, samt udvikling og opbygning af de centrale datamodeller, der anvendes til applikations- og analyseformål på tværs af virksomheden. Vi arbejder blandt andet med store mængder tidsseriedata og data med høj kompleksitet.

Velkommen til Digital Udvikling

Vi har en ledig stilling som Data Engineer i Digital Udvikling, nærmere bestemt i Dataplatformsteamet. Vi søger efter dig, der enten har nogle års erfaring som Data Engineer eller anden tilsvarende erfaring inden for dataområdet. Det vigtigste er, at du har interesse i at arbejde struktureret med data og gerne vil være en del af et team, der samarbejder og sparrer om opgaverne. Det er også en klar fordel, hvis du synes, det er spændende at arbejde med forskellige typer af data.

Dine nøgleopgaver bliver at:


Udvikle og vedligeholde dataløsninger i Azure Synapse 
Optimere ETL-processer og sørge for, at data er valide, pålidelige, opdaterede og tilgængelige for analyse og beslutningstagning 
Udvikle datamodeller i henhold til medallion lakehouse arkitektur, samt deltage i udviklingen af den fælles datamodel for HOFOR 
Skrive tests og monitorere data pipelines 
Sikre konsistens af data på tværs af forretningsområder – ofte i samarbejde med forretningen. 



Nogle af de nuværende teknologier vi arbejder med, er Azure Synapse, Azure SQL Server, Apache Spark, Delta Lake, Python mv. Vi er i øjeblikket i gang med et pilotprojekt i Microsoft Fabric, som vi fremover vil arbejde videre med. Det mest centrale for os er dog ikke hvilken teknologi der anvendes, men om løsningerne er robuste, skalérbare og kan driftes. Derudover er omdrejningspunktet for arbejdet med dataløsningerne, at de så vidt muligt bør overholde strukturen i den fælles datamodel for HOFOR. Denne model er udviklet og beskrevet i samarbejde med forretningen, og sikrer at der findes en klar definition af centrale begreber.

Vi arbejder agilt og med mange forskellige teknologier

Vi arbejder agilt i et SCRUM-team, der udvikler og drifter data- og integrationsløsninger som understøtter forretningsbehovene internt i HOFOR og hos vores eksterne samarbejdspartnere. Da vi ikke kun udvikler løsninger, men også står for driften, er DevOps en central del af tankegangen i teamet. Vi udvikler, tester og deployer løsninger vha. Azure Devops og sørger for løbende opdatering, konfiguration og monitorering i Azure. Da vi følger DevOps tankegangen er deployment af løsninger automatiseret via pipelines og IaC. 

Vi forventer derfor, at du har:


Solid erfaring med datatransformation/ETL
Erfaring med Python/Pyspark og SQL 
Erfaring med DevOps, Git og CI/CD 
Kendskab til medallion lakehouse arkitektur 
Erfaring med at tænke drift og videreudvikling ind løsningsdesignet 
Et agilt mindset og evnen til at forstå forretningskrav og omsætte disse til løsninger 



Vi glæder os til at byde dig velkommen

Som vores nye kollega bliver du en del af sektionen Digital Udvikling, der hører til i området Digitalisering & IT, som består af ca. 160 medarbejdere. Sektionen har ansvaret for udvikling, drift og vedligeholdelse af en række løsninger i HOFOR og består pt. af 17 specialister og ledere.

Vi er stolte af at kalde os selv et professionelt team med høj faglighed og et godt sammenhold, og vi sætter pris på sparring og samarbejde. Du kan se frem til at blive en del af en virksomhed, hvor viden og faglighed værdsættes. Du kommer til at indgå i et åbent og uformelt arbejdsmiljø med engagerede og dygtige kolleger.

Som leder af vores afdeling, Data & Analytics (D&A), får du en helt central rolle i at realisere vores visioner om værdiskabende dataanvendelse.

Giv mening: Skab en tydelig vision for data i Velliv

Velliv er 100% kundeejet, og vores strategiske retning fokuserer på at sætte kunderne i centrum gennem datadrevne beslutninger. Din rolle bliver at sikre, at data bruges til at levere præcise og værdifulde løsninger for både interne og eksterne kunder. Vi har allerede sat ambitiøse mål om øget digitalisering, automatisering og effektiv udnyttelse af Cloud-services. Dit arbejde vil derfor have en direkte effekt på Vellivs konkurrencekraft og vores kunders oplevelse gennem brug af AI og mere traditionelle Analytics-værktøjer.

Skab udvikling: Led transformationen

Data & Analytics er en tværorganisatorisk enhed, hvor du leder et team af pt. 9 dygtige medarbejdere. Afdelingen skal organiseres i forretningsnære teams med dedikerede enheder på tværs af værdikæden for Velliv, og en vigtig opgave for dig bliver at sikre, at vi sætter det rigtige hold og skaber en stærk kultur, der kan drive vores dataambitioner fremad.

Du vil være ansvarlig for:


Personaleledelsen for Data & Analytics og at sikre, at teamet har de rette kompetencer til at lykkes i en fremtid præget af øget dataanvendelse og AI
At etablere forretningsnære teams på tværs af Velliv
At genere indsigter og guide forretningsstrategien gennem ’thought leadership’ for udnyttelse af data
Samarbejdet med it- og forretningsinteressenter for at tilpasse udviklingsindsatsen til forretningen, f.eks. onboarding af nye systemer og sikring af robust dataarkitektur og systemtilstand
Input på det overordnede D&A ressourceestimat og budget, koordinering af tværfaglige teams med resten af forretningen og forankring af dataområdet som en strategisk prioritet


Sæt retning: Vær en visionær, stærk faglig og forretningsdrevet leder

Du bliver ansvarlig for at fastlægge og kommunikere en klar retning for, hvor Velliv skal hen med data og analytics. Din naturlige autoritet og evne til at skabe samarbejde på tværs gør dig til en dygtig leder, der sikrer fremdrift og resultater. Du skaber tillid gennem åbenhed og struktur, og du motiverer dine omgivelser ved at sætte ambitiøse, men realistiske mål. Med en jordnær og relations-orienteret tilgang bliver du den, der skaber det fundament, vi skal bruge for at blive endnu mere datadrevne.

Kvalifikationer og personlige egenskaber:


Minimum 5 års erfaring inden for datamanagement, analytics og rapportering.
Erfaring med programledelse, interessenthåndtering og/eller forandringsledelse.
Kendskab til Cloud-baserede platforme, services og værktøjer (Snowflake er vores strategiske platform).
Relevant uddannelse på kandidat-niveau – gerne med en teknisk profil.
Erfaring med data og compliance fra en reguleret industri samt AI er en fordel.


Personligt er du analytisk, struktureret og en dygtig kommunikator – både over for dine medarbejdere og ledelsen. Du forstår at oversætte komplekse problemstillinger til løsninger, som skaber værdi for forretningen. Du holder af at udvikle dine medarbejdere og være i dialog med forretningen.

Plads til at være menneske – plads til at være dig

Velliv er to år i træk blevet kåret til at have branchens bedste medarbejderimage og har gennem flere år vundet prisen som Årets Pensionsselskab. Hos os bliver du mødt med åbne arme, og vi gør os umage for, at du kommer godt fra start og hurtigt falder til.

Du har mulighed for at melde dig ind i ”Klub Velliv” og deltage i aktiviteter inden for sport, mad, hobby og kultur for os medarbejdere og vores børn. I det hele taget kan du forvente en kultur, hvor vi lever vores tre kerneværdier: Optimisme, Ordentlighed og Omsorg.

I Velliv skal der være plads til at være menneske – plads til at være dig.

What You’ll Do

As a Data Engineer at one of Europe’s fastest-growing consultancies, you will:


Solve complex challenges for Danish and international companies across industries
Work side by side with skilled and experienced colleagues and clients, many of whom have several years of experience and backgrounds in executive positions in other companies
Design and build scalable ETL pipelines to support our clients’ data integration and transformation needs
Use cutting-edge tools and technologies like Databricks and Fabric to create meaningful solutions to our clients
Leverage IaC to provision resources in modern data lakehouses
Develop data models and architectures that enable efficient querying, reporting and analysis for complex organisations
Engage in cross-functional teams to ensure data systems are aligned with business objectives and drive value
Drive clarity not only around the “how”, but also the “why” for data engineering solutions


What We’re Looking For

We want someone who is not only skilled but also committed to personal and professional growth. To thrive in this role, you’ll need:


A master’s degree and at least 3 years of experience as a data engineer or a similar role
Ideally, hands-on experience with Databricks, Fabric and the wider Azure ecosystem for Data & AI
A firm theoretical foundation for data modelling and data architecture paired with practical experience
Familiarity with Git version control, DevOps, MLOps pipelines, CI/CD and test automation

This includes getting started on certifying as well as important advisory fundamentals, which we consider important to ensure full impact at our clients in every assignment.

We offer you

The opportunity to work in a diverse and international environment with an informal culture, a flat hierarchy, in which we cooperate across business areas and levels. You will be working with some of the most talented and experienced consultants, and you will become part of a value-driven company, where our values; Integrity, Together, Joy, Curious and Can do are the corner stones in everything we do.

We care about results, not methodologies. But first and foremost, we care about people and how we can constantly challenge each other to become better. To do better. Your background is less important to us than your ability to create results, to create change. We prize excellence and ingenuity but know that both must be grounded in reality. The reality of making our clients ready for the future.

A workplace in the heart of Copenhagen, Meldahlsgade 5, Copenhagen V.

GroupM er verdens største bureaugruppe inden for digital markedsføring og kommunikation - med branchens dygtigste og mest passionerede specialister. Vores Tracking & Analytics-team søger en digital profil, der kan hjælpe vores kunder med at sikre et stærkt fundament for deres digitale kampagner. Er du den vi leder efter?

En af dine primære opgaver som praktikant i Tracking & Analytics, vil være oprettelse og løbende tilpasning af digitale kampagner for både nationale og internationale kunder i Campaign Manager eller Adform, som er vores to primære ad-servers. Du vil derudover også få mulighed for at dykke ned i site tracking for vores kunder via bl.a Google Tag Manger og Google Analytics.

Du vil gennem dit praktikforløb få grundig oplæring i Googles platforme (primært Campaign Manager, Google Tag Manger og Google Analytics), samt få en dybdegående praktisk erfaring hertil.

Som praktikant i Tracking & Analytics får du mulighed for at berøre rollen som den gode konsulent både eksternt og internt, samt tilegne dig flair for den mere tekniske del af kampagneeksekveringen.

Om teamet

Tracking & Analytics består pt. af 8 personer, hvoraf 4 startede som praktikanter i huset.

Vi er et lille team i en stor organisation, hvorfor det er vigtigt, at du er en holdspiller og samtidigt trives i en uformel og humoristisk omgangstone.

”Jeg startede selv som praktikant i Tracking & Analytics, hvor jeg efterfølgende blev ansat. Jeg fik tidligt i praktikforløbet stort ansvar og en stor kontaktflade i huset, som gjorde at læringskurven var ekstremt stejl – og stadig er. Tracking & Analytics er en vigtig spiller i huset, så man kan hurtigt mærke ens værdi som praktikant. Derudover er det et suverænt team.” - Amalie Thomasen, Senior Tracking & Analytics Specialist

Introduktion af ONLINECITY.IO og GatewayAPI

GatewayAPI er en del af ONLINECITY.IO gruppen, som har kontorer i Danmark og Tyskland.




ONLINECITY.IO ejer, udvikler og driver en række IT-platforme, som alle har det til fælles, at de består af moderne, webbaserede brugergrænseflader, stærke og skalérbare tekniske fundamenter, samt har højt fokus på automatisering og selvbetjening. Vi servicerer alt fra helt små virksomheder til de allerstørste. GatewayAPI er den ældste og største del af forretningen og er blevet en af Nordens største SMS gateways.




Om jobbet og rollen

Til vores kontor i København søger vi en kvalitetsbevidst Python Engineer, der har ambitioner og interesse for Python som sprog og sætter en ære i at skrive gode tests. Du kommer til at arbejde på vores messaging platform i bred forstand, alt efter interesse og kvalifikationer. Det kan f.eks. være selve motoren med udviklingen af nye kommunikationsformer såsom RCS eller backend-delen af vores administrationsinterfaces til kunder og medarbejdere.




Vi er et lille team med høje ambitioner om at skrive moderne, god Python kode. Vi arbejder med typehints, linting, async og skriver mindst lige så mange linjer testkode som produktionskode. Vi kan lave adskillige pull requests og releases samme dag, stort set uden at introducere nye fejl.




Vi arbejder med lige dele strategisk fremsynethed, fokus på vores kunders behov og fremtidssikring via fokus på best practice såsom løbende refaktorering, brug af frameworks og testbarhed.




Dine kvalifikationer

Vi forventer, at du på forhånd har stærk erfaring med moderne Python og frameworks som f.eks. FastAPI, Flask eller Django.

Derudover håber vi at finde en kandidat, der har følgende:

Relevant uddannelse som f.eks. Softwareudvikler eller Datamatiker

Erfaring med backend og API udvikling
Erfaring med SQL database
En stærk forståelse af moderne teknologier, hvor følgende er en fordel at have kendskab til:
FastAPI
SQLAlchemy
RabbitMQ
Databaser som PostgeSQL og Redis
Python type hints
Async Python udvikling
htmx
Containerization og kubernetes







Dine primære ansvarsområder:

Udvikling af GatewayAPI platformen med resten af teamet
Løbende QA af dine kollegers arbejde
Ad-hoc problemløsning og teknisk support i særlige tilfælde
Indgå i samarbejde med andre teams inklusiv samspil mellem backend og frontend udvikling

Dine kompetencer:

Du har minimum 4 års erhvervserfaring med Python udvikling, ideelt i mange af de ovenstående teknologier
Forståelse for god softwarearkitektur
Du er en teamplayer, der sætter pris på gode processer
Du kan skrive og tale dansk og engelsk flydende

Vi kan tilbyde dig: 

Foruden at blive en del af en spændende og hurtigtvoksende it-virksomhed med et stærkt fællesskab hvor kulturen og værdier som Enkelthed, Ambition, Inklusion og Loyalitet er omdrejningspunkt for vores forretning og omdømme, tilbyder vi bl.a.:




Løn efter kvalifikationer
Privat sundhedssikring
Overenskomstreguleret ansættelsesforhold (Industriens Funktionæroverenskomst)
Autonomi med fleksible arbejdstider/flekstid med frihed under ansvar
Pensionsplan
Frokostordning 
Hjemmearbejde i rimeligt omfang (det øvrige team er oftest på kontoret 4 dage om ugen)
