About Salesforce

We’re Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way. And, we empower you to be a Trailblazer, too — driving your performance and career growth, charting new paths, and improving the state of the world. If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good – you’ve come to the right place.

Tableau Research is an industrial research team focused on Tableau’s mission of helping people see and understand data. We actively work to be a source of new and inspiring product and technology directions, generating ideas that influence, drive, or significantly change what Tableau delivers to customers. We are also active members of the academic community, where we regularly publish and participate in top-tier conferences and journals.

The vision for Tableau Research is to operate as a world-class industry research lab where we partner with internal teams and academia to foster innovation and serve as thought leaders, advancing the start of the art in data and analytics.

What you’ll be doing…

A Tableau Research internship typically consists of a project that is mutually discussed and agreed upon between the intern and their mentor. The goal of the project is to help further the intern’s research career and inspire Tableau & Salesforce with new ideas for future product roadmaps. A research internship also provides excellent opportunities for exploring industry research, gaining insights into product development, and publishing work at top academic conferences.

As a research intern you will work closely with a mentor who is a member of Tableau Research. You will typically meet daily with your mentor to coordinate, plan, and help set expectations. You will be asked to present and provide updates a few times at our team meetings. Research typically involves designing and/or prototyping, along with possible user studies. You will be expected to create a final presentation and write-up of the project. Often, the project evolves into co-authoring an academic paper that could extend beyond the internship period.

Research topics include visual analytics, conversational analytics, semantics & data preparation, human-computer & multi-modal interaction, machine learning, AI/LLMs.

Who you are…


Aligned with our mission. Your research passion aligns with Tableau’s mission to help people see and understand data.
You are a PhD student in good academic standing with at least a couple years of research and publishing experience at high-quality conference and journal venues. In the past, interns have published at venues such as VIS, EuroVis, and IUI, for example. Other venues could include CHI, CSCW, UIST, IUI, AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and NeurIPS. Having previous internship experience is a plus, but not a requirement.
Highly technical. If your project involves prototyping, you have strong technical skills to prototype in a language of your choice, e.g., D3/JavaScript, Python, R, C++, C#, Java, Go. If your project is study-focused, you have strong experience with setting up user studies, collecting, analyzing, and distilling qualitative and quantitative data. If your project is oriented towards statistics, you have strong computational skills and experience in statistical modeling, including data wrangling, model validation, and uncertainty assessment. If your project involves prototyping user interfaces, you have a portfolio of UX / interaction / visualization design examples.
An effective communicator. You have clear written and oral communication skills.
Demonstrates strong executive skills. You are diligent, take personal responsibility for your work, and manage your time effectively. You excel at balancing independent work with meeting deadlines, and you prioritize tasks efficiently to deliver high-quality results on time.

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have an absolute love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem, and living inside a spreadsheet/data set to find the answer to any question.
Because you love data, you have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis. Experience with Marketing APIs, Big Query or other Cloud Data Warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.), ETL Tools (Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics) and/or Python are all pluses.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and have spent a minimum of 1 year working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.




What You’ll Do:

Reporting: With your expertise in Advanced Excel, SQL, Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools, you’ll be maintaining customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence, generating pivot tables and other visualizations that summarize thousands of lines of data. You should have experience in translating performance media metrics into coherent, digestible reports for client ad campaigns and be comfortable communicating via Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.
Strategy: You’ll be responsible for learning our clients’ businesses and aligning their media strategy with business goals as well as understanding advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to help guide media buying strategy. With a background in paid media and/or digital advertising, you understand concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue and are able to be engaged in discussions with clients to gain trust and shareholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.




Gupta Media is an office-first (with flexibility) organization and we are excited to have our team working together again
