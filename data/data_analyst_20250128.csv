You will be working directly with the senior stakeholders in the firm to understand what insights they are looking to gain, then build reports and dashboards using SQL and PowerBI.




Alongside this, you’ll spend the other half of your time analysing the ESG data and markets, looking for ways you can influence and impact the firm’s performance.




This is a relatively junior role, so while you may have some experience with PowerBI, Tableau or SSRS, this is an opportunity to develop those skills further and progress into a Senior position over the next few years.

Experimentation and Strategy:

Work closely with teams to provide insights that help craft strategies for future reporting and content creation.
Build measurement tests and implement data-driven strategies to optimize content performance.

Experience designing measurement tests and informal experimentation to inform content strategies, such as storytelling formats and story arcs.
A background in marketing, research, or consulting, with a focus on distilling insights from data.
Adept with social media platforms, including TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Twitch, and Discord, and their key performance indicators.

Simply Business is an online business insurance brokerage that specialises in one thing: protecting the businesses their customers are working hard to build. Since they started life in 2005, they have helped over three million small businesses and self-employed people find the protection that’s right for them, from builders to bakers and personal trainers. Their big idea was to reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible, while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that they believe small businesses and landlords are entitled to.




Their story - continued commitment to doing the right thing




2005 seems like a long time ago. Simply Business – a small company with a big idea. To transform the way that other small businesses could get the insurance that they need. To reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that small businesses are entitled to. To protect them from harm. To keep their livelihoods safe. And to do all this with the promise of positive service. Delivered by happy people, working flexibly, learning constantly. With a restlessly innovative spirit. Within a business committed to doing the right thing. All of the time.




As they've grown, they've tried hard to keep true to this. To ourselves, to their 800 strong team and to the 3.5m customers that they've served so far. And as they move forward, as they enter a big new market, as they grow responsibly, as they improve their products, as they offer their customers more of what they need, of what they deserve, they'll hold onto the focus of that small company with the big idea. Protecting and serving businesses across the UK and the US. From barbers to bakers, consultants to cleaners, they are the backbone of the economy.




And they'll continue to stand by them. Bit by bit helping their dreams grow, just like ours.

Particular focus will be on use cases that will help them drive operational efficiencies as the organization scales.

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that values diversity and emphasises personal well-being.

MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

YOUR ROLE

In the Data Analytics team you will ensure both the voice of the customer and CFO are represented in the room with hard evidence. As well as supporting exceptional customer experiences using data, you will help ensure every action we take is directly improving performance against your clients objectives.

As an Analyst, you will work under supervision to deliver projects within set deadlines, utilisng your strong hands on analytical capabilities. Your strengths in Python and SQL will ensure you can efficiently deliver robust analytics with guidance from your team.

Your experience with web and social analytics tools (GA / Adobe / Brandwatch / Sprinklr) and data visualisation tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker / etc) will enable you to uncover key insights across channels and create self-service dashboards.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for fresh graduates who meet the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Enrolled in a quantitative Master’s program (e.g. Business Intelligence Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2024 or spring/summer 2025
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights



Preferred Qualifications


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects
Ability to learn new systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, San Francisco Bay Area, or New York City. We are hiring these positions in Chicago, IL or Toronto, Ontario, Canada.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We believe that real estate is one of life’s great adventures. And, as we’ve helped Canadians navigate these uncharted waters, we’ve become the best real estate search platform in the country, and the leading marketplace in BC with an audience twice the size of our nearest rival.

We’ve done this by carefully assembling a team of great people who have great ideas. One of those genius-level ideas is to make REW quite simply the best place in the world to work - and we’d like your help to get there. Yup, really.

And that’s where you come in.

We’re searching for a hugely-motivated Data Analyst to help our Data Engineering Team better understand how our customers use our products, and - more importantly - to translate that understanding into insights that can transform our business.

A love of working with amazing people will be viewed as a plus, too.

Rocking the role.

Data is at the heart of everything we do at REW. Every day, our platform ingests feeds from dozens of sources to compile, composite and augment the listings that thousands of homeseekers search through in their quest for the perfect home.

But listings are only part of the puzzle. We also track market behaviour to help inform our own next steps and to empower the agents, landlords, and property developers who count on REW to give them an edge. And while we are awash in all this data, we sometimes risk losing sight of what works and what doesn’t.

That’s where we’d love your help, fellow adventurer.

You’d be joining a small team who are already evolving REW’s data platform, and act as a vital link between our platform and business stakeholders.

With a Great Role comes Great Responsibilities.

Present reports to technical and non-technical stakeholders

Data processing and modeling to derive business insights using a variety of quantitative analytical techniques
Collaborate with product development teams to provide insight to power new features and monitor their performance
Develop reports or data visualization tools for internal use to help support the REW's sales and marketing efforts
Participate in project planning and analysis as needed


Who you are is far more important than where you’ve been.

Qualifications.


Minimum of one year of professional experience with data analysis and big data tech stacks
At least one year of professional experience with Tableau or other data visualization tools such as PowerBI, and/or Google DataStudio
Bachelor of Computer Science, a similar technical degree, or have equivalent experience
Proficiency in SQL and Python (or a similar language for data processing) with exposure to other scripting or object-oriented programming languages
Strong experience in data modelling and quantitative analysis, plus data analysis concepts like data visualization, dashboard design and data mining


Who you are and your life at REW.


You are passionate about personal and professional growth, always seeking new knowledge and innovative technologies
You thrive on sharing insights and knowledge with peers to foster a culture of learning and continuous improvement
You can maintain a balance between independent work and teamwork, contributing positively to team dynamics and company culture
Analysis is in your DNA, enabling you to craft insightful and maintainable dashboards that tell and compelling story of the data for all stakeholders
You communicate technical designs and concepts with clarity, ensuring alignment and understanding across the team.
You are committed to continuous learning, staying up to date with the company’s products and features to drive and improve performance analytics
You are willing to work primarily in-office at our Vancouver location


What we can offer you.

In addition to competitive compensation, we provide a comprehensive benefits package, the best equipment for you to do your best work, and awesome perks and team events to keep you connected. Annual base salary for this role is $90,000 - $120,000 per year, dependant on experience.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for fresh graduates who meet the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements

Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals

Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights

Ability to learn new systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We believe that real estate is one of life’s great adventures. And, as we’ve helped Canadians navigate these uncharted waters, we’ve become the best real estate search platform in the country, and the leading marketplace in BC with an audience twice the size of our nearest rival.

We’ve done this by carefully assembling a team of great people who have great ideas. One of those genius-level ideas is to make REW quite simply the best place in the world to work - and we’d like your help to get there. Yup, really.

And that’s where you come in.

We’re searching for a hugely-motivated Data Analyst to help our Data Engineering Team better understand how our customers use our products, and - more importantly - to translate that understanding into insights that can transform our business.

A love of working with amazing people will be viewed as a plus, too.

Rocking the role.

Data is at the heart of everything we do at REW. Every day, our platform ingests feeds from dozens of sources to compile, composite and augment the listings that thousands of homeseekers search through in their quest for the perfect home.

But listings are only part of the puzzle. We also track market behaviour to help inform our own next steps and to empower the agents, landlords, and property developers who count on REW to give them an edge. And while we are awash in all this data, we sometimes risk losing sight of what works and what doesn’t.

That’s where we’d love your help, fellow adventurer.

You’d be joining a small team who are already evolving REW’s data platform, and act as a vital link between our platform and business stakeholders.

With a Great Role comes Great Responsibilities.

Collaborate with product development teams to provide insight to power new features and monitor their performance
Develop reports or data visualization tools for internal use to help support the REW's sales and marketing efforts
Participate in project planning and analysis as needed


Who you are is far more important than where you’ve been.

At least one year of professional experience with Tableau or other data visualization tools such as PowerBI, and/or Google DataStudio
Bachelor of Computer Science, a similar technical degree, or have equivalent experience
Proficiency in SQL and Python (or a similar language for data processing) with exposure to other scripting or object-oriented programming languages
Strong experience in data modelling and quantitative analysis, plus data analysis concepts like data visualization, dashboard design and data mining


Who you are and your life at REW.


You are passionate about personal and professional growth, always seeking new knowledge and innovative technologies

You can maintain a balance between independent work and teamwork, contributing positively to team dynamics and company culture
Analysis is in your DNA, enabling you to craft insightful and maintainable dashboards that tell and compelling story of the data for all stakeholders
You communicate technical designs and concepts with clarity, ensuring alignment and understanding across the team.
You are committed to continuous learning, staying up to date with the company’s products and features to drive and improve performance analytics
You are willing to work primarily in-office at our Vancouver location


What we can offer you.

In addition to competitive compensation, we provide a comprehensive benefits package, the best equipment for you to do your best work, and awesome perks and team events to keep you connected. Annual base salary for this role is $90,000 - $120,000 per year, dependant on experience.

Awesome. Something led you here, maybe a glimpse of potential and something amazing? Well that’s how we feel about Klue.

Who are we?

Klue is a VC backed, capital-efficient high growth SaaS company. Tiger Global and Salesforce Ventures led our US$62m Series B in the fall of 2021. We’re creating the category of competitive enablement: helping companies understand their market and outmaneuver their competition. We benefit from having an experienced leadership team working alongside several hundred risk-taking builders who elevate every day.

We’re one of Canada’s Most Admired Corporate Cultures by Waterstone HC, a Deloitte Technology Fast 50 & Fast 500 winner, and recipient of both the Startup of the Year and Tech Culture of the Year awards at the Technology Impact Awards.

The Data Insights' team scope covers data validation for existing sources, outsourced content, and new potential data sources. This role is focused on quality checks at scale and you will be key in ensuring that our data providers and outsourced content creators are delivering high-quality content that is linked back to source data. As the data marketplace is always evolving, you will also be involved in POC's of new data sources that can support manual curation initiatives.

This is You:


Highly analytical and critical thinker
Ability to digest and communicate complex data
You like ambiguity and thrive in fast-paced environments
Your Excel and/or Python skills are top notch
Strong communicator and natural networker
You like to learn new things and are keen to become an expert


Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

Chainlink Labs is the primary contributing developer of Chainlink, the decentralized computing platform powering the verifiable web. Chainlink is the industry-standard platform for providing access to real-world data, offchain computation, and secure cross-chain interoperability across any blockchain. Chainlink Labs helps power verifiable applications for banking, DeFi, global trade, and gaming by collaborating with some of the world’s largest financial institutions, notably Swift, DTCC, and ANZ. Chainlink Labs also works with top Web3 teams, including Aave, Compound, GMX, Maker, and Synthetix. Chainlink Labs was ranked in Newsweek’s 100 Most Loved Workplaces 2023 in both the United States and United Kingdom.

Chainlink Labs is pioneering the world’s first fully sustainable and decentralized oracle network, and the Economics team is searching for a Senior Analyst to play a critical role in building it. This role will sit at the intersection of blockchain technology, financial innovation, and economic systems, and shape the future of decentralized economics.

As a Senior Analyst, you will combine economics, data science, and blockchain expertise to shape incentives, optimize network design, and influence the decision-making of our Economics and Executive Leadership teams. You will design, analyze, and operationalize economic models for production applications. You will collaborate across departments to bring innovative solutions from concept to production, ensuring economic soundness and scalability throughout.

This is a high-impact role, offering visibility and influence as you contribute to the development of the Chainlink network. If you’re a meticulous, creative, and motivated individual ready to solve complex economic problems through data-driven decisions in the rapidly evolving world of Web3, this is the role for you.

Your Impact


You'll serve two primary functions: (1) designing and performing analyses that help the Economics and Executive Leadership teams make informed, data-driven decisions, and (2) building and maintaining systems for the parameterization of production applications.
You'll work on a wide array of blockchain economics projects, analyses, and systems, including:
Designing novel mechanisms and incentive schemes
Building models and simulations to evaluate investment opportunities
Designing and parameterizing trading systems
Optimizing parameters for production applications
Contributing to the design of Economics programs and applications
You'll optimize network incentives and systems by engaging directly with the Economics, Product, Engineering, Research, and Data Science teams to understand network dynamics at the deepest level.
You'll operationalize processes and analytics systems, and coordinate cross-functionally to implement them.
This is both a highly technical and highly social role. You will have high visibility and a large impact on how Chainlink builds the world’s first fully sustainable decentralized oracle network.

Requirements


5+ years experience in a quantitative role, particularly trading or quant research
A deep understanding of financial and crypto markets and incentives
Extensive financial modeling background, including data engineering and model automation
Strong SQL and Python skills are mandatory
Experience solving economic problems through statistical/econometric analyses
Substantial data analysis and/or data science experience
Meticulous attention to detail.


Preferred Qualifications


Strong Economics and/or Finance background through Masters-level academics and/or multiple years of industry experience.
Strong organizational and coordination skills necessary to productionize/operationalize processes and applications.
Preferably smart contract programming experience (Rust, Go, Solidity), but familiarity with smart contract code and dApp architecture at a minimum
Published research with an economics or crypto focus (e.g., papers on MEV or PBS, staking and slashing dynamics, node compensation, tokenomics, etc.)


All roles with Chainlink Labs are global and remote-based. Unless otherwise stated, we ask that you try to overlap some working hours with Eastern Standard Time (EST).
