This is a great opportunity for two Data Analysts to join our Measurement, Commercial and Treasury Credit Risk team. The team covers a span of accountabilities including governance for data in the Credit Risk data domain, Credit Risk and financial controls, regulatory and critical reporting, calculation of IFRS9 provision, and stress testing & forecasting for capital requirements.

This Data Analyst role will play a key part in the Data Governance Team for Retail and Commercial Credit Risk, with emphasis on developing data governance maturity for the area through the embedding of the Enterprise Data Governance Framework. You’ll play a key role in developing and maintaining data quality for Nationwide’s internal retail data, and data shared between Nationwide and external credit reference agencies.




This is a fantastic opportunity for someone who has an analytical mindset, is conscious of the importance of data accuracy and controls and is keen to develop their technical skills and Credit Risk knowledge.




We are happy to consider flexible working approaches to help you perform at your best.

At Nationwide we offer hybrid working wherever possible. More rewarding relationships are supported through our hybrid approach, bringing colleagues together across our UK wide estate, whilst also supporting generous access to home working. We value our time in the office to solve problems, to learn, and to feel connected.




For this job you'll spend at least two days per week, or if part time you'll spend 40% of your working time, based at either our Northampton or Swindon office. If your application is successful, your hiring manager will provide further details on how this works. You can also find out more about our approach to hybrid working here.

If we receive a high volume of relevant applications, we may close the advert earlier than the advertised date, so please apply as soon as you can.




What you’ll be doing:

Under the guidance of a Risk Manager, you’ll primarily be responsible for executing our processes to evaluate data quality and compiling the results into reports. As part of our processes for sharing the data with our stakeholders, you’ll be investigating any data issues found and raising them with the appropriate teams for resolution.

The job isn’t just producing the outputs though. When we get feedback, we need to adjust our processes to suit, so you’ll also be involved in designing and updating data quality rules using SAS Enterprise Guide, DI Studio and SAS Viya, with the potential to gain experience in some of the new data governance tools being introduced within the society.

A combination of on-the-job training, as well as more formal courses, will give you the knowledge and skills you need to be able to thrive in the role, and the varied nature of the wider team’s work will allow plenty of opportunities to get involved in other data governance subjects.




About you:

As a minimum requirement you’ll need to have/be:

Experience of coding and/or analytical tools such as SAS/SQL; SAS coding experience will be preferred but we would encourage anyone with an aptitude for coding to apply
Strong Microsoft Excel skills
Highly numerate and have experience of analysing and interpreting data
Able to support the production of high-quality outputs that provide clear insight
A passion for digging into issues and looking for a cause and resolution
Able to demonstrate a logical approach to performing a task, whilst paying attention to detail
Self-motivated, with an ability to work both independently and as part of a team




Our Customer First behaviours are all about putting customers and members at the heart of how we work together. You can strengthen your application by showing the behaviours that resonate with you, and how you might have already demonstrated these.

Say it straight - This is about being honest and direct with good intent and saying what needs to be said in the room. It’s also about being clear, precise, and using language that we and, importantly, our customers and members can understand.
Push for better - This is about aiming high and constantly looking for better in how we work together and serve our customers and members.
Get it done - This is about prioritising what will have the greatest impact, being decisive and taking accountability for delivering on the end-to-end outcome.




We know applying for jobs can sometimes feel like you’re sending an application into a black hole. We review each application individually. So, it’s a good idea to call out your most relevant experience on your application to give yourself the best chance.




The extras you’ll get:

There are all sorts of employee benefits available at Nationwide, including:

A personal pension – if you put in 7% of your salary, we’ll top up by a further 16%
Up to 2 days of paid volunteering a year
Life assurance worth 8x your salary
A great selection of additional benefits through our salary sacrifice scheme
Wellhub – Access to a range of free and paid options for health and wellness
Access to an annual performance related bonus
Access to training to help you develop and progress your career
25 days holiday, pro rata




What makes us different:

Nationwide is the world’s largest building society. With over 15 million customers, we have a relationship with almost a quarter of the UK’s population. We’ve got the scale to compete with the big banks, but we’re not a bank.

As a building society, we’re owned by our members – that’s our customers who have their current account, mortgage or savings with us. It means we can do things differently to deliver our Purpose – Banking – but fairer, more rewarding, and for the good of society.

When you work at Nationwide, you can experience that difference for yourself. You’ll be part of a high-performing, purpose-driven organisation that offers rewarding career experiences and a highly competitive range of benefits to match. You’ll also be joining us at an important time as we seek to reach more and more people in the UK. We want everyone in the UK to know that they don’t have to bank with a bank. They can choose a modern mutual instead.

You will complete daily operational planners and monitor the daily plan ensuring time critical stock release and movement. Reporting into a Workflow Assistant Site Manager, you will communicate any analysis and evaluation to them to enable operational managers to plan and make decisions based on current data.

This is what our people say:

“ It's been over 10 years since I joined Vanquis, and it has truly been an enriching experience. Currently, I am an Operations Analyst in the Customer Operations Strategy team. Before this, I spent eight years in the Fraud Department while balancing my job working part-time and looking after my children.

Transitioning to an analyst role over two years ago was a new and exciting challenge for me. Initially, the world of analysis and technical skills were unfamiliar, but within a few months, I was involved in various projects. This exposure was invaluable as a new starter. Throughout my career, I've held different positions, but I realized that the most satisfying aspect of each role was the analytical work. I love solving problems, digging into root causes, and developing creative solutions.

The Customer Operations Strategy team is fantastic, fostering a friendly, team-oriented environment that encourages a healthy work-life balance. Vanquis has provided numerous learning opportunities, including external courses like SAS certification and unlimited access to LinkedIn Learning. Additionally, they support my personal growth by offering paid time off to volunteer for charities and organizations of my choice.” - SM, Operations Analyst

“I started my career at Vanquis straight from sixth form in a telephony role in Customer Service, after 8 years and great dedication I have recently became a Strategy Assurance Lead Analyst. My journey has consisted of a number of roles, opening up opportunities within Process & Change and Remediation. This is a great company for building a career in analytics. There is a constant strive to learn and continuously improve, both personally and as a company, with the best support network and opportunities to progress.” – AC, Strategy Assurance Lead Analyst.

Your working life: If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.
