🌎 What we do

We build software that helps companies along the food system get to Net Zero.

~31% of global GHG emissions originate from food-related activities. For the first time in history, climate performance has become an overall business performance indicator. Enterprises are mandated by regulatory bodies to disclose their climate performance, which leads to increasing pressure from investors, competitors, retailers, and consumers to prevent and reduce their CO2e emissions. Over the next 10 years, companies have set ambitious reduction targets that need to be met. Enterprise software and new business processes can help.

We raised >€10m in funding in the first 2 years of our existence, we launched our enterprise product, signed and onboarded some of the largest F&B players in Europe, and put together what we believe is the best-suited early stage tech team in Europe. Will you be the next to join us? 🚀

🔭 What you will work on

Your mission

Help our users make sense of their data and pave the way to Net Zero Emissions.

Over the next 12 months you will:


Create Actionable Insights for Net Zero
Identify data patterns to help users understand and communicate their carbon footprints more effectively to customers and suppliers.
Turn emission data into clear, impactful analytics for users so they can make better decisions.
Bridge data to real-world measures - our users and farmers don’t live in spreadsheets.
Build Prototypes and Products
Develop models and prototypes to help clients set targets and model Net Zero scenarios.
Develop a strong understanding of our users and their unique challenges.
Work closely with the product team to transform prototypes into scalable SaaS products.
Upskill the Team with Data & AI
Stay up-to-date with the latest trends in data analytics and AI product building.
Empower self-service across teams.
Foster a data-first culture in a fast-growing environment where it’s easy to simply listen to your gut feeling.

🚀 You might be really good for this role if


You have a ""get-it-done"" attitude and the ability to learn really fast.
You have built products from scratch in the past, be it on your own or as part of a bigger undertaking inside your company.
You were part of the first 1-50 employees at an early stage technology company, no matter in what position.
You understand and care equally as much about the “why” behind the numbers, you think outcome-first.
You are highly reliable and can organise your work really well.


You don't feel like you fulfil all the criteria? We get it: confidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. But guess what?! There is no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. The only thing you need to ensure along the recruiting process and beyond is that the problem that we are solving with Root is one you cannot wait to get out of bed for on Monday morning! 🤗

Berlin, London, Remote

________________________

Hello 👋 I am Puneet, Co- founder and CPO at Kayzen, and I am now looking for a Lead Data Analyst who will be a part of the our Data Analytics ( Data ) team. 🙌

But wait, you have not heard of Kayzen before? 😃

Kayzen is a mobile demand-side platform (DSP) dedicated to democratizing programmatic advertising. We enable leading apps, agencies, media buyers, and brands to run programmatic customer acquisition, retargeting, and brand performance campaigns through its self-serve and managed service options.

Built on the three core pillars of performance, transparency, and control, Kayzen powers the world's best mobile marketing teams with bespoke solutions that fuel business growth and deliver a competitive advantage.

With an unprecedented scale of 160B+ daily ad requests from 1.6B+ unique users worldwide, we serve up to 1B+ ads per day in 180 countries. Kayzen is accessible through our APIs and user interface.

The role

As the Lead Data Analyst, you will ensure that the Data Analytics team consistently applies advanced descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive analytics to deliver high-value insights across multiple stakeholders. At Kayzen, our Data Analytics team operates within the broader ""Data Team,"" which also includes Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering. Collectively, the Data Team develops and deploys the machine learning models that power our clients' advertising performance in the programmatic ecosystem.

Within this structure, the Data Analytics team serves as a critical bridge between the Data Team and the broader business units (e.g., campaign managers, business owners, product managers).

Through your leadership, you will champion a data-driven culture and empower teams across Kayzen to harness analytical insights in a consistent and impactful way.

Responsibilities

As a hands-on leader, you will combine technical prowess with strategic vision—driving complex analysis, mentoring team members, and tackling data challenges directly. You will address a variety of problems, such as feature engineering, A/B testing, fraud detection, bidding decisions to name a few examples. Your key responsibilities include:


Team Leadership & Mentorship: Guide and develop the Data Analytics team, ensuring the quality and impact of their deliverables.
Roadmap Definition: Shape both the Data Analytics roadmap and the broader Data Team roadmap, making decisions that align with business priorities and objectives.
Data-Driven Model Research: Provide in-depth research to inform machine learning model development, leveraging both internal and external data sources to generate actionable insights.
Analytical & Statistical Expertise: Serve as the primary source of rigorous analytics for various data problems, evaluating system performance , finding performance issues and devising solutions for them
Data Accessibility & Quality Control: Facilitate data access throughout the organization while maintaining a centralized oversight to guarantee data quality.


What this role is not about:


This is not a typical BI role, where you are just expected to receive requirements and build dashboards. At Kayzen, the Data Analyst role is more investigative and we need people capable to ask questions and to answer them.
This is not a campaign management role, where you will be responsible for operational campaign optimization.


Requirements


5+ years of experience in the Ad-Tech industry, working in Data Analytics or related fields;
SQL (advanced);
Python (intermediate);
Expertise in data mining, processing, modeling and data visualization and strong analytical skills;
A results-driven, hands-on mindset that combines rapid experimentation, pragmatic problem-solving, and a passion for delivering exceptional customer-focused solutions;
High level of proactiveness and eagerness to solve issues;
A strong sense of ownership and strong work ethics;
Experience with Big Data technologies (Spark, HDFS, Hive, etc) is a plus;
Experience with Git and Airflow is a plus.


What do we offer?


Reporting directly to Co-founder & CPO
Direct access to top management and an extremely ""visible"" role
Exceptional career growth and learning opportunity
A unique opportunity to be part of an experienced team of industry experts and entrepreneurs who bring massive change to the Adtech market
Direct, day-to-day work experience with the management
A fun, driven, and multinational team located across Germany, India, UK, Argentina, Ukraine, Turkey, Spain and many more countries
A flexible work-from-home arrangement
A 500-dollar home-office setup budget
A 1000-dollar annual learning and development budget

________________________

Hello 👋 I am Puneet, Co- founder and CPO at Kayzen, and I am now looking for a Lead Data Analyst who will be a part of the our Data Analytics ( Data ) team. 🙌

But wait, you have not heard of Kayzen before? 😃

Kayzen is a mobile demand-side platform (DSP) dedicated to democratizing programmatic advertising. We enable leading apps, agencies, media buyers, and brands to run programmatic customer acquisition, retargeting, and brand performance campaigns through its self-serve and managed service options.

Built on the three core pillars of performance, transparency, and control, Kayzen powers the world's best mobile marketing teams with bespoke solutions that fuel business growth and deliver a competitive advantage.

With an unprecedented scale of 160B+ daily ad requests from 1.6B+ unique users worldwide, we serve up to 1B+ ads per day in 180 countries. Kayzen is accessible through our APIs and user interface.

The role

As the Lead Data Analyst, you will ensure that the Data Analytics team consistently applies advanced descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive analytics to deliver high-value insights across multiple stakeholders. At Kayzen, our Data Analytics team operates within the broader ""Data Team,"" which also includes Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering. Collectively, the Data Team develops and deploys the machine learning models that power our clients' advertising performance in the programmatic ecosystem.

Within this structure, the Data Analytics team serves as a critical bridge between the Data Team and the broader business units (e.g., campaign managers, business owners, product managers).

Through your leadership, you will champion a data-driven culture and empower teams across Kayzen to harness analytical insights in a consistent and impactful way.

Responsibilities

As a hands-on leader, you will combine technical prowess with strategic vision—driving complex analysis, mentoring team members, and tackling data challenges directly. You will address a variety of problems, such as feature engineering, A/B testing, fraud detection, bidding decisions to name a few examples. Your key responsibilities include:


Team Leadership & Mentorship: Guide and develop the Data Analytics team, ensuring the quality and impact of their deliverables.
Roadmap Definition: Shape both the Data Analytics roadmap and the broader Data Team roadmap, making decisions that align with business priorities and objectives.
Data-Driven Model Research: Provide in-depth research to inform machine learning model development, leveraging both internal and external data sources to generate actionable insights.
Analytical & Statistical Expertise: Serve as the primary source of rigorous analytics for various data problems, evaluating system performance , finding performance issues and devising solutions for them
Data Accessibility & Quality Control: Facilitate data access throughout the organization while maintaining a centralized oversight to guarantee data quality.


What this role is not about:


This is not a typical BI role, where you are just expected to receive requirements and build dashboards. At Kayzen, the Data Analyst role is more investigative and we need people capable to ask questions and to answer them.
This is not a campaign management role, where you will be responsible for operational campaign optimization.


Requirements


5+ years of experience in the Ad-Tech industry, working in Data Analytics or related fields;
SQL (advanced);
Python (intermediate);
Expertise in data mining, processing, modeling and data visualization and strong analytical skills;
A results-driven, hands-on mindset that combines rapid experimentation, pragmatic problem-solving, and a passion for delivering exceptional customer-focused solutions;
High level of proactiveness and eagerness to solve issues;
A strong sense of ownership and strong work ethics;
Experience with Big Data technologies (Spark, HDFS, Hive, etc) is a plus;
Experience with Git and Airflow is a plus.


What do we offer?


Reporting directly to Co-founder & CPO
Direct access to top management and an extremely ""visible"" role
Exceptional career growth and learning opportunity
A unique opportunity to be part of an experienced team of industry experts and entrepreneurs who bring massive change to the Adtech market
Direct, day-to-day work experience with the management
A fun, driven, and multinational team located across Germany, India, UK, Argentina, Ukraine, Turkey, Spain and many more countries
A flexible work-from-home arrangement
A 500-dollar home-office setup budget
A 1000-dollar annual learning and development budget

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for fresh graduates who meet the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Enrolled in a quantitative Master’s program (e.g. Business Intelligence Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2024 or spring/summer 2025
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights



Preferred Qualifications


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects
Ability to learn new systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, San Francisco Bay Area, or New York City. We are hiring these positions in Chicago, IL or Toronto, Ontario, Canada.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for fresh graduates who meet the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Enrolled in a quantitative Master’s program (e.g. Business Intelligence Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2024 or spring/summer 2025
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights



Preferred Qualifications


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects
Ability to learn new systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, San Francisco Bay Area, or New York City. We are hiring these positions in Chicago, IL or Toronto, Ontario, Canada.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We believe that real estate is one of life’s great adventures. And, as we’ve helped Canadians navigate these uncharted waters, we’ve become the best real estate search platform in the country, and the leading marketplace in BC with an audience twice the size of our nearest rival.

We’ve done this by carefully assembling a team of great people who have great ideas. One of those genius-level ideas is to make REW quite simply the best place in the world to work - and we’d like your help to get there. Yup, really.

And that’s where you come in.

We’re searching for a hugely-motivated Data Analyst to help our Data Engineering Team better understand how our customers use our products, and - more importantly - to translate that understanding into insights that can transform our business.

A love of working with amazing people will be viewed as a plus, too.

Rocking the role.

Data is at the heart of everything we do at REW. Every day, our platform ingests feeds from dozens of sources to compile, composite and augment the listings that thousands of homeseekers search through in their quest for the perfect home.

But listings are only part of the puzzle. We also track market behaviour to help inform our own next steps and to empower the agents, landlords, and property developers who count on REW to give them an edge. And while we are awash in all this data, we sometimes risk losing sight of what works and what doesn’t.

That’s where we’d love your help, fellow adventurer.

You’d be joining a small team who are already evolving REW’s data platform, and act as a vital link between our platform and business stakeholders.

With a Great Role comes Great Responsibilities.

Data processing and modeling to derive business insights using a variety of quantitative analytical techniques
Collaborate with product development teams to provide insight to power new features and monitor their performance
Develop reports or data visualization tools for internal use to help support the REW's sales and marketing efforts
Participate in project planning and analysis as needed


Who you are is far more important than where you’ve been.

Proficiency in SQL and Python (or a similar language for data processing) with exposure to other scripting or object-oriented programming languages
Strong experience in data modelling and quantitative analysis, plus data analysis concepts like data visualization, dashboard design and data mining


Who you are and your life at REW.


You are passionate about personal and professional growth, always seeking new knowledge and innovative technologies
You thrive on sharing insights and knowledge with peers to foster a culture of learning and continuous improvement
You can maintain a balance between independent work and teamwork, contributing positively to team dynamics and company culture
Analysis is in your DNA, enabling you to craft insightful and maintainable dashboards that tell and compelling story of the data for all stakeholders
You communicate technical designs and concepts with clarity, ensuring alignment and understanding across the team.
You are committed to continuous learning, staying up to date with the company’s products and features to drive and improve performance analytics
You are willing to work primarily in-office at our Vancouver location


What we can offer you.

In addition to competitive compensation, we provide a comprehensive benefits package, the best equipment for you to do your best work, and awesome perks and team events to keep you connected. Annual base salary for this role is $90,000 - $120,000 per year, dependant on experience.

Awesome. Something led you here, maybe a glimpse of potential and something amazing? Well that’s how we feel about Klue.

Who are we?

Klue is a VC backed, capital-efficient high growth SaaS company. Tiger Global and Salesforce Ventures led our US$62m Series B in the fall of 2021. We’re creating the category of competitive enablement: helping companies understand their market and outmaneuver their competition. We benefit from having an experienced leadership team working alongside several hundred risk-taking builders who elevate every day.

We’re one of Canada’s Most Admired Corporate Cultures by Waterstone HC, a Deloitte Technology Fast 50 & Fast 500 winner, and recipient of both the Startup of the Year and Tech Culture of the Year awards at the Technology Impact Awards.

The Data Insights' team scope covers data validation for existing sources, outsourced content, and new potential data sources. This role is focused on quality checks at scale and you will be key in ensuring that our data providers and outsourced content creators are delivering high-quality content that is linked back to source data. As the data marketplace is always evolving, you will also be involved in POC's of new data sources that can support manual curation initiatives.

This is You:


Highly analytical and critical thinker
Ability to digest and communicate complex data
You like ambiguity and thrive in fast-paced environments
Your Excel and/or Python skills are top notch
Strong communicator and natural networker
You like to learn new things and are keen to become an expert


Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

Chainlink Labs is pioneering the world’s first fully sustainable and decentralized oracle network, and the Economics team is searching for a Senior Analyst to play a critical role in building it. This role will sit at the intersection of blockchain technology, financial innovation, and economic systems, and shape the future of decentralized economics.

As a Senior Analyst, you will combine economics, data science, and blockchain expertise to shape incentives, optimize network design, and influence the decision-making of our Economics and Executive Leadership teams.

This is a high-impact role, offering visibility and influence as you contribute to the development of the Chainlink network. If you’re a meticulous, creative, and motivated individual ready to solve complex economic problems through data-driven decisions in the rapidly evolving world of Web3, this is the role for you.

Your Impact

Designing novel mechanisms and incentive schemes
Building models and simulations to evaluate investment opportunities
Designing and parameterizing trading systems
Optimizing parameters for production applications
Contributing to the design of Economics programs and applications
You'll optimize network incentives and systems by engaging directly with the Economics, Product, Engineering, Research, and Data Science teams to understand network dynamics at the deepest level.
You'll operationalize processes and analytics systems, and coordinate cross-functionally to implement them.
This is both a highly technical and highly social role. You will have high visibility and a large impact on how Chainlink builds the world’s first fully sustainable decentralized oracle network.

Requirements

A deep understanding of financial and crypto markets and incentives
Extensive financial modeling background, including data engineering and model automation
Strong SQL and Python skills are mandatory
