What you SHOULD KNOW about VaynerMedia

Think ""lab"" and not ""agency"". We get excited about solving business problems, not creating advertising for the sake of making advertising. Our entrepreneurship DNA runs deep. We're willing to break rules, try new things, and test hypotheses if it means better understanding our craft. It's fun!

We believe 100% that brands can be built on digital platforms and part of our model is built bottom up, flipping the traditional advertising model and process on its head. We don't play to agency/industry norms and our culture and energy reflects that.

Our environment (and pace) feels much more like a start-up than most agencies you might be used to. Hopefully that, and the opportunity to collaborate with the talented and enthusiastic crew, work with big brands excites you, as it does us. We can't wait to meet you.

VaynerMedia is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

Build the future of Health. Create your life’s best work.

If healthcare were built for today, it wouldn’t resemble the reactive, fragmented system we see now. It would be proactive, personalized, and preventative - designed to optimize wellbeing and unlock human potential.

Through curating world-class products and our revolutionary Healf Zone platform, we’re creating a science-driven, personalized approach to preventative care that inspires better living every day. Backed by visionary investors - including those who backed Alo Yoga, Cult Beauty, Innocent Smoothies and Soho House - we’re redefining what health looks like for the world.This isn’t just a business; it’s a movement - a generational opportunity to reshape how we live.

Join us

Analyse trends, optimise insights, and build models that power decisions in a fast-scaling eCommerce startup. Join A+ players and do your life’s best work. 🚀

Build the future of Health. Create your life’s best work.

If healthcare were built for today, it wouldn’t resemble the reactive, fragmented system we see now.

As a Junior Sport Client Analyst, you’ll make decisions on client statuses – assessing their long-term performance potential – review processes, recommend improvements and amend/introduce new reports.




With the aim of delivering the best client experience, you’ll also work closely with the company’s sport traders!




Gambling reporting, reviewing new clients, and planning for future reviews will also be a part of your day-to-day, so an interest in sport and sport betting is key.




Dealing with numbers, you’ll need a strong quantitative background, and a knowledge of statistical programming software and techniques is a bonus (SQL, Python, R, C#, VBA etc…)!




Joining as a Junior Client Analyst, you can expect a lot of help from more experienced client analysts who can mentor you and give you pointers wherever you need them.




If you’re reading this and wondering if you’re right, it’s most likely you’re a recent graduate with a quantitative degree and you’re looking for your first job.




So, if you have an interest in sport, maths and client service, this could be the job for you.




The starting salary will be up to £38,000 plus bonuses based on performance. Other benefits include a contributory pension scheme, private medical insurance, various discounts and plenty of social events.




No updated CV required.

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.

Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We believe that real estate is one of life’s great adventures. And, as we’ve helped Canadians navigate these uncharted waters, we’ve become the best real estate search platform in the country, and the leading marketplace in BC with an audience twice the size of our nearest rival.

We’ve done this by carefully assembling a team of great people who have great ideas. One of those genius-level ideas is to make REW quite simply the best place in the world to work - and we’d like your help to get there. Yup, really.

And that’s where you come in.

We’re searching for a hugely-motivated Data Analyst to help our Data Engineering Team better understand how our customers use our products, and - more importantly - to translate that understanding into insights that can transform our business.

A love of working with amazing people will be viewed as a plus, too.

Rocking the role.

Data is at the heart of everything we do at REW. Every day, our platform ingests feeds from dozens of sources to compile, composite and augment the listings that thousands of homeseekers search through in their quest for the perfect home.

But listings are only part of the puzzle. We also track market behaviour to help inform our own next steps and to empower the agents, landlords, and property developers who count on REW to give them an edge. And while we are awash in all this data, we sometimes risk losing sight of what works and what doesn’t.

That’s where we’d love your help, fellow adventurer.

You’d be joining a small team who are already evolving REW’s data platform, and act as a vital link between our platform and business stakeholders.

With a Great Role comes Great Responsibilities.

We believe that real estate is one of life’s great adventures. And, as we’ve helped Canadians navigate these uncharted waters, we’ve become the best real estate search platform in the country, and the leading marketplace in BC with an audience twice the size of our nearest rival.

We’ve done this by carefully assembling a team of great people who have great ideas. One of those genius-level ideas is to make REW quite simply the best place in the world to work - and we’d like your help to get there. Yup, really.

And that’s where you come in.

We’re searching for a hugely-motivated Data Analyst to help our Data Engineering Team better understand how our customers use our products, and - more importantly - to translate that understanding into insights that can transform our business.

A love of working with amazing people will be viewed as a plus, too.

Rocking the role.

Data is at the heart of everything we do at REW. Every day, our platform ingests feeds from dozens of sources to compile, composite and augment the listings that thousands of homeseekers search through in their quest for the perfect home.

But listings are only part of the puzzle. We also track market behaviour to help inform our own next steps and to empower the agents, landlords, and property developers who count on REW to give them an edge. And while we are awash in all this data, we sometimes risk losing sight of what works and what doesn’t.

That’s where we’d love your help, fellow adventurer.

You’d be joining a small team who are already evolving REW’s data platform, and act as a vital link between our platform and business stakeholders.

With a Great Role comes Great Responsibilities.

Collaborate with product development teams to provide insight to power new features and monitor their performance
Develop reports or data visualization tools for internal use to help support the REW's sales and marketing efforts
Participate in project planning and analysis as needed


Who you are is far more important than where you’ve been.

At least one year of professional experience with Tableau or other data visualization tools such as PowerBI, and/or Google DataStudio

Strong experience in data modelling and quantitative analysis, plus data analysis concepts like data visualization, dashboard design and data mining


Who you are and your life at REW.


You are passionate about personal and professional growth, always seeking new knowledge and innovative technologies
You thrive on sharing insights and knowledge with peers to foster a culture of learning and continuous improvement
You can maintain a balance between independent work and teamwork, contributing positively to team dynamics and company culture
Analysis is in your DNA, enabling you to craft insightful and maintainable dashboards that tell and compelling story of the data for all stakeholders
You communicate technical designs and concepts with clarity, ensuring alignment and understanding across the team.
You are committed to continuous learning, staying up to date with the company’s products and features to drive and improve performance analytics
You are willing to work primarily in-office at our Vancouver location
