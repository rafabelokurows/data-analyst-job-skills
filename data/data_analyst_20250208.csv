Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have an absolute love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem, and living inside a spreadsheet/data set to find the answer to any question.
Because you love data, you have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis. Experience with Marketing APIs, Big Query or other Cloud Data Warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.), ETL Tools (Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics) and/or Python are all pluses.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and have spent a minimum of 1 year working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.




What You’ll Do:

Reporting: With your expertise in Advanced Excel, SQL, Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools, you’ll be maintaining customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence, generating pivot tables and other visualizations that summarize thousands of lines of data. You should have experience in translating performance media metrics into coherent, digestible reports for client ad campaigns and be comfortable communicating via Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.
Strategy: You’ll be responsible for learning our clients’ businesses and aligning their media strategy with business goals as well as understanding advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to help guide media buying strategy. With a background in paid media and/or digital advertising, you understand concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue and are able to be engaged in discussions with clients to gain trust and shareholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.




Gupta Media is an office-first (with flexibility) organization and we are excited to have our team working together again

Business Intelligence:

Develop new dashboards in Looker Studio from scratch while maintaining stylistic consistency across all reporting for ease of use and easy incorporation into external reports.
Make recommendations on how to better visualize data and update existing Looker Studio dashboards to reflect changing business needs.
Provide recommendations on potential business gaps that need additional data infrastructure to inform the organization of relevant business trends, such as: performance of social media channels, speed of product fulfillment, and common customer feedback in product reviews.




Cross Functional:

Excellent ability to communicate complex data concepts and insights across all levels of the organization via written and verbal communication.
Leverage a strong understanding of the business to inform what projects should be prioritized and will make the greatest impact on the business.
Proactively manage stakeholder expectations to keep leaders informed and up to date on ad-hoc requests, in-progress deliverables, and impactful changes to the data infrastructure.




What You Need to Succeed:

1-2 years experience working with SQL/BigQuery at an advanced level required.
0-2 years experience in an analytics or data engineering role.
Advanced understanding of data visualization tools (Tableau, Looker, Google Data Studio, etc.).
High business acumen with ability to understand day-to-day operations across various job functions.
Strong Excel skills with experience manipulating, analyzing and visualizing data.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills.

At CarGurus (NASDAQ: CARG), our mission is to give people the power to reach their destination. We started as a small team of developers determined to bring trust and transparency to car shopping. Since then, our history of innovation and go-to-market acceleration has driven industry-leading growth. In fact, we’re the largest and fastest-growing automotive marketplace, and we’ve been profitable for over 15 years.

What We Do

The market is evolving, and we are too, moving the entire automotive journey online and guiding our customers through every step. That includes everything from the sale of an old car to the financing, purchase, and delivery of a new one. Today, tens of millions of consumers visit CarGurus.com each month, and ~30,000 dealerships use our products. But they're not the only ones who love CarGurus—our employees do, too. We have a people-first culture that fosters kindness, collaboration, and innovation, and empowers our Gurus with tools to fuel their career growth. Disrupting a trillion-dollar industry requires fresh and diverse perspectives. Come join us for the ride!

Role Overview

We are looking for a Product Data Analyst to join our Consumer team which tackles a complex data environment, building out data assets, running experiments, and many more unstructured analytics tasks to support the core listings business.

Our Product Data Analytics org as a whole supports our Product and Engineering teams, providing the final word on all analytics for CarGurus’ user and dealer experiences. We are looking for thoughtful, curious, internally driven candidates who can dive into complex data and draw novel, insightful conclusions.

What You’ll Do


Using your SQL expertise, conduct exploratory empirical analyses that bridge disparate data sources (e.g. website usage, subscription records, inventory volumes, etc.) to quantify product performance, user behavior, and/or market trends. Doing so will require distilling unstructured “big data” into actionable insights.
Creatively compress sweeping, high-level exploratory requests into specific calculations that address your stakeholders’ underlying needs.
Relentlessly dig into the data – consulting with other individuals and teams as you judge necessary – beyond the letter of the initial assignment, to hammer out any anomalies or self-direct your inquiry into other relevant issues.
Be comfortable escalating and automating your analyses using R/Python scripting.
Be the authority on A/B experimentation, advising engineers and product managers on everything from the necessary data points to collect, required sample sizes, optimal metrics to examine, robustness of numerical findings, and the bottom-line success or failure of the tested changes.
Provide technical guidance on and ideas for improving A/B testing-related tools, algorithms, and automated processes.
Conduct self-directed research on the latest trends in A/B experimentation, and map out internal improvements based on your findings.
Advocate for specific, data-driven product innovations that help further high-level company strategy, primarily in partnership with the Product/Engineering teams.
Participate in brainstorming and planning discussions across the organization to these ends.
Avoid passivity in the face of flawed proposals; tactfully and persuasively push back against potential missteps.
Craft the metrics that define business success, condensing abstract or loosely-defined concepts down to concrete calculations.
Audit and improve existing metrics to better inform the business’ needs.
Build intuitive dashboards and other visual monitoring tools to guide daily decision-making by senior stakeholders and the company at large.
Experiment with new kinds of visualizations that you believe could be better utilized in the organization.
Re-work underlying code to appropriately structure visualization inputs.
Communicate and present complex quantitative findings in easily digestible terms to company leadership, homing in on key takeaways.
Concretely and informatively respond to any probing, on-the-spot follow-up questions from senior decision-makers.
Conceive of new data assets and build automated transformations (via DBT, LookML, etc.) to bring them to fruition.
Partner with Data Engineering teams to advance core data modeling/architecture (e.g. user clickstream logging), by optimizing, integrating, and distilling large raw datasets and metadata.
Draw upon prior experience with expansive, unrefined datasets to fix modeling bottlenecks in quick, scalable, outside-of-the-box ways.


What You’ll Bring


2+ years of experience in an analytics or analytics-adjacent field, ideally involving complex data modeling, quantitative analysis, and applied statistics.
Expert fluency in SQL. Experience with statistical programming (R, Stata, SAS, Python) is desirable.
Working understanding of core statistical concepts (regression, significance testing, omitted variable bias, independence/dependence, etc.).
Knack for creative data visualizations.
Willingness to step outside your role and independently come up with novel ideas for the business.
Willingness to challenge others’ ideas and advocate for your own.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Very comfortable presenting high-impact and potentially sensitive findings to senior leadership.
Strong project planning skills, with experience building roadmaps, estimating required resources, and flagging inter-dependencies with other teams/projects.
Preferred tools/programs: Snowflake, Snowplow, DBT, Looker, Jira, Salesforce, Google/MS suite

Almost 600,000 tech employees have been laid off since 2022 and it's still ongoing. The effect of this has led hundreds of thousands of laid off Tech employees competing with existing Jobseekers.

Entry level Job seekers struggle to get responses to their applications, are getting ghosted after interviews. In such a scenario the Job seekers need to differentiate themselves by ensuring to obtain exceptional skills and technologies so that they can wear multiple roles at a client as clients now would want to expand roles and responsibilities assigned to a particular job to save costs.

.We at Synergisticit understand the problem of the mismatch between employer's requirements and Employee skills and that's why since 2010 we have helped 1000's of candidates get jobs at technology clients like apple, google, Paypal, western union, Client, visa, walmart labs etc to name a few

Bain Capital Overview

With approximately $185 billion of assets under management, Bain Capital is one of the world’s leading private investment firms. We create lasting impact for our investors, teams, businesses, and the communities in which we live. Over four decades we have strategically grown our platform to focus on Private Equity, Growth & Venture, Capital Solutions, Credit & Capital Markets, and Real Assets. Today, our team includes 1,880+ employees in 24 offices on four continents.

We partner differently to help people and companies embrace possibility and realize potential. Founded as a private partnership in 1984, we have fostered a culture of innovation, entrepreneurialism, and agility, empowering our people to define and own their career trajectories. Today, our partnership approach enables us to pursue strategic growth, build enduring relationships with a robust external network, and collaborate across our integrated platform to connect the deep and diverse expertise that unlocks breakthrough insights.

Our people are the heart of our advantage. Colleagues at all levels have a seat at the table as they tackle business challenges with a principal investor mindset. By asking incisive questions, respectfully challenging one another, and remaining intellectually agile, we work together to achieve exceptional outcomes.

Bain Capital Partnership Strategies:

Bain Capital Partnership Strategies was formed in 2005, initially to find investments for the personal capital of Bain Capital’s partners. Our Boston-based team combines rigorous fundamental research, deep experience across asset classes, and a global perspective to make unique investments that are not widely available. Partnership Strategies began accepting external capital in 2018 and currently manages ~$2.5 billion of assets on behalf of a diverse set of LPs.

The Partnership Strategies Fund (PSF) is a multi-strategy hedge fund with a differentiated investment approach. The Fund utilizes off-market sourcing, detailed underwriting, and a long-term time horizon to create a diversified portfolio of hard-to-access investments that generate returns uncorrelated to equity markets.

Position Description:

The Partnership Strategies’ data and engineering team, which currently consists of a Data Analyst, BI Developer, Data Architect, and Development Director, is growing, and we are looking for a motivated, independent, and well-rounded data analyst with strong problem-solving skills to join this high performing team. This position will support a range of investment strategies that rely on our ability to rapidly source and analyze complex datasets. This role provides a unique opportunity to design and build foundational tools in an early-stage, rapidly growing data environment.

Responsibilities include technical design, development, support, and maintenance of strategic technology assets that are critical to the business’ success. Core to the position will be utilizing Cloud services to build scalable and efficient data pipelines and storage solutions, as well as the ability to analyze, interpret, and present complex data sets, both structured and unstructured, in a manner that is consumable by the investment teams to support business decision-making.

This position is an opportunity to work closely with, and learn from, seasoned investors that have decades of experience investing globally. Projects are run in small pods with cross functional expertise and collaboration of portfolio manager(s), research analysts, and engineers/developers. This is a dynamic and fast-moving team that has a flexible mandate to invest in a broad variety of markets including commodities, public equities, fixed income, environmental markets, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies. Given this broad scope, the data analyst must demonstrate independent problem-solving skills, the ability to tackle complex challenges, and the flexibility to adapt quickly to shifting priorities and projects.

Technology Experience:


Proficiency in Python, SQL, and dbt, with demonstrated ability to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code
Experience with Airflow and Docker is a plus
Experience with cloud platforms is required (preferably AWS)
Hands-on experience with reporting, self-service dashboard technologies, and data visualization tools such as Streamlit, Plotly, Power BI, or Tableau
Experience with relational databases (preferably PostgreSQL)
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines and transformations
Knowledge of software development lifecycle
Experience with and understanding of source control (Git) and CI/CD processes
Proficient with current web scraping technologies
Familiarity with Kimball / Star schema data warehousing design is a plus
Familiarity with web and/or front-end development technologies (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.JS) is a plus
Experience with GitHub Copilot or other AI development productivity tool(s) preferred


Qualifications:


BS or MS degree in Computer Science or equivalent technical training and professional work experience
2-5 years of professional experience developing software applications
Must possess excellent verbal and written communication skills; ability to articulate technology concepts to non-technical stakeholders and ability to translate business needs and desired goals into technical requirements
Prior professional experience in the Financial Services industry or demonstrated interest in Finance, Economics, and/or Accounting is preferred, but not required
Strong analytical and technical problem-solving skills with an attention to detail
An interest in emerging technologies and a proven record of ability to pick up new platforms, techniques, and programming languages
Takes ownership and pride in end-to-end delivery of projects and initiatives eager to continue learning and excited to tackle complex problems
