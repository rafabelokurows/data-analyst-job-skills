At Warner Music Group, we’re a global collective of music makers and music lovers, tech innovators and inspired entrepreneurs, game-changing creatives and passionate team members. Here, we turn dreams into stardom and audiences into fans. We are guided by three core values that underpin everything we do across all our diverse businesses:


Curiosity: We do our best work when we’re immersing ourselves in culture and breaking through barriers. Curiosity is the driving force behind creativity and ingenuity. It fuels innovation, and innovation is the key to our future.
Collaboration: Making music and bringing it to the world is all about the power of originality amplified by teamwork. A great idea, like a great song, travels globally. We ignite passions and build connections across our diverse community of artists, songwriters, partners, and fans.
Commitment: We pursue excellence for our team and our talent. Everything in music starts with a leap into the unknown, and we’re committed to keeping the faith, acting with integrity, and delivering on our promises.


We remain committed to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We know it fosters a culture where you can truly belong, contribute, and grow. We encourage applications from people of any age, gender identity, sex or sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion or belief, disability, and any other protected characteristic or identity.

Consider a career at WMG and get the best of both worlds – an innovative global music company that retains the creative spirit of a nimble independent.

Job Title: Junior Data Analyst, 12 Month Contract

A Little Bit About Our Team

Our team of 4 handles the processing and invoicing of Warner’s worldwide digital sales, as well as reporting these sales to our affiliates worldwide for onward royalty accounting to our artists. We work very closely with a number of other departments, namely IT, Royalties, Business Development, Business Affairs and Finance.

Why This Could Be Your Next Big Break

You’ll be responsible for loading the streaming & download sales we’ve received from our digital providers, like Spotify, iTunes/Apple Music, Tidal and Deezer – to eventually get paid through to our Artists. You’ll also be clearing through any errored transactions that have ended up in suspense, making sure our Artists receive all of the revenue for sales they’ve made. You’ll be working at your own pace and have the freedom to complete tasks in the way that works for you, and have plenty of support from the rest of the team.

Here You’ll Get To


Work with large sets of data, and develop skills to analyse and transform data sets of varying sizes, from small to huge.
Learn about databases, data structures, and digital sales transactions of our repertoire – and how we go from the sale of an album, single or stream through to getting the royalty paid to the artist, and how the pricing of each stream/download is calculated.
Talk with our labels and our worldwide affiliates to resolve any queries that may pop up, or with our digital streaming / download platforms.


About You


You have a high level of proficiency with Microsoft Excel, familiar with its built-in functions.
You have a self-driven attitude to work, able to set your own deadlines, work independently, and communicate professionally with any of our external customers.
You have an analytical mindset, with the ability to see the “bigger picture” within large sets of data.
You have strong attention to detail and are extremely thorough.
You have good, proven education credentials with subjects such as Maths, IT, Economics or English, and are able to understand basic economic concepts such as foreign exchange rates.
You have an open approach to work, and the ability to adapt to a rapidly changing, developing and moving environment.


It would be music to our ears if you also had:


Experience working with databases and large sets of data.
Familiarity with scripting languages such as Python, particularly the Pandas library.
A self-motivated candidate with good communication skills who can problem solve and find solutions.


About Us

As the home to Asylum, Atlantic, East West, Elektra, FFRR, Fueled by Ramen, Nonesuch, Parlophone, Rhino, Roadrunner, Sire, Warner Records, Warner Classics, and several other of the world’s premier recording labels, Warner Music Group champions emerging artists and global superstars alike. And our renowned publishing company, Warner Chappell Music, represents genre-spanning songwriters and producers through a catalogue of more than one million copyrights worldwide. Warner Music Group is also home to ADA, which supports the independent community, as well as artist services division WMX. In addition, WMG counts film and television storytelling powerhouse Warner Music Entertainment among its many brands.

Together, we are Warner Music Group: Independent Minds. Major Sound.

Your title will be Data Analyst
This role pays £50k-£80k/year + equity
Matt, Cofounder and CTO, is the hiring manager
We work Mon-Thu in our office in Chancery Lane, London


What are we building? An AI Executive Assistant

In 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that we'd only be working 15 hours a week by 2030. Despite automation in agriculture and industry, that hasn't happened.

Why? The service sector. Walk around the average office and you'll see people's days taken up by emails, Slack and meetings instead of real work.

People in client facing roles - sales, professional services firms, recruiters - feel this most acutely. Instead of advising clients, they spend hours on admin. Following up. Scheduling meetings and taking notes on them. Answering repetitive questions over email.

We've built an AI executive assistant that looks at your emails, messages and meetings, and uses that knowledge to answer your email, schedule meetings, take next steps from meetings and organise your inbox.

Unlike other startups, we're a pure-play applied AI company, not a SaaS company with AI features hastily bolted on! We make use of the best techniques (fine tuned open source models, tool use, and retrieval augmented generation) and as a result, users send 53% of the email drafts we generate.

How has it been going?

Since launching in March 2024, we've gone from $0 to $2.5m in revenue across 3000 paid users. We did this with a team of 4, and without using any paid marketing until November.

We spent Q4 2024 in San Francisco at HF0, the best AI startup accelerator in the world, learning from experts like the CEO of Instacart, Head of Applied Research at OpenAI and the cofounder of Snowflake.

What do we value?

We're very intentional about adding new people. We think a small team of exceptional people working hard at a problem they care about will always beat a larger, more unfocused team. That means you'll need to bring an intensity to this role that might not be asked at other companies. But it also means you will be fast tracked into more senior roles and responsibilities far earlier.

We also believe in hiring people who want ownership and autonomy in their work, and giving it to them. Instead of just being handed tickets, you'll be proactively suggesting metrics that should be monitored and one off analyses that should be done, and proposing improvements to our analytics infrastructure.

What will I do?


Running analyses in SQL to make decisions on product, marketing spend, and pricing strategy, and communicating your findings, method, and recommendations in a clear way to both technical and non-technical audiences
Working with stakeholders in the marketing, sales, customer success and product departments to agree metrics that need to be monitored on an ongoing basis, then building visualisations
Working with data engineers to ensure data is modelled in the correct format to support data visualisation and more detailed analyses


What does our ideal hire look like?

You've worked at an early stage tech company (<100 people) as a data analyst or similar
You have an expert level understanding of both SQL and a data visualization tool (we use Metabase). If you don't know SQL to a very high standard, you shouldn't apply
You are excellent at communicating your analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences: the results, your recommendations, and the method you used
You can proactively structure an analysis given only a business problem
Urgency and intensity in your work


Our tech stack

Broadly, we use a fairly typical ELT stack. It's not a requirement to have worked with every tool we use, but the more the better!


BigQuery as our data warehouse
Metabase for data visualization
Fivetran to pipe raw data from third party tools (eg Stripe, which we use for billing) into our data warehouse
dbt hosted on Github Actions for transformation of raw data into production tables ready for consumption
Census for reverse ETL


The application process


Submit your CV (no need for a cover letter)
An initial call with someone from the Fyxer AI team to review your experience and motivation for joining (15 mins)
Live coding exercise - SQL (30 minutes)
Analytical case study (45 minutes)
Meet Richard - CEO (30 minutes)

Howden is a collective - a group of talented and passionate people all around the world. Together, we have pushed the boundaries of insurance. We are united by a shared passion and no-limits mind-set, and our strength lies in our ability to collaborate as a powerful international team comprised of 18,000 employees spanning over 100 countries.

People join Howden for many different reasons, but they stay for the same one: our culture. It's what sets us apart, and the reason our employees have been turning down disappointed head-hunters for years. Whatever your priorities - work/life balance, career progression, sustainability, volunteering - you'll find like-minded people driving change at Howden.

Working at Howden Re

At Howden Re, we're on a mission to do things differently. Our no silo approach, elite team, and clear focus on innovation and relentless execution means our clients are at the heart of all we do.

As a big 4 global reinsurance broker, we deliberately avoid the one-size-fits-all approach, committing to creating bespoke solutions that address the unique challenges of a modern and dynamic marketplace. Our team is empowered to drive progress, creating opportunities for career and personal development, unlocking new value for clients, fostering long-term partnerships, and using the collective power of Howden to change how the world sees risk and insurance.

When you join Howden Re, you become part of a vibrant and entrepreneurial workplace culture that prioritises collaboration, ownership, and shared success. Here, your contributions will directly impact our mission to be the global partner of choice in reinsurance and strategic advisory.

Be a part of Howden Re's exciting journey. Together, we are shaping the future of reinsurance.

Bowood is a longstanding Broking house in the Lloyd's marketplace encompassing members from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences. Within Bowood there are various pillars (teams) which foster and allow for a dynamic and collaborative approach; your voice and input will be heard and appreciated.

What will you be doing?

Working closely with Producing Brokers to assist them in the utilisation of Analytics to help develop and grow their existing books of business (some dating back to the mid-80's) and entice new business to this team. ​

The expectation being as you grow and learn into the job your experience will further refine and improve the reports you produce.

What skills are we looking for?

We are seeking an individual who has experience utilising Microsoft products and a willingness to learn how to use PowerBI and other analytical tools.





What do we offer in return?



A career that you define.

Our business succeeds by allowing our people to make a mark in the areas they care about most: personal development, volunteering, and fundraising for charity, or creating new insurance products that address society's greatest challenges.

And we know that separate home and work lives don't really exist. If you're happy and healthy at home, you're more likely to be happy and fulfilled at work - and vice versa. That's why we do our best to support our people in every aspect of their lives.



Diversity and Inclusion



At Howden we value diversity - there is no one Howden 'personality type'. Instead, we're looking for individuals who share the same values as us:

Our successes have all come from someone brave enough to try something new
We support each other, in the small everyday moments and the bigger challenges
We are determined to make a positive difference, at work and beyond

We consider our people our chief competitive advantage and as such we treat colleagues, candidates, clients, and business partners with equality, fairness, and respect - regardless of age, disability, race, religion or belief, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, or family circumstances.



Reasonable adjustments



We're committed to providing reasonable accommodations at Howden to ensure that our positions align well with your needs. Besides the usual adjustments such as software, IT, and office setups, we can also accommodate other changes such as flexible hours* or hybrid working*.

If you're excited by this role but have some doubts about whether it's the right fit for you, send us your application - if your profile fits the role's criteria, we will be in touch to assist in helping to get you set up with any reasonable adjustments you may require.

*Not all positions can accommodate changes to working hours or locations. Reach out to your Recruitment Partner if you want to know more.





Our sustainability promise



We're on a life-long journey to become an ever-more sustainable group. It's a commitment to taking care of our people and the world we live in, to doing good business, and to making a positive impact wherever we can. Our governance processes, company policies, and review systems are all geared towards our goal of making a positive impact in the world. You can read more about our sustainability work here.

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that values diversity and emphasises personal well-being.

MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

Build the future of Health. Create your life’s best work.

If healthcare were built for today, it wouldn’t resemble the reactive, fragmented system we see now. It would be proactive, personalized, and preventative - designed to optimize wellbeing and unlock human potential. Digital-first, tech-powered, with a seamless experience as innovative as Tesla and the cultural impact of Nike. At Healf, we’re not just imagining this future - we’re building it.




Our vision

Health is at a crossroads. Chronic diseases account for 86% of deaths in Europe, yet the healthcare system isn’t designed to provide the preventative, personalized care people need. At Healf, our mission is bold: to put health back in people’s hands. Through curating world-class products and our revolutionary Healf Zone platform, we’re creating a science-driven, personalized approach to preventative care that inspires better living every day. Backed by visionary investors - including those who backed Alo Yoga, Cult Beauty, Innocent Smoothies and Soho House - we’re redefining what health looks like for the world.This isn’t just a business; it’s a movement - a generational opportunity to reshape how we live.




Join us

Experience building complex financial or data models in Excel
Expertise in Excel including the use of hotkeys, shortcuts, and complex functions.

Why join Healf?

Do your life’s best work: At Healf, you’ll tackle meaningful challenges that drive real impact.

Learn from the Best: Work alongside entrepreneurial founders and a mission-driven team, with mentorship that helps you grow into the best version of yourself.




About Us

At Healf, we’re not just a company - we’re a movement. Founded by two brothers whose own health journeys inspired a mission to empower others, Healf is built on grit, determination, and a relentless commitment to excellence.




Our culture is grounded in four commandments that define how we work and win:

1. We Work Harder Than Anyone Else: Building something that improves lives takes long hours, grit, and sacrifice - but we thrive on it. We all feel energised by what we’re building.

2. Never Settle: We challenge the status quo and push ourselves to be better every day. We never settle for mediocrity or the idea that something can’t be done.

3. Obsession Over Talent: Talent alone isn’t enough - relentless curiosity and a drive to grow set us apart.

4. The Healf Lifestyle: We live what we preach - our wellbeing fuels our productivity.




With Healf Zone on the horizon, we’re entering the next phase of our journey: closing the loop on health with personalized, preventative care that unlocks longevity. This is your chance to help build something extraordinary.

Simply Business is an online business insurance brokerage that specialises in one thing: protecting the businesses their customers are working hard to build. Since they started life in 2005, they have helped over three million small businesses and self-employed people find the protection that’s right for them, from builders to bakers and personal trainers. Their big idea was to reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible, while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that they believe small businesses and landlords are entitled to.




Their story - continued commitment to doing the right thing




2005 seems like a long time ago. Simply Business – a small company with a big idea. To transform the way that other small businesses could get the insurance that they need. To reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that small businesses are entitled to. To protect them from harm. To keep their livelihoods safe. And to do all this with the promise of positive service. Delivered by happy people, working flexibly, learning constantly. With a restlessly innovative spirit. Within a business committed to doing the right thing. All of the time.




As they've grown, they've tried hard to keep true to this. To ourselves, to their 800 strong team and to the 3.5m customers that they've served so far. And as they move forward, as they enter a big new market, as they grow responsibly, as they improve their products, as they offer their customers more of what they need, of what they deserve, they'll hold onto the focus of that small company with the big idea. Protecting and serving businesses across the UK and the US. From barbers to bakers, consultants to cleaners, they are the backbone of the economy.




And they'll continue to stand by them. Bit by bit helping their dreams grow, just like ours.

Troubleshoot and optimise existing data sources.
Work together with Data Engineers to productionise valuable output from your projects to commonly used data tables.
Support and be supported by other data analysts, data scientists and data engineers through knowledge sharing and upskilling.

Experience with BI reporting tools such as Tableau or powerBI.
Experience with app analytics tools such as Google Analytics.
A good working knowledge of SQL.

Adept at data visualisation.
Be able to communicate complex quantitative analysis in a clear, precise, and actionable manner to senior management.




WHAT CAN WE OFFER YOU?

Data Analysts can work with one of the largest customer databases in Europe, holding records for over 24 million unique customers.
You will learn and grow your capabilities by working with the latest technology and services, in particular the Google Cloud Platform.
Working on a multi-functional team, you will learn and grow your capabilities in areas such as statistics, data storytelling, web, and mobile app technologies and machine learning.
Training, sharing knowledge, and best practice are integral to our team ethos. In addition to formal training courses, every individual receives an annual allowance to spend on personal development.




What rewards are on offer

Up to 30 holidays + bank holidays
Pension up to 6% employer contribution
Bonus scheme
Enhanced shared parental leave - 6 months paid for both parents

How we’ll invest in you

Interview process

There will be an initial screening call with a member of the Talent Acquisition team to run through the role and your experience. This should be around 15 minutes long. There will be two interview stages to follow which consist of;

60 minute Teams interview which includes an intro to the role, a basic SQL test and a small case study.
30 mins interview, which will cover both competency and behavioural questions.




At MONY Group, we believe in the strength of diversity and see inclusion as a strategic advantage. Our values guide us in creating a workplace where fairness and equity is a reality for all. We’re committed to minimising systemic bias and creating a level playing field for all candidates.




Contact us for reasonable accommodations in the application process, no need to disclose your disability or condition, just specify your needs. Unsure what to ask for? We can guide you through available accommodations.




We understand that job adverts only say so much and you’re likely to have a lot of questions. If you’d like to know more before applying such as more on hybrid working, salary, our parental leave policy etc, please just let us know, and we’ll be happy to help. You can contact the recruiter for this role, Kim at kim.richards@monygroup.com

What You'll Do:

You will help to manage the timetable data that powers the Citymapper application. Using proprietary tools and methods, you will transform often messy transit schedules into shiny and reliable user information.
You will build, validate and ship data to production on a daily basis.
You will manage data in a range of cities and across different formats.

You are comfortable dealing with large data sets, and have an eagerness to learn new data skills.
You take a hands-on, practical, pragmatic attitude to your work.
You have exceptional attention to detail, and an ability to communicate those details to other collaborators.
You have up to 3 years of experience working with data, Python and/or common transit data formats (GTFS, TransXChange, Siri, Hafas, etc).




What We Offer:

Becoming part of Via, a company that was awarded for its commitment to social good

Founded in 2012, Via pioneered the TransitTech category by using new technologies to develop public mobility systems — optimizing networks of buses, shuttles, wheelchair accessible vehicles, school buses, autonomous vehicles, and electric vehicles around the globe.Building the world's most efficient, equitable, and sustainable transportation network for all passengers — including those with limited mobility, those without smartphones, and unbanked populations — Via works with its partners to lower the costs of public transit while providing transportation options that rival the convenience of a personal car while reducing environmental impact.




At the intersection of transportation and technology, Via is a visionary market leader that combines software innovation with sophisticated service design and operational expertise to fundamentally improve the way the world moves, providing technology in 650 communities and more than 35 countries and counting.




We are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly.

Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,700 - C$174,100. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Chainlink Labs is the primary contributing developer of Chainlink, the decentralized computing platform powering the verifiable web. Chainlink is the industry-standard platform for providing access to real-world data, offchain computation, and secure cross-chain interoperability across any blockchain. Chainlink Labs helps power verifiable applications for banking, DeFi, global trade, and gaming by collaborating with some of the world’s largest financial institutions, notably Swift, DTCC, and ANZ. Chainlink Labs also works with top Web3 teams, including Aave, Compound, GMX, Maker, and Synthetix. Chainlink Labs was ranked in Newsweek’s 100 Most Loved Workplaces 2023 in both the United States and United Kingdom.

Chainlink Labs is pioneering the world’s first fully sustainable and decentralized oracle network, and the Economics team is searching for a Senior Analyst to play a critical role in building it. This role will sit at the intersection of blockchain technology, financial innovation, and economic systems, and shape the future of decentralized economics.

As a Senior Analyst, you will combine economics, data science, and blockchain expertise to shape incentives, optimize network design, and influence the decision-making of our Economics and Executive Leadership teams. You will design, analyze, and operationalize economic models for production applications. You will collaborate across departments to bring innovative solutions from concept to production, ensuring economic soundness and scalability throughout.

This is a high-impact role, offering visibility and influence as you contribute to the development of the Chainlink network. If you’re a meticulous, creative, and motivated individual ready to solve complex economic problems through data-driven decisions in the rapidly evolving world of Web3, this is the role for you.

Your Impact


You'll serve two primary functions: (1) designing and performing analyses that help the Economics and Executive Leadership teams make informed, data-driven decisions, and (2) building and maintaining systems for the parameterization of production applications.
You'll work on a wide array of blockchain economics projects, analyses, and systems, including:
Designing novel mechanisms and incentive schemes
Building models and simulations to evaluate investment opportunities
Designing and parameterizing trading systems
Optimizing parameters for production applications
Contributing to the design of Economics programs and applications
You'll optimize network incentives and systems by engaging directly with the Economics, Product, Engineering, Research, and Data Science teams to understand network dynamics at the deepest level.
You'll operationalize processes and analytics systems, and coordinate cross-functionally to implement them.
This is both a highly technical and highly social role. You will have high visibility and a large impact on how Chainlink builds the world’s first fully sustainable decentralized oracle network.

Requirements


5+ years experience in a quantitative role, particularly trading or quant research
A deep understanding of financial and crypto markets and incentives
Extensive financial modeling background, including data engineering and model automation
Strong SQL and Python skills are mandatory
Experience solving economic problems through statistical/econometric analyses
Substantial data analysis and/or data science experience
Meticulous attention to detail.


Preferred Qualifications


Strong Economics and/or Finance background through Masters-level academics and/or multiple years of industry experience.
Strong organizational and coordination skills necessary to productionize/operationalize processes and applications.
Preferably smart contract programming experience (Rust, Go, Solidity), but familiarity with smart contract code and dApp architecture at a minimum
Published research with an economics or crypto focus (e.g., papers on MEV or PBS, staking and slashing dynamics, node compensation, tokenomics, etc.)


All roles with Chainlink Labs are global and remote-based. Unless otherwise stated, we ask that you try to overlap some working hours with Eastern Standard Time (EST).

Commitment to Equal Opportunity
