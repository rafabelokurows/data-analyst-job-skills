Build the Future of Data – Join our Team!




Our Data Cloud is transforming how businesses discover, integrate, and leverage data products. Through our Marketplace, organizations can seamlessly access valuable datasets, applications, and AI models.




At the heart of this ecosystem is Secure Data Sharing, enabling providers and consumers to publish, discover, and monetize data and services. Instead of relying on traditional delivery methods like files and APIs, providers leverage Data Sharing to distribute their data efficiently. Marketplace and Data Sharing are central to our vision, fueling the network effect of our Data Cloud.




As a temporary worker on the Collaboration & Marketplace team, you will play a key role in shaping our internal content arm—curating public data into scalable, high-quality products that enhance our customers’ analytics capabilities. Public datasets—spanning finance, economics, government, and weather—are critical for businesses across industries.

As a Data Analyst, you will be responsible to monitor the public data pipelines daily and help address/fix errors promptly, allowing customers to rely on this data for their business operations.




Responsibilities:

Monitor data pipelines for failures (formatting, source, duplicative data, etc).
Investigate errors by analyzing logs, GitHub repositories, provider websites, and SQL queries to pinpoint issues.
Engage with public data providers when issues arise on their end, ensuring swift resolution.
Proactively improve data pipelines to improve data integrity and reduce errors.
Maintain strict SLAs (e.g., 4-hour response time) and aim for 0% error rate at the end of each day.
Collaborate with the Data Engineering team in daily scrum meetings.
Identify and implement process improvements to enhance efficiency and reliability.

Our platform helps companies to be the best versions of themselves through financial incentives and proven frameworks. That's where you come in.

As a Data Analyst, you will work with the Data Science team building analytical processes to enable traditional machine learning techniques, as well as AI systems in automated decision making.

Develop techniques to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of AI-driven data-extraction and synthesis
Present your work, findings, and opinions to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Support the usage of new data sources in automated decisions (e.g. web scraping, public/private APIs,) in a manner that minimizes development cycles while maximizing potential business applications.
Continuously challenge how we can improve our underwriting while reducing the number of questions that need to be answered in an application.
Maintain a clean production environment such that the data models can be easily interpreted and built upon by other data science and engineering team members.
Build and support a team of data scientists and analysts to accelerate our learnings and elevate our product offerings.

Experience using Python to perform analytics and reporting
A track record of exceptional individual contributions leading to meaningful impact (as measured by a key metrics)
Exceptional communication with non-technical stakeholders
Strong time management and organization skills; ability to commit to medium-long term deadlines and up-front clear communication around whether or not the schedule is on-track
A strong understanding of how to add business value
Ability to embrace an effective, but imperfect recommendation
Familiarity with and interest in traditional machine learning and AI
Bias to practical action and creativity using data (we value past or present projects that support this).


WHO YOU WILL WORK WITH:


Tobias Schuler, Head of Data & Analytics: Tobias was previously the Head of Data and Analytics at Digital Partners, a Munich Re company. Tobias led a team that built out data integrations, business intelligence and advanced analytics across all insurtech partners spanning various P&C lines of businesses.

COUNTERPART'S VALUES


Conjoin Expectations - it is the cornerstone of autonomy. Ensure you are aware of what is expected of you and clearly articulate what you expect of others.
Speak Boldly & Honestly - the only failure is not learning from mistakes. Don't cheat yourself and your colleagues of the feedback needed when expectations aren't being met.
Be Entrepreneurial - control your own destiny. Embrace action over perfection while navigating any obstacles that stand in the way of your ultimate goal.
Practice Omotenashi (""selfless hospitality"") - trust will follow. Consider every interaction with internal and external partners an opportunity to develop trust by going above and beyond what is expected.
Hold Nothing As Sacred - create routines but modify them routinely. Take the time to reflect on where the business is today, where it needs to go, and what you have to change in order to get there.
Prioritize Wellness - some things should never be sacrificed. We create an environment that stretches everyone to grow and improve, which is fulfilling, but is only one part of a meaningful life.


Our estimated pay range for this role is $130,000 to $160,000. Base salary is determined by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, market data, location, internal equitability, and experience.

We are committed to being a welcoming and inclusive workplace for everyone, and we are intentional about making sure people feel respected, supported and connected at work—regardless of who you are or where you come from. We value and celebrate our differences and we believe being open about who we are allows us to do the best work of our lives.

Privacy Statement




All member records are protected according to our Privacy Policy. Further, while employees of Headspace (formerly Ginger) cannot access Headspace products/services, they will be offered benefits according to the company's benefit plan. To ensure we are adhering to best practice and ethical guidelines in the field of mental health, we take care to avoid dual relationships. A dual relationship occurs when a mental health care provider has a second, significantly different relationship with their client in addition to the traditional client-therapist relationship—including, for example, a managerial relationship.  




As such, Headspace requests that individuals who have received coaching or clinical services at Headspace wait until their care with Headspace is complete before applying for a position. If someone with a Headspace account is hired for a position, please note their account will be deactivated and they will not be able to use Headspace services for the duration of their employment. 




Further, if Headspace cannot find a role that fails to resolve an ethical issue associated with a dual relationship, Headspace may need to take steps to ensure ethical obligations are being adhered to, including a delayed start date or a potential leave of absence. Such steps would be taken to protect both the former member, as well as any relevant individuals from their care team, from impairment, risk of exploitation, or harm.

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have an absolute love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem, and living inside a spreadsheet/data set to find the answer to any question.
Because you love data, you have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis. Experience with Marketing APIs, Big Query or other Cloud Data Warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.), ETL Tools (Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics) and/or Python are all pluses.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and have spent a minimum of 1 year working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.




What You’ll Do:

Reporting: With your expertise in Advanced Excel, SQL, Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools, you’ll be maintaining customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence, generating pivot tables and other visualizations that summarize thousands of lines of data. You should have experience in translating performance media metrics into coherent, digestible reports for client ad campaigns and be comfortable communicating via Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.
Strategy: You’ll be responsible for learning our clients’ businesses and aligning their media strategy with business goals as well as understanding advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to help guide media buying strategy. With a background in paid media and/or digital advertising, you understand concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue and are able to be engaged in discussions with clients to gain trust and shareholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.




Gupta Media is an office-first (with flexibility) organization and we are excited to have our team working together again

Make recommendations on how to better visualize data and update existing Looker Studio dashboards to reflect changing business needs.

Cross Functional:

Excellent ability to communicate complex data concepts and insights across all levels of the organization via written and verbal communication.
Leverage a strong understanding of the business to inform what projects should be prioritized and will make the greatest impact on the business.
Proactively manage stakeholder expectations to keep leaders informed and up to date on ad-hoc requests, in-progress deliverables, and impactful changes to the data infrastructure.




What You Need to Succeed:

Criteo uses massive commerce datasets to help advertisers and media owners reach their goals. As a Data Analyst on the Client Focused Analytics team, you will work with Criteo's biggest US clients to understand how they measure the value of their marketing efforts. You will analyze shopping behavior on client websites, apps, and physical stores. By combining this with Criteo's marketing data, you will have the opportunity to create compelling data-driven recommendations to help our biggest advertisers maximize the value they see from their Criteo investment.

With 2,600 collaborators worldwide, Criteo is large enough to provide exciting career advancement options, as well as regular opportunities to work with international peers. At the same time, it’s not so big that your individual contributions will go unnoticed - you won’t be another brick in the wall here.

Criteo (and the ad-tech industry at large) is being quickly disrupted, which brings the opportunity to create new and innovative products that will help fund the open internet. If you have ever accessed a free news website that is funded by ads, this is what is at stake, and if keeping that alive motivates you, Criteo might just be the right place for you!


Make smart and careful use of SQL to query massive Hive and Vertica databases (we don't use the term massive lightly: our clusters store close to 171 PB of data, with tens of TB of new data stored daily)
Frequently interact with commercial teams and clients to share data-driven recommendations and insights regarding their marketing efforts
Maintain deep knowledge of Criteo products and technologies as they evolve
Support the testing of new Criteo products and improvements to core Criteo technology by doing marketing performance analysis and troubleshooting
Manage controlled incrementality A/B tests from design, to execution, to analysis and presentation of results
Occasionally use Tableau and Python to automate data analyses, build scalable insights and design impactful visualizations



Who You Are:


Minimum 1 year full-time, analytics-relevant work experience with SQL
Native-level English fluency and strong presentation and public speaking skills, with the ability to present and defend complex analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Bachelor’s degree or higher in a quantitative field (Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering, etc.)
Conceptual and practical understanding of statistics and real-world application of statistical concepts particularly in a testing context
Experience with internet advertising technology (tagging, cookies, trafficking) and digital marketing concepts is preferred



We acknowledge that many candidates may not meet every single role requirement listed above. If your experience looks a little different from our requirements but you believe that you can still bring value to the role, we’d love to see your application!

Bain Capital Partnership Strategies was formed in 2005, initially to find investments for the personal capital of Bain Capital’s partners. Our Boston-based team combines rigorous fundamental research, deep experience across asset classes, and a global perspective to make unique investments that are not widely available. Partnership Strategies began accepting external capital in 2018 and currently manages ~$2.5 billion of assets on behalf of a diverse set of LPs.

The Partnership Strategies Fund (PSF) is a multi-strategy hedge fund with a differentiated investment approach. The Fund utilizes off-market sourcing, detailed underwriting, and a long-term time horizon to create a diversified portfolio of hard-to-access investments that generate returns uncorrelated to equity markets.

We are currently looking for people to participate in our Menu Photo Collection project Finch.




What is the project about?

This project collects photos, live photos and short videos of menus (takeout menus, menus at restaurants, menus at boards, etc.). The photos collected will be used to support the development of technological products and services, including photo/video recognition services and artificial intelligence features.




This project can be a lot of fun! You can check your cabinets at home for takeaway menus, pick paper menus from your grocery store, go to a restaurant and check the dessert menu (even if you do not have a sweet tooth!), walk down the street and have a look at the chalkboard or the menu hanging at the door of an eatery. You can explore the almost unlimited variety of menus out there, dedicate a few minutes photographing them, and earn money you can spend on anything, even perhaps your next meal out!




Who is eligible?

To participate you should meet the following qualifying criteria:

Be 18 years or older.
Residing in the USA
Have an iPhone with iOS 17 or later with a functional camera.




Where is the project taking place?

This is a fully remote project. Note: all the photos should be taken within the USA.




How much is the compensation?

$0.80 USD per menu. For each menu you will need to take 2 photos. Due to the nature of the project, you will be able to participate many times with a variety of menus easy to obtain!




As payment method, we offer PayPal, Gift Card, Check and Wire Transfer according to your preference.




Please note that our Quality Assurance team will review all submissions to ensure they meet the project specific requirements. The project team will provide you with feedback once the Quality Check process is completed.




Questions or doubts?

If you have any doubts or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at: DataForce.Sourcing@transperfect.com
