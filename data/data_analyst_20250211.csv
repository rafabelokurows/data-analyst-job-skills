________________________

Hello 👋 I am Puneet, Co- founder and CPO at Kayzen, and I am now looking for a Lead Data Analyst who will be a part of the our Data Analytics ( Data ) team. 🙌

But wait, you have not heard of Kayzen before? 😃

Kayzen is a mobile demand-side platform (DSP) dedicated to democratizing programmatic advertising. We enable leading apps, agencies, media buyers, and brands to run programmatic customer acquisition, retargeting, and brand performance campaigns through its self-serve and managed service options.

Built on the three core pillars of performance, transparency, and control, Kayzen powers the world's best mobile marketing teams with bespoke solutions that fuel business growth and deliver a competitive advantage.

With an unprecedented scale of 160B+ daily ad requests from 1.6B+ unique users worldwide, we serve up to 1B+ ads per day in 180 countries. Kayzen is accessible through our APIs and user interface.

The role

As the Lead Data Analyst, you will ensure that the Data Analytics team consistently applies advanced descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive analytics to deliver high-value insights across multiple stakeholders. At Kayzen, our Data Analytics team operates within the broader ""Data Team,"" which also includes Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering. Collectively, the Data Team develops and deploys the machine learning models that power our clients' advertising performance in the programmatic ecosystem.

Within this structure, the Data Analytics team serves as a critical bridge between the Data Team and the broader business units (e.g., campaign managers, business owners, product managers).

Through your leadership, you will champion a data-driven culture and empower teams across Kayzen to harness analytical insights in a consistent and impactful way.

Responsibilities

As a hands-on leader, you will combine technical prowess with strategic vision—driving complex analysis, mentoring team members, and tackling data challenges directly. You will address a variety of problems, such as feature engineering, A/B testing, fraud detection, bidding decisions to name a few examples. Your key responsibilities include:


Team Leadership & Mentorship: Guide and develop the Data Analytics team, ensuring the quality and impact of their deliverables.
Roadmap Definition: Shape both the Data Analytics roadmap and the broader Data Team roadmap, making decisions that align with business priorities and objectives.
Data-Driven Model Research: Provide in-depth research to inform machine learning model development, leveraging both internal and external data sources to generate actionable insights.
Analytical & Statistical Expertise: Serve as the primary source of rigorous analytics for various data problems, evaluating system performance , finding performance issues and devising solutions for them
Data Accessibility & Quality Control: Facilitate data access throughout the organization while maintaining a centralized oversight to guarantee data quality.


What this role is not about:


This is not a typical BI role, where you are just expected to receive requirements and build dashboards. At Kayzen, the Data Analyst role is more investigative and we need people capable to ask questions and to answer them.
This is not a campaign management role, where you will be responsible for operational campaign optimization.


Requirements


5+ years of experience in the Ad-Tech industry, working in Data Analytics or related fields;
SQL (advanced);
Python (intermediate);
Expertise in data mining, processing, modeling and data visualization and strong analytical skills;
A results-driven, hands-on mindset that combines rapid experimentation, pragmatic problem-solving, and a passion for delivering exceptional customer-focused solutions;
High level of proactiveness and eagerness to solve issues;
A strong sense of ownership and strong work ethics;
Experience with Big Data technologies (Spark, HDFS, Hive, etc) is a plus;
Experience with Git and Airflow is a plus.


What do we offer?


Reporting directly to Co-founder & CPO
Direct access to top management and an extremely ""visible"" role
Exceptional career growth and learning opportunity
A unique opportunity to be part of an experienced team of industry experts and entrepreneurs who bring massive change to the Adtech market
Direct, day-to-day work experience with the management
A fun, driven, and multinational team located across Germany, India, UK, Argentina, Ukraine, Turkey, Spain and many more countries
A flexible work-from-home arrangement
A 500-dollar home-office setup budget
A 1000-dollar annual learning and development budget

Job Description

Omio is rapidly expanding its product offerings across all of its markets and is looking to grow its capabilities and improve the efficiency of how we enable the use of data to drive fast, accurate decision-making across the business.

Build forecasting models to understand gaps in current performance and sales/revenue optimization models to enhance margins without negatively impacting user experience
Perform statistical analyses - including A/B tests and pre/post analyses
Correlate marketing/product/commercial data to derive key insights
Work with our data engineering/business intelligence teams to build data models, which best summarise and utilise our production data
Act as an advocate of our company’s data-driven culture: produce reports that are actionable, dashboards that are diagnostic, and recommendations that drive growth


Qualifications

A successful candidate will be:


Passionate about continuous improvement.
An excellent stakeholder manager with great communication and presentation skills.
Enthusiastic, with a sense of pride in the work delivered and the quality of how it was delivered.
An open and honest individual who both welcomes and provides feedback in a way that is constructive and thoughtful.
Highly collaborative with fantastic facilitation skills at team and department level.
Comfortable with flexibility, ambiguity and changing priorities.
Value and outcome-driven, with a positive “can-do” attitude.


A Successful Candidate Will Have


Minimum 5 years of experience as a product or data analyst, ideally in the tech start-up/scale-up environment.
Ideally some experience of B2B or B2B2C environments.
Experience in working with European travel providers would be a significant advantage.
Experience of line management, leading and developing a small team.
Strong analytical thinking with a structured approach to problem-solving.
Experienced in using SQL extensively.
Strong communication skills and a proven track record of collaborating effectively within cross-functional teams
Strong business intuition and a data-driven mindset to drive impactful solutions that meet strategic objectives. Communicate complex insights clearly and collaborate seamlessly with senior management to support decision-making
Bonus points if you have:
GCP, BigQuery, Looker, Python, Spark

________________________

Hello 👋 I am Puneet, Co- founder and CPO at Kayzen, and I am now looking for a Lead Data Analyst who will be a part of the our Data Analytics ( Data ) team. 🙌

But wait, you have not heard of Kayzen before? 😃

Kayzen is a mobile demand-side platform (DSP) dedicated to democratizing programmatic advertising. We enable leading apps, agencies, media buyers, and brands to run programmatic customer acquisition, retargeting, and brand performance campaigns through its self-serve and managed service options.

Built on the three core pillars of performance, transparency, and control, Kayzen powers the world's best mobile marketing teams with bespoke solutions that fuel business growth and deliver a competitive advantage.

With an unprecedented scale of 160B+ daily ad requests from 1.6B+ unique users worldwide, we serve up to 1B+ ads per day in 180 countries. Kayzen is accessible through our APIs and user interface.

The role

As the Lead Data Analyst, you will ensure that the Data Analytics team consistently applies advanced descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive analytics to deliver high-value insights across multiple stakeholders. At Kayzen, our Data Analytics team operates within the broader ""Data Team,"" which also includes Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering. Collectively, the Data Team develops and deploys the machine learning models that power our clients' advertising performance in the programmatic ecosystem.

Within this structure, the Data Analytics team serves as a critical bridge between the Data Team and the broader business units (e.g., campaign managers, business owners, product managers).

Through your leadership, you will champion a data-driven culture and empower teams across Kayzen to harness analytical insights in a consistent and impactful way.

Responsibilities

As a hands-on leader, you will combine technical prowess with strategic vision—driving complex analysis, mentoring team members, and tackling data challenges directly. You will address a variety of problems, such as feature engineering, A/B testing, fraud detection, bidding decisions to name a few examples. Your key responsibilities include:


Team Leadership & Mentorship: Guide and develop the Data Analytics team, ensuring the quality and impact of their deliverables.
Roadmap Definition: Shape both the Data Analytics roadmap and the broader Data Team roadmap, making decisions that align with business priorities and objectives.
Data-Driven Model Research: Provide in-depth research to inform machine learning model development, leveraging both internal and external data sources to generate actionable insights.
Analytical & Statistical Expertise: Serve as the primary source of rigorous analytics for various data problems, evaluating system performance , finding performance issues and devising solutions for them
Data Accessibility & Quality Control: Facilitate data access throughout the organization while maintaining a centralized oversight to guarantee data quality.


What this role is not about:


This is not a typical BI role, where you are just expected to receive requirements and build dashboards. At Kayzen, the Data Analyst role is more investigative and we need people capable to ask questions and to answer them.
This is not a campaign management role, where you will be responsible for operational campaign optimization.


Requirements


5+ years of experience in the Ad-Tech industry, working in Data Analytics or related fields;
SQL (advanced);
Python (intermediate);
Expertise in data mining, processing, modeling and data visualization and strong analytical skills;
A results-driven, hands-on mindset that combines rapid experimentation, pragmatic problem-solving, and a passion for delivering exceptional customer-focused solutions;
High level of proactiveness and eagerness to solve issues;
A strong sense of ownership and strong work ethics;
Experience with Big Data technologies (Spark, HDFS, Hive, etc) is a plus;
Experience with Git and Airflow is a plus.


What do we offer?


Reporting directly to Co-founder & CPO
Direct access to top management and an extremely ""visible"" role
Exceptional career growth and learning opportunity
A unique opportunity to be part of an experienced team of industry experts and entrepreneurs who bring massive change to the Adtech market
Direct, day-to-day work experience with the management
A fun, driven, and multinational team located across Germany, India, UK, Argentina, Ukraine, Turkey, Spain and many more countries
A flexible work-from-home arrangement
A 500-dollar home-office setup budget
A 1000-dollar annual learning and development budget

Native German skills are required.

🌎 What we do

We build software that helps companies along the food system get to Net Zero.

~31% of global GHG emissions originate from food-related activities. For the first time in history, climate performance has become an overall business performance indicator. Enterprises are mandated by regulatory bodies to disclose their climate performance, which leads to increasing pressure from investors, competitors, retailers, and consumers to prevent and reduce their CO2e emissions. Over the next 10 years, companies have set ambitious reduction targets that need to be met. Enterprise software and new business processes can help.

We raised >€10m in funding in the first 2 years of our existence, we launched our enterprise product, signed and onboarded some of the largest F&B players in Europe, and put together what we believe is the best-suited early stage tech team in Europe. Will you be the next to join us? 🚀

🔭 What you will work on

Your mission

Help our users make sense of their data and pave the way to Net Zero Emissions.

Over the next 12 months you will:


Create Actionable Insights for Net Zero
Identify data patterns to help users understand and communicate their carbon footprints more effectively to customers and suppliers.
Turn emission data into clear, impactful analytics for users so they can make better decisions.
Bridge data to real-world measures - our users and farmers don’t live in spreadsheets.
Build Prototypes and Products
Develop models and prototypes to help clients set targets and model Net Zero scenarios.
Develop a strong understanding of our users and their unique challenges.
Work closely with the product team to transform prototypes into scalable SaaS products.
Upskill the Team with Data & AI
Stay up-to-date with the latest trends in data analytics and AI product building.
Empower self-service across teams.
Foster a data-first culture in a fast-growing environment where it’s easy to simply listen to your gut feeling.

🚀 You might be really good for this role if


You have a ""get-it-done"" attitude and the ability to learn really fast.
You have built products from scratch in the past, be it on your own or as part of a bigger undertaking inside your company.
You were part of the first 1-50 employees at an early stage technology company, no matter in what position.
You understand and care equally as much about the “why” behind the numbers, you think outcome-first.
You are highly reliable and can organise your work really well.


You don't feel like you fulfil all the criteria? We get it: confidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. But guess what?! There is no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. The only thing you need to ensure along the recruiting process and beyond is that the problem that we are solving with Root is one you cannot wait to get out of bed for on Monday morning! 🤗

Here, we turn dreams into stardom and audiences into fans. We are guided by three core values that underpin everything we do across all our diverse businesses:


Curiosity: We do our best work when we’re immersing ourselves in culture and breaking through barriers. Curiosity is the driving force behind creativity and ingenuity. It fuels innovation, and innovation is the key to our future.

Consider a career at WMG and get the best of both worlds – an innovative global music company that retains the creative spirit of a nimble independent.

Job Title: Junior Data Analyst, 12 Month Contract

A Little Bit About Our Team

Our team of 4 handles the processing and invoicing of Warner’s worldwide digital sales, as well as reporting these sales to our affiliates worldwide for onward royalty accounting to our artists. We work very closely with a number of other departments, namely IT, Royalties, Business Development, Business Affairs and Finance.

Why This Could Be Your Next Big Break

You’ll be responsible for loading the streaming & download sales we’ve received from our digital providers, like Spotify, iTunes/Apple Music, Tidal and Deezer – to eventually get paid through to our Artists. You’ll also be clearing through any errored transactions that have ended up in suspense, making sure our Artists receive all of the revenue for sales they’ve made. You’ll be working at your own pace and have the freedom to complete tasks in the way that works for you, and have plenty of support from the rest of the team.

Here You’ll Get To


Work with large sets of data, and develop skills to analyse and transform data sets of varying sizes, from small to huge.
Learn about databases, data structures, and digital sales transactions of our repertoire – and how we go from the sale of an album, single or stream through to getting the royalty paid to the artist, and how the pricing of each stream/download is calculated.
Talk with our labels and our worldwide affiliates to resolve any queries that may pop up, or with our digital streaming / download platforms.


About You


You have a high level of proficiency with Microsoft Excel, familiar with its built-in functions.
You have a self-driven attitude to work, able to set your own deadlines, work independently, and communicate professionally with any of our external customers.
You have an analytical mindset, with the ability to see the “bigger picture” within large sets of data.
You have strong attention to detail and are extremely thorough.
You have good, proven education credentials with subjects such as Maths, IT, Economics or English, and are able to understand basic economic concepts such as foreign exchange rates.
You have an open approach to work, and the ability to adapt to a rapidly changing, developing and moving environment.


It would be music to our ears if you also had:


Experience working with databases and large sets of data.
Familiarity with scripting languages such as Python, particularly the Pandas library.
A self-motivated candidate with good communication skills who can problem solve and find solutions.


About Us

As the home to Asylum, Atlantic, East West, Elektra, FFRR, Fueled by Ramen, Nonesuch, Parlophone, Rhino, Roadrunner, Sire, Warner Records, Warner Classics, and several other of the world’s premier recording labels, Warner Music Group champions emerging artists and global superstars alike.

Your title will be Data Analyst
This role pays £50k-£80k/year + equity
Matt, Cofounder and CTO, is the hiring manager
We work Mon-Thu in our office in Chancery Lane, London


What are we building? An AI Executive Assistant

In 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that we'd only be working 15 hours a week by 2030. Despite automation in agriculture and industry, that hasn't happened.

Why? The service sector. Walk around the average office and you'll see people's days taken up by emails, Slack and meetings instead of real work.

People in client facing roles - sales, professional services firms, recruiters - feel this most acutely. Instead of advising clients, they spend hours on admin. Following up. Scheduling meetings and taking notes on them. Answering repetitive questions over email.

We've built an AI executive assistant that looks at your emails, messages and meetings, and uses that knowledge to answer your email, schedule meetings, take next steps from meetings and organise your inbox.

Unlike other startups, we're a pure-play applied AI company, not a SaaS company with AI features hastily bolted on! We make use of the best techniques (fine tuned open source models, tool use, and retrieval augmented generation) and as a result, users send 53% of the email drafts we generate.

How has it been going?

Since launching in March 2024, we've gone from $0 to $2.5m in revenue across 3000 paid users. We did this with a team of 4, and without using any paid marketing until November.

We spent Q4 2024 in San Francisco at HF0, the best AI startup accelerator in the world, learning from experts like the CEO of Instacart, Head of Applied Research at OpenAI and the cofounder of Snowflake.

What do we value?

We're very intentional about adding new people. We think a small team of exceptional people working hard at a problem they care about will always beat a larger, more unfocused team. That means you'll need to bring an intensity to this role that might not be asked at other companies. But it also means you will be fast tracked into more senior roles and responsibilities far earlier.

We also believe in hiring people who want ownership and autonomy in their work, and giving it to them. Instead of just being handed tickets, you'll be proactively suggesting metrics that should be monitored and one off analyses that should be done, and proposing improvements to our analytics infrastructure.

What will I do?


Running analyses in SQL to make decisions on product, marketing spend, and pricing strategy, and communicating your findings, method, and recommendations in a clear way to both technical and non-technical audiences
Working with stakeholders in the marketing, sales, customer success and product departments to agree metrics that need to be monitored on an ongoing basis, then building visualisations
Working with data engineers to ensure data is modelled in the correct format to support data visualisation and more detailed analyses


What does our ideal hire look like?

You've worked at an early stage tech company (<100 people) as a data analyst or similar
You have an expert level understanding of both SQL and a data visualization tool (we use Metabase). If you don't know SQL to a very high standard, you shouldn't apply
You are excellent at communicating your analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences: the results, your recommendations, and the method you used
You can proactively structure an analysis given only a business problem
Urgency and intensity in your work


Our tech stack

Broadly, we use a fairly typical ELT stack. It's not a requirement to have worked with every tool we use, but the more the better!


BigQuery as our data warehouse
Metabase for data visualization
Fivetran to pipe raw data from third party tools (eg Stripe, which we use for billing) into our data warehouse
dbt hosted on Github Actions for transformation of raw data into production tables ready for consumption
Census for reverse ETL


The application process


Submit your CV (no need for a cover letter)
An initial call with someone from the Fyxer AI team to review your experience and motivation for joining (15 mins)
Live coding exercise - SQL (30 minutes)
Analytical case study (45 minutes)
Meet Richard - CEO (30 minutes)

About you: 👀

As a Data Analyst, your role is pivotal in driving data-driven decisions within Vable and ensuring our success with the data provided. In addition to our essential criteria we will be looking for the following mindset:


You're passionate about using data to solve complex problems and drive impactful change
You're self-motivated, work independently and take pride in delivering high-quality, impactful analysis
You proactively identify patterns, risks, and opportunities to build scalable, data-driven solutions
You're curious about how things work and how you can improve them
You're a collaborator who can build relationships across multiple teams, in an honest and meaningful way
You're structured and like organisation
You've an excellent work ethic and can manage workloads well
You are able to work effectively within a remote team, it can have its challenges



To be successful in this role, your values matter just as much as skills. Does this sound like you? ✨

🟢We are Kind and Empathetic = Our behaviour and words assume the best in people

🟢We are Always A Team = We are bound together by accountability

🟢We are Curious = A bunch from various backgrounds. We ask questions, plan things out, push the boundaries, challenge the status quo and welcome creativity

🟢We Take Ownership & Deliver = We are focused on our goals and love the details

✅Why work for Vable?


You want ownership of the Data Analytics within Vable
We have a culture that we protect, we value the contributions each Vabler makes
We encourage constant learning so you can keep up to date. A yearly budget of £250 is made available to each Vable employee for continuous learning and development
We encourage creativity and like new ideas and concentrate on the Cultural Add, not fit
We provide comprehensive healthcare cover following probation
You receive a MacBook, monitor and other required technical equipment when you join
33 days of paid leave a year inclusive of statutory holidays, based on where you live
Access to an Employee Assistance Programme through Oliva
We like our virtual socials and really do like to get to know everyone in the team
We are well established; we have been around for 20 years


❌Why it may not be for you:


We are a 40 hour week, Mon-Fri and have core hours, unless stated otherwise or agreed. Being a small remote team, it's how we operate
We have set norms and behaviours and each Vabler is expected to live up to these
While your primary focus will be on data analytics, you'll collaborate with various departments, addressing diverse needs and functions while adapting to shifting priorities. If you prefer a narrowly defined role, this may not be the right fit
We have various meetings per week and people are expected to attend and contribute
Our roles are quite generalist and you will be expected to do areas that you perhaps don't like or feel is not your job. No Vabler has this attitude and we get stuck in and pull our sleeves up. If this isn't you, best not apply.
Everyone has the opportunity to query, ask questions, have new ideas and we will give you our opinion. We operate on continuous feedback and recognition. This isn't for everyone and if this makes you uncomfortable or it's not your thing, this may not be the right fit
We are very transparent and all work is stored on shared drives. Colleagues will give input and it's expected that you will actively adhere to this approach



Interview Process 💌


Intro Call: You will meet a member of the People team for an initial discussion about your background, motivations and experience
Interview: If after the intro call, we're excited to proceed, you will be invited to a second stage interview with the Head of Product & Technology and another applicable manager. This stage will involve a task
Final Interview: Will be with the Head of Product & Technology


🎥 We record all of our interviews, with your permission. It makes it easier as we are globally distributed.

Simply Business is an online business insurance brokerage that specialises in one thing: protecting the businesses their customers are working hard to build. Since they started life in 2005, they have helped over three million small businesses and self-employed people find the protection that’s right for them, from builders to bakers and personal trainers. Their big idea was to reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible, while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that they believe small businesses and landlords are entitled to.




Their story - continued commitment to doing the right thing




2005 seems like a long time ago. Simply Business – a small company with a big idea. To transform the way that other small businesses could get the insurance that they need. To reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that small businesses are entitled to. To protect them from harm. To keep their livelihoods safe. And to do all this with the promise of positive service. Delivered by happy people, working flexibly, learning constantly. With a restlessly innovative spirit. Within a business committed to doing the right thing. All of the time.




As they've grown, they've tried hard to keep true to this. To ourselves, to their 800 strong team and to the 3.5m customers that they've served so far. And as they move forward, as they enter a big new market, as they grow responsibly, as they improve their products, as they offer their customers more of what they need, of what they deserve, they'll hold onto the focus of that small company with the big idea. Protecting and serving businesses across the UK and the US. From barbers to bakers, consultants to cleaners, they are the backbone of the economy.




And they'll continue to stand by them. Bit by bit helping their dreams grow, just like ours.

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that values diversity and emphasises personal well-being.

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

Simply Business is an online business insurance brokerage that specialises in one thing: protecting the businesses their customers are working hard to build. Since they started life in 2005, they have helped over three million small businesses and self-employed people find the protection that’s right for them, from builders to bakers and personal trainers. Their big idea was to reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible, while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that they believe small businesses and landlords are entitled to.




Their story - continued commitment to doing the right thing




2005 seems like a long time ago. Simply Business – a small company with a big idea. To transform the way that other small businesses could get the insurance that they need. To reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that small businesses are entitled to. To protect them from harm. To keep their livelihoods safe. And to do all this with the promise of positive service. Delivered by happy people, working flexibly, learning constantly. With a restlessly innovative spirit. Within a business committed to doing the right thing. All of the time.




As they've grown, they've tried hard to keep true to this. To ourselves, to their 800 strong team and to the 3.5m customers that they've served so far. And as they move forward, as they enter a big new market, as they grow responsibly, as they improve their products, as they offer their customers more of what they need, of what they deserve, they'll hold onto the focus of that small company with the big idea. Protecting and serving businesses across the UK and the US. From barbers to bakers, consultants to cleaners, they are the backbone of the economy.




And they'll continue to stand by them. Bit by bit helping their dreams grow, just like ours.

Particular focus will be on use cases that will help them drive operational efficiencies as the organization scales.
Increase the organization's ability to convert more customers.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for fresh graduates who meet the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Enrolled in a quantitative Master’s program (e.g. Business Intelligence Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2024 or spring/summer 2025
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights



Preferred Qualifications


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects
Ability to learn new systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, San Francisco Bay Area, or New York City. We are hiring these positions in Chicago, IL or Toronto, Ontario, Canada.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$181,700. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Chainlink Labs is the primary contributing developer of Chainlink, the decentralized computing platform powering the verifiable web. Chainlink is the industry-standard platform for providing access to real-world data, offchain computation, and secure cross-chain interoperability across any blockchain. Chainlink Labs helps power verifiable applications for banking, DeFi, global trade, and gaming by collaborating with some of the world’s largest financial institutions, notably Swift, DTCC, and ANZ. Chainlink Labs also works with top Web3 teams, including Aave, Compound, GMX, Maker, and Synthetix. Chainlink Labs was ranked in Newsweek’s 100 Most Loved Workplaces 2023 in both the United States and United Kingdom.

Chainlink Labs is pioneering the world’s first fully sustainable and decentralized oracle network, and the Economics team is searching for a Senior Analyst to play a critical role in building it. This role will sit at the intersection of blockchain technology, financial innovation, and economic systems, and shape the future of decentralized economics.

As a Senior Analyst, you will combine economics, data science, and blockchain expertise to shape incentives, optimize network design, and influence the decision-making of our Economics and Executive Leadership teams.

Designing novel mechanisms and incentive schemes
Building models and simulations to evaluate investment opportunities
Designing and parameterizing trading systems
Optimizing parameters for production applications
Contributing to the design of Economics programs and applications
You'll optimize network incentives and systems by engaging directly with the Economics, Product, Engineering, Research, and Data Science teams to understand network dynamics at the deepest level.
You'll operationalize processes and analytics systems, and coordinate cross-functionally to implement them.
This is both a highly technical and highly social role. You will have high visibility and a large impact on how Chainlink builds the world’s first fully sustainable decentralized oracle network.

Requirements


5+ years experience in a quantitative role, particularly trading or quant research
A deep understanding of financial and crypto markets and incentives
Extensive financial modeling background, including data engineering and model automation

Our Purpose

At Deloitte, we are driven to inspire and help our people, organization, communities, and country to thrive. Our Purpose is to build a better future by accelerating and expanding access to knowledge. Purpose defines who we are and gives us reason to exist as an organization.

By living our Purpose, we will make an impact that matters.





What will your typical day look like?

This is an exciting time to be part of the Industry Program team. You’ll collaborate with peers and leaders on a series of high-impact internal projects related to Deloitte’s industry strategy. From go-to-market campaigns and strategy development (e.g., how can we bring deeper industry expertise to our clients?), to reporting and analytics (e.g., where should we focus to improve financial performance?), to communities of practice and governance (e.g., how do share best practices across teams?)—no day will be the same. You’ll be constantly learning, making an impact, and connecting with a great team.

About The Team

Our mandate is to enable growth by delivering marketplace strategies to address the biggest challenges our clients face. While the Industry Program team does not work directly with clients, we drive the programs that underpin Deloitte’s ability to serve clients with excellence and distinction. Our industry focus spans a broad scope, from financial services and energy to public sector and technology, and more. As a member of the team, you will be exposed to industry and business leadership and decisions that shape Deloitte’s strategic direction.

Enough about us, let’s talk about you

In this role, the expected qualifications are:


Strong analytical skills: You can break down an ambiguous problem into component parts and plan out a strategic approach to tackle them
Effective communication: You can translate complex concepts into digestible written, verbal, or visual messages (emails, presentations, reports)
Organizational prowess: You thrive in an environment of competing deadlines and concurrent projects—while maintaining a keen attention to detail
Appetite for initiative: You are excited to put up your hand, get involved, and get things done—sometimes with limited supervision and guidance
Team player: You love to collaborate with others to solve problems, share knowledge, and succeed together
Technical skills: You get excited about a well-designed Excel or PowerPoint, and you’re comfortable using them to run an analysis or present a compelling narrative
To be eligible for this role, you must be graduating in December 2025 or later

Our approach is grounded on recognizing people's unique strengths and contributions and rewarding the value that they deliver.

Our Total Rewards Package extends well beyond traditional compensation and benefit programs and is designed to recognize employee contributions, encourage personal wellness, and support firm growth. Along with a competitive base salary and variable pay opportunities, we offer a wide array of initiatives that differentiate us as a people-first organization. Some representative examples include: $4,000 per year for mental health support benefits, a $1,300 flexible benefit spending account, 38+ days off (including 10 firm-wide closures known as ""Deloitte Days""), flexible work arrangements and a hybrid work structure.

Chainlink Labs is the primary contributing developer of Chainlink, the decentralized computing platform powering the verifiable web. Chainlink is the industry-standard platform for providing access to real-world data, offchain computation, and secure cross-chain interoperability across any blockchain. Chainlink Labs helps power verifiable applications for banking, DeFi, global trade, and gaming by collaborating with some of the world’s largest financial institutions, notably Swift, DTCC, and ANZ. Chainlink Labs also works with top Web3 teams, including Aave, Compound, GMX, Maker, and Synthetix. Chainlink Labs was ranked in Newsweek’s 100 Most Loved Workplaces 2023 in both the United States and United Kingdom.

Chainlink Labs is pioneering the world’s first fully sustainable and decentralized oracle network, and the Economics team is searching for a Senior Analyst to play a critical role in building it. This role will sit at the intersection of blockchain technology, financial innovation, and economic systems, and shape the future of decentralized economics.

As a Senior Analyst, you will combine economics, data science, and blockchain expertise to shape incentives, optimize network design, and influence the decision-making of our Economics and Executive Leadership teams. You will design, analyze, and operationalize economic models for production applications. You will collaborate across departments to bring innovative solutions from concept to production, ensuring economic soundness and scalability throughout.

This is a high-impact role, offering visibility and influence as you contribute to the development of the Chainlink network. If you’re a meticulous, creative, and motivated individual ready to solve complex economic problems through data-driven decisions in the rapidly evolving world of Web3, this is the role for you.

Your Impact


You'll serve two primary functions: (1) designing and performing analyses that help the Economics and Executive Leadership teams make informed, data-driven decisions, and (2) building and maintaining systems for the parameterization of production applications.
You'll work on a wide array of blockchain economics projects, analyses, and systems, including:
Designing novel mechanisms and incentive schemes
Building models and simulations to evaluate investment opportunities
Designing and parameterizing trading systems
Optimizing parameters for production applications
Contributing to the design of Economics programs and applications
You'll optimize network incentives and systems by engaging directly with the Economics, Product, Engineering, Research, and Data Science teams to understand network dynamics at the deepest level.
You'll operationalize processes and analytics systems, and coordinate cross-functionally to implement them.
This is both a highly technical and highly social role. You will have high visibility and a large impact on how Chainlink builds the world’s first fully sustainable decentralized oracle network.

Requirements


5+ years experience in a quantitative role, particularly trading or quant research
A deep understanding of financial and crypto markets and incentives
Extensive financial modeling background, including data engineering and model automation
Strong SQL and Python skills are mandatory
Experience solving economic problems through statistical/econometric analyses
Substantial data analysis and/or data science experience
Meticulous attention to detail.


Preferred Qualifications


Strong Economics and/or Finance background through Masters-level academics and/or multiple years of industry experience.
Strong organizational and coordination skills necessary to productionize/operationalize processes and applications.
Preferably smart contract programming experience (Rust, Go, Solidity), but familiarity with smart contract code and dApp architecture at a minimum
Published research with an economics or crypto focus (e.g., papers on MEV or PBS, staking and slashing dynamics, node compensation, tokenomics, etc.)


All roles with Chainlink Labs are global and remote-based. Unless otherwise stated, we ask that you try to overlap some working hours with Eastern Standard Time (EST).

Our Purpose

At Deloitte, we are driven to inspire and help our people, organization, communities, and country to thrive. Our Purpose is to build a better future by accelerating and expanding access to knowledge. Purpose defines who we are and gives us reason to exist as an organization.

By living our Purpose, we will make an impact that matters.





What will your typical day look like?

This is an exciting time to be part of the Industry Program team. You’ll collaborate with peers and leaders on a series of high-impact internal projects related to Deloitte’s industry strategy. From go-to-market campaigns and strategy development (e.g., how can we bring deeper industry expertise to our clients?), to reporting and analytics (e.g., where should we focus to improve financial performance?), to communities of practice and governance (e.g., how do share best practices across teams?)—no day will be the same. You’ll be constantly learning, making an impact, and connecting with a great team.

About The Team

Our mandate is to enable growth by delivering marketplace strategies to address the biggest challenges our clients face. While the Industry Program team does not work directly with clients, we drive the programs that underpin Deloitte’s ability to serve clients with excellence and distinction. Our industry focus spans a broad scope, from financial services and energy to public sector and technology, and more. As a member of the team, you will be exposed to industry and business leadership and decisions that shape Deloitte’s strategic direction.

Enough about us, let’s talk about you

In this role, the expected qualifications are:


Strong analytical skills: You can break down an ambiguous problem into component parts and plan out a strategic approach to tackle them
Effective communication: You can translate complex concepts into digestible written, verbal, or visual messages (emails, presentations, reports)
Organizational prowess: You thrive in an environment of competing deadlines and concurrent projects—while maintaining a keen attention to detail
Appetite for initiative: You are excited to put up your hand, get involved, and get things done—sometimes with limited supervision and guidance
Team player: You love to collaborate with others to solve problems, share knowledge, and succeed together
Technical skills: You get excited about a well-designed Excel or PowerPoint, and you’re comfortable using them to run an analysis or present a compelling narrative
To be eligible for this role, you must be graduating in December 2025 or later


Total Rewards

The salary range for this position is $48,500.00 - $55,000.00, and individuals may be eligible to participate in our bonus program. Deloitte is fair and competitive when it comes to the salaries of our people. We regularly benchmark across a variety of positions, industries, sectors, targets, and levels. Our approach is grounded on recognizing people's unique strengths and contributions and rewarding the value that they deliver.

Our Total Rewards Package extends well beyond traditional compensation and benefit programs and is designed to recognize employee contributions, encourage personal wellness, and support firm growth. Along with a competitive base salary and variable pay opportunities, we offer a wide array of initiatives that differentiate us as a people-first organization. Some representative examples include: $4,000 per year for mental health support benefits, a $1,300 flexible benefit spending account, 38+ days off (including 10 firm-wide closures known as ""Deloitte Days""), flexible work arrangements and a hybrid work structure.

Our promise to our people: Deloitte is where potential comes to life

Be yourself, and more.

We are a group of talented people who want to learn, gain experience, and develop skills. Wherever you are in your career, we want you to advance.

You Shape How We Make Impact.

Some guide teams, some change culture, some build essential expertise. We offer opportunities and experiences that support your continuing growth as a leader.

Have as many careers as you want.

We are uniquely able to offer you new challenges and roles – and prepare you for them. We bring together people with unique experiences and talents, and we are the place to develop a lasting network of friends, peers, and mentors.
