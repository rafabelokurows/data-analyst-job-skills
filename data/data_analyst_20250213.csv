Immunai is an engineering-first platform company aiming to improve therapeutic decision-making throughout the drug discovery and development process. We are mapping the immune system at unprecedented scale and granularity and applying machine learning to this massive clinico-immune database, in order to generate novel insights into disease pathology for our partners - pharma companies and research institutes. We provide a comprehensive, end-to-end solution - from data generation and curation to therapeutics development, that continuously supports and validates the capabilities of our platform.

As drug development is becoming increasingly inefficient, our ultimate goal is to help bring breakthrough medicines to patients as quickly and successfully as possible.

Immunai is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.




About the role:

The Metadata Developers Team, part of the Immunai Software group, focuses on advanced tools and solutions to retrieve, store, handle, and analyze complex descriptive biological data, such as laboratory and clinical metadata, with extensive use of domain ontologies. In close collaboration with Immunai’s biocurators and biology experts, we are continuously advancing our technology and data models to improve the consistency and descriptive power of our vast clinical database, as well as the usability and accessibility of data that feed the company’s most advanced algorithms for therapeutic decision-making and discovery.

As Senior Data Engineer at Immunai, you will master metadata-centric software solutions for biological and clinical knowledge by developing a deep understanding of the bio-curation activity and the related data models and processes. You will translate complex operational and data requirements into modular and efficient tools that aim at seamlessly integrating the various phases of curation. You will also be an interface between data producers and consumers to ensure that maximum value can be extracted from our data assets. While being a major code contributor to new and existing tools, you will also act as a guide and mentor to foster innovation and high-quality coding style across the team. Finally, you will be the liaison with other key figures, such as data architect, data steward, and tech leads from complementary domains, in order to ensure alignment on software development standards, data architecture, and data operational processes.

Location: Zürich, Switzerland. This position requires working in a hybrid model from Immunai offices in Zürich.




What will you do?

Guide and collaborate with other Metadata Dev team members in an agile setting to build and maintain new metadata pipelines and applications, or to enhance existing ones, while promoting consistency and harmonization of different components
Interact with biologists, bioinformaticians, and other cross-functional teams to understand and formalize their data needs and tooling requirements, articulate fit-for-purpose solutions that are also innovative and forward-looking
Take responsibility for the quality and integrity of deliverables - you will overlook the coding practices of the team and make sure that they align with the standards set for the whole Software Development group
Participate and contribute in regular meetings to align on technical and operational decisions with your peers from other teams or other stakeholders
Coordinate and contribute to the documentation, training, and user support efforts




Required qualifications:

Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Software Engineering, Bioinformatics, or a related field
5+ years of experience as a Data Engineer, with a strong track-record in handling complex datasets, mastering elaborated data processes, and translating challenging product requirements into effective software solutions
Excellent programming skills with Python (must have) and preferably with another modern high-level language
Extensive experience with relational databases (PostgreSQL preferred), including query optimization and good general understanding of database architectures
Familiarity with other data storage technologies (e.g. HDFS, NoSQL databases) and data warehousing platforms (ideally, BigQuery)
Knowledge of common data operations and integration concepts (e.g. ETL, ELT), with proven ability to design efficient solutions and implement the best practices
Basic understanding of modern web development technologies and architectures
An analytical mindset with strong problem-solving skills and abstraction power
Excellent English communication skills, both written and spoken

Preferred qualifications:

Solid understanding of web development and architecture, preferably with front-end coding experience on the JS TypeScript + React framework
Previous experience with major cloud environments is a strong advantage (Google Cloud Platform preferred)
Coding experience in large Java EE projects is a strong advantage
Some experience with orchestration tools is desirable (e.g. Apache Airflow, Dagster)
Knowledge of secure coding practices, authentication protocols (OAuth, JWT), and data privacy standards is a plus
Familiarity with biotech or healthcare data is also an advantage

Desired personal traits:

You want to make an impact on humankind
You prioritize “We” over “I”
You enjoy getting things done and striving for excellence
You collaborate effectively with people of diverse backgrounds and cultures
You have a growth mindset
You are candid, authentic, and transparent

Toxicological Data specialist / Data curator




Our client is a pioneer in Drug Discovery and Development and one of the frontrunners in Personalised Healthcare. As the world`s largest R&D spender in the pharmaceutical and diagnostics domain, they work in a vast number of drug discovery & therapeutic areas and are highly recognized internationally.




We are currently looking for a Toxicological Data Curator for a 6-month contract (with possibility for extension) based in Basel, Switzerland.

Home Office: 49%, On-site: 51%




Background:

As a team member in the Prediction Modelling (PM) Chapter of Pharmaceutical Science, you will work in close collaboration with toxicologists as well as other scientists in pRED, having access to state-of-the-art bioinformatics and biostatistics tools and methods and gaining toxicological insights from experts in the field.




Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved beyond simple text completion tools into sophisticated systems capable of data extraction, summarization, enrichment, and knowledge capture. These advancements enable the retrieval of information previously locked within documents, reports, presentations, and meeting records, making it possible to repurpose this data and reverse translate knowledge from the past to inform future insights.




The position in question focuses on transforming historical toxicology documents into structured, high-quality datasets through AI-powered extraction while supporting the application of LLMs for toxicological data understanding and enrichment from historical documents. The extracted data will be used to enhance existing data repositories and serve as a foundation for creating new ones tailored to the specific needs of toxicologists.




While LLMs hold immense potential, they are also prone to generating inaccurate or fabricated information, commonly referred to as ""hallucinations."" To address this, rigorous data curation is essential. Curating and validating subsets of the extracted data will not only improve the quality and reliability of the outputs but also contribute to refining and enhancing the performance of the models themselves.




We are looking for a highly skilled and detail-oriented Toxicological Data Curator with a background in biology or toxicology or drug development or veterinary medicine etc . In this role, you will ensure the accuracy, consistency, and scientific validity of toxicological data captured by large language models (LLMs). You will cross-check data outputs against original sources, evaluate the reliability of AI-derived information, and contribute to the development of high-quality datasets to support drug safety and development efforts.




Main Responsibilities:

Data Validation:

Review toxicological data output generated by LLMs and validate it against original resources (e.g., research articles, regulatory documents, toxicology databases).
Identify and document discrepancies, errors, or ambiguities in AI-derived data.
Build up pipeline/dataset (choose one if needed) for toxicological evaluation tasks

Quality Assurance:

Ensure consistency, completeness, and scientific accuracy of curated toxicological datasets.
Adhere to established quality control protocols and contribute to improving workflows as needed.

Toxicology Expertise:

Apply toxicological knowledge to evaluate data related to preclinical and clinical toxicities, mechanisms of toxicity, safety biomarkers, and risk assessments.
Assess relevance and applicability of curated data to specific drug development scenarios.

Collaboration:

Work closely with computational toxicologists, data scientists, and cross-functional teams to align on curation standards and requirements.
Provide feedback to enhance LLM performance based on identified gaps or inaccuracies in the extracted data.

Documentation and Reporting:

Maintain detailed records of validation processes and outcomes.
Prepare periodic reports summarizing curation progress, data quality metrics, and key findings.




Qualifications and Experience:

Relevant working/residency permit or Swiss/EU-Citizenship required
Preferred Master’s in Biology, Pharmacology, Toxicology, Drug Development, Biotechnology or a related field
Experience with data curation, annotation, or systematic review methodologies is a plus
Basic understanding of machine learning, LLMs, or natural language processing (NLP) tools is desirable but not required.
English fluent (min. C1 Level)
Strong attention to detail and commitment to data accuracy
Excellent critical thinking and problem-solving skills, particularly in evaluating scientific information
Ability to synthesize complex toxicological data and present clear, actionable conclusions
Effective written and verbal communication skills for reporting and collaboration

Immunai is an engineering-first platform company aiming to improve therapeutic decision-making throughout the drug discovery and development process. We are mapping the immune system at unprecedented scale and granularity and applying machine learning to this massive clinico-immune database, in order to generate novel insights into disease pathology for our partners - pharma companies and research institutes. We provide a comprehensive, end-to-end solution - from data generation and curation to therapeutics development, that continuously supports and validates the capabilities of our platform.

As drug development is becoming increasingly inefficient, our ultimate goal is to help bring breakthrough medicines to patients as quickly and successfully as possible.

Immunai is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.




About the role:

The Metadata Developers Team, part of the Immunai Software group, focuses on advanced tools and solutions to retrieve, store, handle, and analyze complex descriptive biological data, such as laboratory and clinical metadata, with extensive use of domain ontologies. In close collaboration with Immunai’s biocurators and biology experts, we are continuously advancing our technology and data models to improve the consistency and descriptive power of our vast clinical database, as well as the usability and accessibility of data that feed the company’s most advanced algorithms for therapeutic decision-making and discovery.

As Senior Data Engineer at Immunai, you will master metadata-centric software solutions for biological and clinical knowledge by developing a deep understanding of the bio-curation activity and the related data models and processes. You will translate complex operational and data requirements into modular and efficient tools that aim at seamlessly integrating the various phases of curation. You will also be an interface between data producers and consumers to ensure that maximum value can be extracted from our data assets. While being a major code contributor to new and existing tools, you will also act as a guide and mentor to foster innovation and high-quality coding style across the team. Finally, you will be the liaison with other key figures, such as data architect, data steward, and tech leads from complementary domains, in order to ensure alignment on software development standards, data architecture, and data operational processes.

Location: Zürich, Switzerland. This position requires working in a hybrid model from Immunai offices in Zürich.




What will you do?

Guide and collaborate with other Metadata Dev team members in an agile setting to build and maintain new metadata pipelines and applications, or to enhance existing ones, while promoting consistency and harmonization of different components
Interact with biologists, bioinformaticians, and other cross-functional teams to understand and formalize their data needs and tooling requirements, articulate fit-for-purpose solutions that are also innovative and forward-looking
Take responsibility for the quality and integrity of deliverables - you will overlook the coding practices of the team and make sure that they align with the standards set for the whole Software Development group
Participate and contribute in regular meetings to align on technical and operational decisions with your peers from other teams or other stakeholders
Coordinate and contribute to the documentation, training, and user support efforts




Required qualifications:

Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Software Engineering, Bioinformatics, or a related field
5+ years of experience as a Data Engineer, with a strong track-record in handling complex datasets, mastering elaborated data processes, and translating challenging product requirements into effective software solutions
Excellent programming skills with Python (must have) and preferably with another modern high-level language
Extensive experience with relational databases (PostgreSQL preferred), including query optimization and good general understanding of database architectures
Familiarity with other data storage technologies (e.g. HDFS, NoSQL databases) and data warehousing platforms (ideally, BigQuery)
Knowledge of common data operations and integration concepts (e.g. ETL, ELT), with proven ability to design efficient solutions and implement the best practices
Basic understanding of modern web development technologies and architectures
An analytical mindset with strong problem-solving skills and abstraction power
Excellent English communication skills, both written and spoken

Preferred qualifications:

Solid understanding of web development and architecture, preferably with front-end coding experience on the JS TypeScript + React framework
Previous experience with major cloud environments is a strong advantage (Google Cloud Platform preferred)
Coding experience in large Java EE projects is a strong advantage
Some experience with orchestration tools is desirable (e.g. Apache Airflow, Dagster)
Knowledge of secure coding practices, authentication protocols (OAuth, JWT), and data privacy standards is a plus
Familiarity with biotech or healthcare data is also an advantage

Desired personal traits:

You want to make an impact on humankind
You prioritize “We” over “I”
You enjoy getting things done and striving for excellence
You collaborate effectively with people of diverse backgrounds and cultures
You have a growth mindset
You are candid, authentic, and transparent
