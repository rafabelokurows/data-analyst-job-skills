Over the last year we’ve been building out the foundation of our Data Warehouse (Microsoft Fabric) and BI Platform (Power BI) and are now looking for a skilled analyst to join our BI & Data Team to build out the reporting on top.




What will you be doing in the role?




You’ll be joining the team as our fifth member and our first Analyst on the Team.

The Team currently consist of 4 engineers building ETL pipelines, the data warehouse and Enterprise Semantic Models in Power BI. With you on the Team, we’ll own the full value chain from extracting facts from transactional systems all the way to a final report for consumption by colleagues in our business functions.

As an Analyst you’ll be fully dedicated to translating the enterprise semantic models into reporting in close collaboration with subject matter experts across business functions. The day-to-day focus will be on working with the SMEs to alleviate business pains through the creation of an actional reporting setup to support decision-making. The majority of your future stakeholders are based in the Group HQ in Hillerød, but some are based in our subsidiaries across Europe and North America.

Ellab’s current reporting landscape is a patchwork of a legacy BI solution and reporting happening in Excel based on manual data extracts. With the introduction of our new BI Platform the ambition is to quickly achieve sufficient reporting parity to decommission the existing solutions. Achieving this will be a group effort between you, the remainder of the team and SME’s especially within Finance, Operations & Consulting.

We see you as the person responsible for implementing the front end of the company’s new reporting landscape




Skills you’ll bring to Ellab




Ellab’ BI Platform of choice is Power BI, and you feel at home consuming preexisting semantic models and translate them into reports and dashboards.

You enjoy close collaboration with business specialists help them create the reports needed to make data-backed decisions. You have most likely been working with it for at least a couple of years.

A large part of the job is helping colleagues transitioning from the existing ad-hoc reporting setup into a centralised, structured setup with high reliability and automation. Experience working with SMEs to extract formalised business needs and harmonise definitions is therefore a big plus.

Ellab operates in a range of different fields spanning from manufacturing to a full-blown consultancy business resulting in a complex reporting landscape. Experience working at global enterprise scale with finance, procurement or resource planning departments is a plus.




What we offer

Competitive salary and benefits package.
Opportunity to work in a dynamic and fast-paced environment.
Opportunity to influence your own tasks/responsibilities and develop your career in a supportive environment, making a real impact on a growing international company.
You will be joining a team highly focused on execution and process improvement while also recognizing the importance of work-life balance. Our team is flexible, allowing for remote work when necessary.




The Ellab team – more than just a job

At Ellab, we take pride in being more than just a workplace. We have a highly active Employee club, lots of social arrangements throughout the year, an annual skiing trip and fitness classes in our gym room.

Culturally, we encourage a positive, welcoming and caring tone. We acknowledge that a feeling of belonging is the foundation of our employee's success – Ellab’s success.




The hiring process

If you think it sounds as exciting as we do, apply to join our team today.

We are conducting interviews continuously and will hire when the right match is found. For any questions about the role, reach out to Virginia Beccaglia on vbe@ellab.com.




We are looking forward to hearing from you!

40% of all food produced in the world is wasted. And that has a huge impact on the health of our planet, with 10% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from food waste.

We’re more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation with a mission to empower everyone to take action against food waste, so alongside our marketplace app, we create educational tools, explore new business solutions - such as our Retail Technologies offering, and influence legislation to help reduce food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 113 million registered users and 240,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 419+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.132.000 tonnes of CO2e!

Your mission

We are seeking a talented and driven Data Analyst to join us in shaping the future of our newly established Demand Analytics team. The successful candidate will play a pivotal role in enhancing our team's capabilities around Marketing analytics while benefiting from a robust support structure designed to foster growth and innovation. We are also ready to consider candidates with more work experience as Senior Data Analyst.

As a Marketplace, Marketing is one of Too Good To Go’s most powerful levers for driving demand. Consequently, a strong foundation in marketing metrics is essential for this role. The models and methodologies you will help develop are largely marketing-focused, emphasizing the importance of experience with causal impact modeling and econometric modeling.

That said, Demand Analytics at Too Good To Go extends beyond Marketing. We are looking for someone who can also contribute to broader analytical initiatives, such as demand forecasting and other data-driven projects.

If you’re passionate about leveraging analytics to make a real-world impact and thrive in a dynamic, collaborative environment, we’d love to hear from you.

Collaborate with marketing teams to optimize campaign strategies and resource allocation based on data-driven insights
Conduct in-depth analyses to identify the drivers of demand and measure marketing impact
Utilize marketing insights to inform and enhance demand forecasting models


Requirements


You have an understanding of Marketing Data and KPIs, or a strong appetite to learn this space.
Having experience in analyzing and interpreting marketing performance metrics would be a clear advantage.
You are a great communicator and storyteller - someone who enjoys helping non-technical audiences see what you see in the numbers!
You have hands-on experience working closely with senior stakeholders, ideally within Marketing, to deliver data-driven insights.
You are skilled in designing, executing, and interpreting A/B tests, as well as applying causal inference and impact modeling techniques.
You have econometric modeling experience; familiarity with marketing mix models (MMM) is a plus.
You are proficient in SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and transformation
You have Python expertise for data pre-processing, or statistical analysis. R would also be considered.
You are passionate about data literacy, continuously striving to improve your own skills and those of your team.


Our values

We raise the bar: We always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: Our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple.
We build a legacy: We’re proud of the change we’re driving.

Then we are looking for you as our new BI specialist to become part of our skilled team of data specialists within the Digital & BI team at our headquarter in Copenhagen.




Novo Holdings is a world-leading life science investor, driven by the purpose of improving people’s health and the sustainability of society and the planet. Since 1999 we have been investing to promote groundbreaking solutions in healthcare and bio-sustainability while generating attractive returns that advance the Novo Nordisk Foundation’s grant-giving activities - supporting scientific, humanitarian, and social causes.




We are building out our Business Intelligence and Digital capabilities to be ‘best-in-class’, both internally and in the support of our portfolio companies. As part of the Digital & BI team, you will play an important role in reaching our goals by developing and implementing end-to-end data solutions in the Power BI. This includes data modelling, DAX, and visualization. You will work in close collaboration with our Data Engineers, BI developers, Data Scientists, and Investment Professionals, across our global organisation. Our team is part of Novo Holdings’ Finance & Operations function led by our CFO, spanning finance, legal, and dedicated teams working with ESG, Strategy and Responsible Tax.




The Job

The team is driving the overall data agenda within Novo Holdings and by that, supporting the organisation in making informed decisions. Your key responsibilities as our new Business Intelligence Specialist are:




Develop, implement, and maintain end-to-end data and reporting solutions in Power BI (our main reporting tool)
Perform financial analysis to generate clear actionable insights e.g., the financial performance of Novo Holdings and the portfolio companies
Produce reports and presentations related to all reporting areas, including support in the preparation of annual and interim financial reporting to the Leadership Team, the Board of Directors, the investment teams, and the Finance & Operations function
Prepare and provide ad hoc analyses, reporting, and data extracts for all of Novo Holdings
We are cloud-native with infrastructure built in in Azure and Databricks, and reporting in the Microsoft Power Platform, primarily Power BI.
We believe in continuous development, and you will get dedicated time for training, courses, workshops, and certificates




Professional Qualifications

You might be newly graduated, with an MSc degree in BI, with student job experience, or employed in your first role with a couple of years of working experience in a business intelligence development setting. You should have working knowledge of Power BI, including data modelling, DAX, and UI design, but we do not expect you to be an expert. It is great if you have a preference towards either the data modelling, or the UX/UI aspects of Power BI development, but should be comfortable in working with both elements.

We have a strong focus on personal development and support upskilling within relevant fields. It is not a prerequisite, but an advantage if you have experience with one or more of the following:




Databricks
Fabric
Azure and DevOps




Personal Qualifications

As a person you are:




Professional, quality-conscious, and impact-oriented
Curious and eager to learn and work with modern technologies and techniques
Able to convey complex information and interact with both business users and technical specialists
Ambitious, proactive, and have a structured approach to problem-solving
Strong interpersonal skills and ability to build good relationships across nationalities and tenures
Independent, take initiative, and communicate effectively and proactively
Capable of working collaboratively within a team, fostering a supportive and inclusive team culture
Able to identify yourself with the Novo Holdings set of values: Performance, Respect, and Responsibility (“The Novo Holdings Way”).




If you do not meet every single requirement, do not worry—no one does. We are excited to hear from you and how you can contribute to our team and impact.




Working at Novo Holdings

Our work environment is driven by purpose and values, and we strive to be recognised by our stakeholders and people as an exceptional enterprise.




We employ more than 180 professionals from various nationalities and backgrounds, all sharing the same goal: To generate attractive long-term returns on the assets of the Novo Nordisk Foundation. Our investment teams are spread across offices in San Fransisco, Boston, London, Singapore, and Shanghai - our headquarters is located just north of Copenhagen in Hellerup.




Contact

We are looking to fill the position as soon as possible and will conduct interviews on an ongoing basis. We encourage you to send your CV and application as soon as possible or no later than the 19th of February 2025




If you have any questions, please contact Senior Business Intelligence Specialist Aske Laustsen at e-mail: ala@novo.dk

We are looking for talent to come and help us!

Do you want to be the ’missing link’ in our Business Finance team with focus on Performance Management, so we grow the business, both organically and through acquisitions?

Performance Management, was created in the beginning of 2024 as part of a newly formed Business Finance function – build to improve business focus, standardization and scalability. Our main purpose is to drive the business dialogue by creating transparency and fuel fact-based decision making for Executive Management, Commercial & Financial leadership and the Board of Directors.

You will work with Performance Management, converting data in to actionable insights

Your focus will be on developing the needed tools and processes, that can facilitate both existing dialogues and generate new ones. Your main tools will be Excel, PowerPoint (& Thinkcell) and PowerBI and your responsibilities can fall within any of the below areas


Develop, build and maintain analytical tools to create and improve transparency on relevant performance metrics for management in Executive leadership and SBUs, that allows for leaders to quickly understand and act on relevant business insights
Drive the monthly reviews as well as Forecast reviews and facilitate the process with relevant tools & packages for CEO and CFO to fuel professional, fact-based and relevant business discussions
Develop high-quality presentations for EMB and BoD to ensure the best possible dialogue and clarity around business-critical discussions and actions
Support Senior leadership with relevant ad-hoc analysis and insights to help understand the business and potential challenges


We are a small team who drive this agenda and we are looking for a Performance Management Analyst who wants to work within the sphere of Performance Management and help DLF navigate to grow the business.

This is you!

We are looking for an engaged, bright and eager graduate who is at the beginning of their career.

Your attitude to contribute to our purpose and your fit with the team and the rest of Business Finance is what we care about the most!

Other than that, If you can check most of the boxes off below we would really like to hear from you!


‘Performance management’, ‘numbers’, ‘Excel’, ‘PowerBI’ and ‘Financial/commercial analysis’ are all key words that you want to work with!
You bring an engaged and friendly attitude to work – and you want to learn and contribute
You have a relevant degree within Economics or equivalent preferably with 1-2 years of relevant experience
You have experience working with financial tools in Excel and/or PowerBI as well as the underlying data models
You are open to a blend of new as well as operational tasks

This is us!

Performance Management is a new and young team and together with Business Finance we are 7 in total, consisting of diverse backgrounds both with long-time experience in DLF as well as new hires. Common to us all, is that we appreciate a fun and relaxed atmosphere though with an unwavering focus on being ambitious about the value we create for the business. As a member of the team we can offer you


An exciting workplace where we will support your growth and develop your skills based on where you are. We are looking for an analyst, but want to hire for a career.
Balance and flexibility. It is equally important for us to be ambitious and deliver what we promise as it is to ensure we have fun on the way and can enjoy our private lives. We all appreciate to be together at the office but equally support the option to work from home when it is needed.
Immediate contribution and exposure – As a small team with an array of different potential tasks you will get immediate responsibility serving key stakeholder groups including the Group CEO and CFO as well as Executive Management, the Board of Directors and other senior leadership. The tools and insight you provide will bring value at a high level and contribute to drive the business dialogue forward.

Driversnote is a product-centric and profitable SaaS company in the heart of Copenhagen. We proudly help over 3 million users across more than 50 countries log their mileage. No one enjoys the hassle of mileage documentation. We automate and simplify this tedious task, and make our customer’s work-life easier while saving them both time and money.




We are 35 people working closely together on design, mobile and web development, marketing, support, sales and customer success.




At Driversnote, you will enjoy the benefits of working at a company that has a clear product-market fit and is fully owned and operated by the founder team. We're profitable and have quadrupled our ARR over the last three years. Our scale will allow you to operate in a truly data-driven fashion, and our independence ensures that we always align our decisions with the best interests of our customers and employees.




The product

Driversnote’s main experience is a highly rated freemium app, to a large extent spread through word of mouth. We offer automatic mileage tracking based on the phone's geo location and in addition, we offer a piece of hardware known as an iBeacon to ensure precision tracking, when you enter your car.




The mobile app is backed by a substantial backend, and at driversnote.com we offer a fully fledged web application with advanced trip management, team management and workflows for teams.




We have a B2C-like relationship with many of our users, but we are gradually moving more and more into traditional B2B space with all that this entails of further product enhancements.




The way we work

We use a product development process known as Shape Up, where a few key people take the role as shapers and define projects that can be designed, implemented and released within 6 weeks, known as cycles. For each 6 week cycle, we form new cross-functional teams with designers, developers, marketeers and customer supporters on them, and we let the teams focus exclusively on finishing their projects within the cycle. Each 6 week cycle is followed by a 2 week cool-down period, where we fix bugs, execute functional projects, evaluate how we did and plan the next cycle.




We like to say that our unfair advantage is that we care more than our competitors, and our users and customers tend to agree when they review our app, respond to NPS surveys and rate our support. We have a generous budget set aside for each employee to learn and develop, and we do a lot of fun stuff together.




The opportunity

We are very data-driven at Driversnote, and with over 3 million users to learn from, that's not just something we say. Data is at the heart of every decision we make, and to us, every change is an experiment and a chance to learn. We use BigQuery as our data warehouse, and use Looker Studio to create reports and dashboards, so it’s possible to dive right into our data.




Last year we hired our first data analyst fully dedicated to understanding our data and making the most of it. Our increased data capabilities have been a great success, and now we are ready to expand the data analysis team with this additional role and bring even more experience into the company.




The role

As our new Principal Data Analyst, you will report to the CTO and work closely with everyone from senior leaders to product, design, and marketing on maturing the ways we work with and learn from data. As part of your daily life, you will




Own our data warehouse and analytics setup with support from our developers.
Pro-actively identify new opportunities for business growth and improving user experience based on our data.
Service our management team with data and insights supporting strategic decisions.
Take ownership of our experiment setup, assessing hypotheses based on millions of data points.
Drive our build-measure-learn loop by sparring on experiment designs and partner with experiment owners to conclude and learn from results
Support the product, operations and marketing team by having a smooth flow of data and ensuring easy-to-use reporting.
Take a hands-on approach and build, update and customise data sources.
Enable and upskill the data capabilities of everyone in the company to ensure that we can continue to be obsessively data-driven as we scale up.




Based on your previous experience, we expect you to be proactive, continuously optimize the way we work with data and identify new ways to use our data both internally and in our product.




You must:

Have 3+ years of experience analyzing user behavior and funnels inside mobile or web apps.
Have advanced experience with BigQuery or a similar SQL-based data platform, ability to write complex queries from scratch from multiple tables, creating the appropriate joins, extracting and manipulating data, formatting fields, creating new measures and metrics, etc.
Have deep knowledge on business intelligence and data warehousing, and a pulse on data science, data engineering and all aspects of the ETL pipeline.
Understand the typical marketing channels and attribution, especially Google Ads.
Have worked with data from Google Analytics, Firebase or similar platforms.
Have experience with Looker Studio or similar reporting tools.
Be an excellent communicator and data-driven storyteller in spoken as well as written English.
Thrive in an ambiguous, fast-paced environment operating at both strategic and tactical levels with a great attention to detail.
Have strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets, and drive business strategy and decision making through partnership across the organization.




We work in English and on-site from our office in Copenhagen with a flexible work from home policy. You will need a Danish work permit for this role.




What we believe in

Vision & mission: We work to eliminate work-life hassles to let people focus on what matters. Today, that means removing the pain and trivial work of handling mileage, while providing peace of mind that nothing is forgotten and all rules are followed.




Product-led: We focus our work on the end-user and optimize for bottom-up adoption. People's use of our product is what leads to our growth. We sell through our product and as self-service. We invest in customer success instead of outbound sales. Our marketing is focused on people with a need, leading them to the product.




Lean & data-driven: We try to get a deep understanding of the problems we’re solving. But we also acknowledge that we often can’t predict the outcome of our work. So we believe in an experiment-based approach to product development with short build-measure-learn cycles. For this reason, we also don’t believe in detailed plans for more than 3 months ahead.




Long-term & compounding: We invest in things with a continuous return and compound. We, e.g., prefer to sell fewer licenses to smaller companies that are a good fit and have a long-term relationship rather than win a €100k deal with a company that will never actually benefit from our solution. We’re self-funded, so we don’t stress about the next funding round and take the time to go into depth with our work.




What we offer

At Driversnote you will be part of an international team composed of talented people that are fun to be around. You will have ample opportunity to influence decisions at all levels, and we hope we can both teach you something and learn something new from you. You’ll get to work with and learn from a team of highly experienced entrepreneurs and tech people. We’ll set aside resources for independent skill development to help you grow and develop your career.




We work in a relaxed environment with new offices near The Meatpacking District. We get a tasty, freshly cooked lunch every day (vegetarian option available), great coffee, cozy Friday drinks, and have great events; from our running club and gaming nights, to our epic Christmas and summer parties.




Since many of us have spouses and kids that we enjoy spending time with, we can honestly say that we offer a healthy work-life balance along with a competitive salary and all the benefits you would expect.

Vil du være med til at omsætte sundhedsdata til konkrete forbedringer for borgere, patienter og sundhedsprofessionelle?

Har du erfaring med registerforskning i det tværsektorielle sundhedsvæsen, og interesserer du dig for implementering af forskningsbaserede kliniske løsninger til gavn for borgere, patienter og sundhedsprofessionelle på tværs af sektorer? Så er du den forsker, vi søger i TVÆRSPOR.

TVÆRSPOR er et regionalt forskningsprojekt, der står på et stærkt fundament af tværsektorielle sundhedsdata, som anvendes i forskellige delprojekter, der alle har til formål at optimere det tværsektorielle sundhedsvæsen, fx ved at nedbringe antallet af uhensigtsmæssige indlæggelser, optimere patientforløb og udvikle digitale løsninger. Vi arbejder både med kunstig intelligens og mere klassiske analysemetoder, og så er vi stærkt optaget af implementering af resultaterne.

Din primære opgave er at drive tværsektoriel forskning med udgangspunkt i registerbaserede analyser samt udbrede og implementere resultaterne. Derudover får du til opgave at understøtte den forskning, der allerede foregår i TVÆRSPOR. Din uddannelsesmæssige baggrund er underordnet, men vi forventer, at du har en ph.d., gerne nogle års erfaring og et indgående kendskab til sundhedsdata og sundhedsvæsenet på tværs af sektorer. Det vigtigste er, at du kommer med en drivkraft og lyst til at gøre en forskel igennem din forskning.

Du kan genkende dig selv i nedenstående


Du har stærke kompetencer indenfor registerforskning
Erfaring med at anvende komplekse datasæt, avancerede analyseværktøjer og udlede værdifulde indsigter fra tværsektorielle sundhedsdata.
Er vant til at stille kvalificerede forskningsspørgsmål til data og brænder for at dykke ned i data og finde potentialerne.
Kendskab til datadrevne metoder til forbedring af sundhedsprocesser og patientforløb er et stort plus.
Du er proaktiv og har en resultatorienteret tilgang
Evne til at arbejde selvstændigt og målrettet med et klart fokus på at skabe resultater, der kan implementeres i praksis.
Har indsigt i sundhedsvæsenets strukturer og udfordringer og drives af at se konkrete resultater i form af forbedrede patientforløb og optimeret ressourceanvendelse i sundhedsvæsenet.
Du har erfaring med funding og lovgivning
Erfaring med at indhente midler fra både offentlige og private fonde.
Forståelse for GDPR og andre relevante lovgivninger inden for håndtering af sundhedsdata.
Du er god til at formidle og samarbejde tværfagligt og tværsektorielt
Evne til at præsentere komplekse forskningsresultater på en måde, som er letforståelig for forskellige målgrupper.
Erfaring med projektarbejde, hvor flere aktører og perspektiver skal spille sammen, fx på tværs af kommunale, regionale og private aktører.

I TVÆRSPOR vil du indgå i et tværfagligt team. Du vil have tæt samarbejde med andre regionale forskere med interesse for det tværsektorielle sundhedsvæsen samt eksterne samarbejdspartnere. Der vil derudover være et tæt samarbejde med øvrige funktioner i regionen, f.eks. de kliniske afdelinger.

Du får høj grad af selvstændighed i arbejdet, fleksibilitet og udviklingsmuligheder samtidig med, at du kommer til at arbejde i et engageret tværfagligt team.

We're a diverse team of storytellers, puzzle enthusiasts and casual mobile game creators. Our story began in 2008 in the heart of beautiful Copenhagen, and since then we have experienced continuous growth, establishing ourselves as one of the largest gaming companies in Denmark. In more recent years, we have been scaling fast, in big part thanks to the success of a little game called Lily’s Garden. Now we’re on a mission to solidify our position as one of the leaders in creating out-of-the-ordinary casual puzzle games.

With more than 300 talented individuals, we are a mix of over 40 nationalities and 43% women. We truly appreciate the richness of different experiences and perspectives that Tactilers bring to the game. This is why we foster a lean organisational culture, in which each individual is encouraged to take responsibility, be open and grow in their own way. We pride ourselves in cultivating a studio environment that stays away from crunch, that fosters your skills no matter what your discipline is, and one that gives you a place to be creative alongside other passionate and invested storytellers.

We are currently growing our Analytics team and are in the search for the Lead Game Analyst.

In this key role, you will be responsible for ensuring that the foundation of our data infrastructure for Lily's Garden game is solid and consistent (from as early on as possible), as well as contributing to a broader vision for our game analytics as a whole.

So if you have prior experience in data analytics, team leadership, along with a big interest in understanding how games work and what makes them successful, then you might just be our missing piece! 🧩

This role is based in our beautiful Copenhagen office, as we truly believe that when talented people work closely together, amazing things happen! We therefore offer full relocation support to those coming from outside of Denmark. Here’s what you'll do on the day-to-day:


You will uncover insights, identify challenges and opportunities and develop strategies for improving our games
Enhance our capabilities in detailed game analytics and operational reporting by shaping our data stack and platform
Managing one of our talented Data teams
You will be collaborating closely with the rest of the game team to establish, measure and track key metrics for success
Communicating key insights and findings to cross-functional teams
Keeping an up-to-date knowledge of project KPIs
Stay on top of the current industry trends and best practices, applying them where appropriate to enhance product insights capabilities


What we’re looking for:


Strong background in leading strategic data projects and mentoring a diverse team of data analysts
You have a proven track record of working in a senior capacity with multiple stakeholders in fast paced environments.
You have a strong background in data analytics and a good understanding of applied statistics (such as sampling, hypothesis testing and ab testing)
Analytical mindset with the ability to interpret data and effectively communicate findings to all audiences to drive informed product decisions.
Strong technical skills, with proficiency in SQL and Python or other scripting languages
Experience with large data sets and data visualization tools (e.g. Tableau, Looker, PowerBI)


You'll make us extra excited if you also have:


Experience with casual mobile games and an understanding of today’s casual mobile games market

We’re more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation with a mission to empower everyone to take action against food waste, so alongside our marketplace app, we create educational tools, explore new business solutions - such as our Retail Technologies offering, and influence legislation to help reduce food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 108 million registered users and 245,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 395+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1066.000 tonnes of CO2e!

You have experience managing multiple projects
You are passionate about data literacy
You have a proactive mindset and work well in a team environment


Our values


We win together: Food waste is a big beast to fight. We believe in a #oneteam.

We build a legacy: We’re proud of the change we’re driving.
We care: We always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.

Så er du måske den Data Analyst, vi søger i Koncernøkonomi og Styring.




Kan du sikre høj kvalitet i dataløsninger?




Som Data Analyst/Senior Data Analyst arbejder du med data tæt på ledelsen og direktionen i ATP. Du skal udvikle, vedligeholde og optimere datastrukturer og skabeloner og sikre høj datakvalitet i forretningskritisk data på tværs af ATP.




Vi leder efter dig, der har indsigt i, hvordan data understøtter forretningsprocesser, og som kan samarbejde med interessenter i både it og forretning for at understøtte datadrevne beslutninger.




Du kommer til at arbejde med at forbedre vores datainfrastruktur og udvikle skabeloner, der sikrer ensartet rapportering. En vigtig del af dine opgaver bliver at gøre data nemt tilgængelige og transparente for organisationen. Samtidig vil du sikre, at vores BI-processer og datastruktur arbejder optimalt sammen og styrker samarbejdet på tværs af afdelinger.




Du får en rolle, hvor du er med til at definere, hvordan vi arbejder med økonomi- og HR-data, og hvordan vi løbende kan udvikle med andre datakilder eller former for oplysninger, som kan berige det grundlag, medarbejdere og ledelsen i ATP foretager beslutninger på baggrund af.




Mere konkret bliver dine opgaver at:




strukturere og dokumentere SAP-data og oprette rapporteringsskabeloner, så vores rapporter bliver ensartede
sikre tilgængeligt og anvendeligt data for vores interne kunder på tværs af it, økonomi og HR
bidrage til en fælles datastruktur, der bliver koblet sammen med de BI-processer, der er og kommer
udbrede brug af data på tværs af Corporate Functions, så vi sikrer sammenhæng i vores økonomiske rapportering.




Brænder du for at skabe indsigt gennem data?




Der er mange veje til stillingen som Data Analyst/Senior Data Analyst, men vi forestiller os, at du har en mellem til lang videregående uddannelse og gerne et par års erhvervserfaring, der er relevant til stillingen. Alternativt er du nyuddannet med en kandidatgrad og kan få en plads i ATP’s graudateprogram.




Vi leder efter dig, der har teknisk indsigt, men også evner at forstå, hvordan datadrevne løsninger kan skabe reel værdi for forretningen.




Derudover tænker vi, at du har:




erfaring med projekt- eller konsulentarbejde
erfaring med BI-relateret arbejde, gerne i en finansfunktion
kendskab til SAP og M365 Microsoft-pakken
evnen til at kommunikere komplekse og tekniske emner til både tekniske og ikke-tekniske interessenter.




Vi stiller høje krav til din faglighed, og du vil blive mødt af en forventning med at tage ansvar, stille spørgsmål og udvikle dig selv og de fællesskaber, du bliver en del af. Vi ved nemlig, at engagerede medarbejdere er altafgørende for, at vi når vores mål og bliver ved med at være de bedste til at løse vigtige samfundsopgaver.




Vil du være en del af et unikt fagligt fællesskab?




I Koncernøkonomi og Styring ser vi frem til at få dig med på holdet i en afdeling, hvor vi samlet set er mere end 70 medarbejdere, der arbejder med alle aspekter inden for data, som bruges i den daglige drift og udvikling af en stor koncern som ATP.




I teamet er vi 6 digitaliserings-, data- og BI-specialister, og du bliver den syvende. Vi har stor berøringsflade på tværs af Corporate Functions, og vi gør os umage med den rapportering, vi laver, fordi den skaber stor værdi for ledelsen og resten af vores kolleger.




Du bliver del af et team, hvor vi er forskellige både fagligt og personligt, men hvor vi er gode til at sparre med og inspirere hinanden fagligt. Det er vigtigt for os, at vi møder hinanden med gensidig respekt og rummelighed, og at vi lykkedes med vores opgaver rettidigt og i en god kvalitet.




I ATP er barren sat højt, både når det gælder ambitioner og trivsel. Vi tror på et arbejdsliv i balance. Det kræver fleksibilitet med plads til den enkelte - og det har vi.




=dig? Så send os dit CV




Du behøver ikke sende os en lang ansøgning. Vi er mere interesserede i dit CV, som du skal sende senest den 16. februar. Når du sender dit CV via vores system, får du mulighed for kort at beskrive din motivation for at søge stillingen.




I ATP arbejder vi for en fair rekrutteringsproces, og derfor beder vi dig om ikke at vedhæfte billede i dit CV eller angive din alder, når du søger.




Vi behandler henvendelser løbende og håber på opstart hurtigst muligt. Du kan læse mere om rekrutteringsforløbet her.




Har du spørgsmål til stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte Louise Løve Langhorm på tlf. 20 49 68 28 eller mail lll@atp.dk.

We’re looking for a Business Intelligence Partner to join our Finance, Legal & Data team—someone who thrives on turning complex data into meaningful insights that drive real impact. If you love building dashboards, solving data challenges, and empowering teams with reliable, actionable information, we’d love to hear from you.




What excites you:

You want to make a difference. You see the bigger picture and know how to connect the dots between data and business strategy. You’re passionate about building dashboards, owning data models, and shaping how a company makes data-driven decisions. Your work will influence teams across Famly, giving them the tools and insights they need to succeed.




What excites us:

You are a technical wizard. Your understanding of data and proficiency in SQL gives us goosebumps, and your excellence at translating data into insights that drive value and impact, is the cherry on top. You work across teams, interacting with various stakeholders to achieve shared goals. You listen well and are a strong communicator, whether it’s a detailed report or an executive summary, you can make complex data accessible and actionable for any audience. You’re not just here to follow instructions—you’re proactive, resourceful, and excited about driving improvements and leading projects, and you take ownership over your tasks, are able to step back to see the full picture, being a source of truth on analyses.




What you’ll be doing:

Building dashboards: Develop and maintain easy-to-use dashboards that provide real insights for leadership, managers, and individual teams. We’re focusing on leadership dashboards in the short term, with plans to expand into personal dashboards and OKR integration later in the year.
Owning Data Integrity: Act as the company’s data steward, ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and consistency of data across all systems. Identify and resolve data inconsistencies to maintain a trusted source of truth
Driving Cross-Functional Collaboration: Partner with teams across departments to understand their data needs and deliver solutions that optimize processes and drive better outcomes. Lead projects that address underlying data challenges, coordinating with stakeholders to implement sustainable fixes.
Delivering Insights: Provide actionable insights and analytics to enable smarter, data-driven decision-making across the organization. Implement feedback loops to refine dashboards and ensure they evolve with the company’s needs.
Promoting Data Literacy: Champion a culture of data-driven decision-making by educating teams and empowering them to integrate data into their strategies.




What you bring to the role:

SQL Mastery: You’re highly skilled in querying and managing data with SQL.
Developer knowledge: You know your way around Github or other modern version control systems
Data Visualization Knowledge: You understand the best practices for creating dashboards that are both intuitive and impactful.
Systems Savvy: You have a high level of systems intuition, quickly grasping complex data landscapes.
Cross-Functional Understanding: You can work effectively with diverse teams to identify needs and deliver insights that matter.
Great communication skills: You can break down complex data concepts for both technical and non-technical audiences.
Bonus Points: If you have experience developing small API integrations or connecting systems, we’ll be even more impressed.




About you:

You’re a proactive results-driven problem solver. You don’t wait for issues to arise—you anticipate them and act.
You’re meticulous, ensuring data accuracy and consistency in every project.
You thrive on teamwork and enjoy building relationships across departments.
You’re curious & adaptable, always learning and are comfortable navigating a fast-paced, dynamic environment.
You are the data champion! You’re passionate about fostering data literacy and empowering others to make informed decisions.
You’re a self-starter and when faced with new tools, you don’t shy away, but roll up your sleeves and learn.

We appreciate that everyone brings something unique, so even if you don’t tick every box above, we’d still love to read your application.




And Famly are...? … you wonder

At Famly, we are committed to giving children the best possible start in life and support them in the essential work that is necessary to achieve this. To this end, we have been developing a holistic digital solution since 2013 that simplifies workflows and makes everyday daycare life easier for educators and parents.

These days, the 170 of us building Famly are trying to do two things for our 6,300 customers:

Giving children the best possible start to life.
Championing the vital work that goes into making that happen.

We do that with software that brings hundreds of thousands of parents closer to their child’s day while they’re away from them. We also make financial, pedagogical, and planning tools for more than 34,000 childcare professionals, saving them hours and reducing their admin stress. Ultimately, that gives them more time and headspace for the little ones that really matter. Come help us make that happen.




You’ll love working here because:

We’re all about hiring clever people who are good humans too. It means Famly is full of top thinkers and generous teammates waiting to help you shine.
We like to give a lot of ownership both in terms of responsibility and freedom to try new things. We’ll get you up and running and collaborate along the way, of course.
A value of ‘make your colleagues shine’ is all about breaking down silos, celebrating one another, and staying connected across departments, offices, and oceans.
Top-notch work equipment (including noise cancelling headphones for those focus periods!).
A big focus on people support with personal and career development, including leadership training in a wide-variety of topics.




Interested? Let us know! We're looking to fill the position as soon as possible, so get your application in today by sending us:

Your CV
A cover letter, in which you tell us about yourself and why you’re the best person for this position.




This is what our interview process looks like:

Video conversation with Senior People Partner
Logical test
On-site interview with the Senior Director of Finance & Legal, which will include completing a skills test




We look forward to hearing from you!







Famly is committed to creating a more diverse, equal, and inclusive workforce, building teams that represent a variety of backgrounds, perspectives and experiences. It is a fundamental policy at Famly not to discriminate on any basis or characteristics and celebrate diversity. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to apply.

Om Kinnerton Capital

Kinnerton er en investeringsvirksomhed, grundlagt i 2010, og som har specialiseret sig dels i kapital/investering og dels i kreditfinansiering til investorer i det nordiske real estate marked.

Deres investeringsstrategi er baseret på dybdegående markedsresearch og analyser.




På grund af den specialiserede karakter af Kinnertons strategier oplever virksomheden begrænset konkurrence, hvilket resulterer i attraktive afkast for investorerne.




Kinnerton opstod efter finanskrisen hvor de overtog en betydelig portefølje af lån, herunder misligholdte lån, fra Finansiel Stabilitet.




Med op til €700 millioner under forvaltning har Kinnerton opbygget en stærk track record inden for tre kerneområder: Development Loans, Junior Mortgages og Non-Performing Loans.

Virksomheden undergår i øjeblikket en kraftig vækst og har indtaget en stærk position på markedet.

Driversnote is a product-centric and profitable SaaS company in the heart of Copenhagen. We proudly help over 3 million users across more than 50 countries log their mileage. No one enjoys the hassle of mileage documentation. We automate and simplify this tedious task, and make our customer’s work-life easier while saving them both time and money.




We are 35 people working closely together on design, mobile and web development, marketing, support, sales and customer success.




At Driversnote, you will enjoy the benefits of working at a company that has a clear product-market fit and is fully owned and operated by the founder team. We're profitable and have quadrupled our ARR over the last three years. Our scale will allow you to operate in a truly data-driven fashion, and our independence ensures that we always align our decisions with the best interests of our customers and employees.




The product

Driversnote’s main experience is a highly rated freemium app, to a large extent spread through word of mouth. We offer automatic mileage tracking based on the phone's geo location and in addition, we offer a piece of hardware known as an iBeacon to ensure precision tracking, when you enter your car.




The mobile app is backed by a substantial backend, and at driversnote.com we offer a fully fledged web application with advanced trip management, team management and workflows for teams.




We have a B2C-like relationship with many of our users, but we are gradually moving more and more into traditional B2B space with all that this entails of further product enhancements.




The way we work

We use a product development process known as Shape Up, where a few key people take the role as shapers and define projects that can be designed, implemented and released within 6 weeks, known as cycles. For each 6 week cycle, we form new cross-functional teams with designers, developers, marketeers and customer supporters on them, and we let the teams focus exclusively on finishing their projects within the cycle. Each 6 week cycle is followed by a 2 week cool-down period, where we fix bugs, execute functional projects, evaluate how we did and plan the next cycle.




We like to say that our unfair advantage is that we care more than our competitors, and our users and customers tend to agree when they review our app, respond to NPS surveys and rate our support. We have a generous budget set aside for each employee to learn and develop, and we do a lot of fun stuff together.




The opportunity

We are very data-driven at Driversnote, and with over 3 million users to learn from, that's not just something we say. Data is at the heart of every decision we make, and to us, every change is an experiment and a chance to learn. We use BigQuery as our data warehouse, and use Looker Studio to create reports and dashboards, so it’s possible to dive right into our data.




Last year we hired our first data analyst fully dedicated to understanding our data and making the most of it. Our increased data capabilities have been a great success, and now we are ready to expand the data analysis team with this additional role and bring even more experience into the company.




The role

As our new Principal Data Analyst, you will report to the CTO and work closely with everyone from senior leaders to product, design, and marketing on maturing the ways we work with and learn from data. As part of your daily life, you will




Own our data warehouse and analytics setup with support from our developers.
Pro-actively identify new opportunities for business growth and improving user experience based on our data.
Service our management team with data and insights supporting strategic decisions.
Take ownership of our experiment setup, assessing hypotheses based on millions of data points.
Drive our build-measure-learn loop by sparring on experiment designs and partner with experiment owners to conclude and learn from results
Support the product, operations and marketing team by having a smooth flow of data and ensuring easy-to-use reporting.
Take a hands-on approach and build, update and customise data sources.
Enable and upskill the data capabilities of everyone in the company to ensure that we can continue to be obsessively data-driven as we scale up.




Based on your previous experience, we expect you to be proactive, continuously optimize the way we work with data and identify new ways to use our data both internally and in our product.




You must:

Have 3+ years of experience analyzing user behavior and funnels inside mobile or web apps.
Have advanced experience with BigQuery or a similar SQL-based data platform, ability to write complex queries from scratch from multiple tables, creating the appropriate joins, extracting and manipulating data, formatting fields, creating new measures and metrics, etc.
Have deep knowledge on business intelligence and data warehousing, and a pulse on data science, data engineering and all aspects of the ETL pipeline.
Understand the typical marketing channels and attribution, especially Google Ads.
Have worked with data from Google Analytics, Firebase or similar platforms.
Have experience with Looker Studio or similar reporting tools.
Be an excellent communicator and data-driven storyteller in spoken as well as written English.
Thrive in an ambiguous, fast-paced environment operating at both strategic and tactical levels with a great attention to detail.
Have strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets, and drive business strategy and decision making through partnership across the organization.




We work in English and on-site from our office in Copenhagen with a flexible work from home policy. You will need a Danish work permit for this role.




What we believe in

Vision & mission: We work to eliminate work-life hassles to let people focus on what matters. Today, that means removing the pain and trivial work of handling mileage, while providing peace of mind that nothing is forgotten and all rules are followed.




Product-led: We focus our work on the end-user and optimize for bottom-up adoption. People's use of our product is what leads to our growth. We sell through our product and as self-service. We invest in customer success instead of outbound sales. Our marketing is focused on people with a need, leading them to the product.




Lean & data-driven: We try to get a deep understanding of the problems we’re solving. But we also acknowledge that we often can’t predict the outcome of our work. So we believe in an experiment-based approach to product development with short build-measure-learn cycles. For this reason, we also don’t believe in detailed plans for more than 3 months ahead.




Long-term & compounding: We invest in things with a continuous return and compound. We, e.g., prefer to sell fewer licenses to smaller companies that are a good fit and have a long-term relationship rather than win a €100k deal with a company that will never actually benefit from our solution. We’re self-funded, so we don’t stress about the next funding round and take the time to go into depth with our work.




What we offer

At Driversnote you will be part of an international team composed of talented people that are fun to be around. You will have ample opportunity to influence decisions at all levels, and we hope we can both teach you something and learn something new from you. You’ll get to work with and learn from a team of highly experienced entrepreneurs and tech people. We’ll set aside resources for independent skill development to help you grow and develop your career.




We work in a relaxed environment with new offices near The Meatpacking District. We get a tasty, freshly cooked lunch every day (vegetarian option available), great coffee, cozy Friday drinks, and have great events; from our running club and gaming nights, to our epic Christmas and summer parties.




Since many of us have spouses and kids that we enjoy spending time with, we can honestly say that we offer a healthy work-life balance along with a competitive salary and all the benefits you would expect.

Vil du være med til at omsætte sundhedsdata til konkrete forbedringer for borgere, patienter og sundhedsprofessionelle?

Har du erfaring med registerforskning i det tværsektorielle sundhedsvæsen, og interesserer du dig for implementering af forskningsbaserede kliniske løsninger til gavn for borgere, patienter og sundhedsprofessionelle på tværs af sektorer? Så er du den forsker, vi søger i TVÆRSPOR.

TVÆRSPOR er et regionalt forskningsprojekt, der står på et stærkt fundament af tværsektorielle sundhedsdata, som anvendes i forskellige delprojekter, der alle har til formål at optimere det tværsektorielle sundhedsvæsen, fx ved at nedbringe antallet af uhensigtsmæssige indlæggelser, optimere patientforløb og udvikle digitale løsninger. Vi arbejder både med kunstig intelligens og mere klassiske analysemetoder, og så er vi stærkt optaget af implementering af resultaterne.

Din primære opgave er at drive tværsektoriel forskning med udgangspunkt i registerbaserede analyser samt udbrede og implementere resultaterne. Derudover får du til opgave at understøtte den forskning, der allerede foregår i TVÆRSPOR. Din uddannelsesmæssige baggrund er underordnet, men vi forventer, at du har en ph.d., gerne nogle års erfaring og et indgående kendskab til sundhedsdata og sundhedsvæsenet på tværs af sektorer. Det vigtigste er, at du kommer med en drivkraft og lyst til at gøre en forskel igennem din forskning.

Du kan genkende dig selv i nedenstående


Du har stærke kompetencer indenfor registerforskning
Erfaring med at anvende komplekse datasæt, avancerede analyseværktøjer og udlede værdifulde indsigter fra tværsektorielle sundhedsdata.
Er vant til at stille kvalificerede forskningsspørgsmål til data og brænder for at dykke ned i data og finde potentialerne.
Kendskab til datadrevne metoder til forbedring af sundhedsprocesser og patientforløb er et stort plus.
Du er proaktiv og har en resultatorienteret tilgang
Evne til at arbejde selvstændigt og målrettet med et klart fokus på at skabe resultater, der kan implementeres i praksis.
Har indsigt i sundhedsvæsenets strukturer og udfordringer og drives af at se konkrete resultater i form af forbedrede patientforløb og optimeret ressourceanvendelse i sundhedsvæsenet.
Du har erfaring med funding og lovgivning
Erfaring med at indhente midler fra både offentlige og private fonde.
Forståelse for GDPR og andre relevante lovgivninger inden for håndtering af sundhedsdata.
Du er god til at formidle og samarbejde tværfagligt og tværsektorielt
Evne til at præsentere komplekse forskningsresultater på en måde, som er letforståelig for forskellige målgrupper.
Erfaring med projektarbejde, hvor flere aktører og perspektiver skal spille sammen, fx på tværs af kommunale, regionale og private aktører.

I TVÆRSPOR vil du indgå i et tværfagligt team. Du vil have tæt samarbejde med andre regionale forskere med interesse for det tværsektorielle sundhedsvæsen samt eksterne samarbejdspartnere. Der vil derudover være et tæt samarbejde med øvrige funktioner i regionen, f.eks. de kliniske afdelinger.

Du får høj grad af selvstændighed i arbejdet, fleksibilitet og udviklingsmuligheder samtidig med, at du kommer til at arbejde i et engageret tværfagligt team. Vores omgangsform er åben og positiv, og baseret på tillid til hinandens faglighed og opgaveløsning. Vi sparrer med hinanden og byder ind på hinandens opgaver, men er afhængige af, at vi hver især tager ansvar for at følge vores opgaver til dørs. TVÆRSPORs regionale udgangspunkt betyder, at du kommer til at arbejde tæt sammen med andre centrale aktører på forsknings- og innovationsområdet.

Dit organisatoriske ophæng og din arbejdsplads vil være Forskningsenheden på Regionshospitalet Horsens. I det omfang arbejdet tillader det, vil der være mulighed for hjemmearbejdsdage, ligesom der skal påregnes ekstern mødeaktivitet.

We're a diverse team of storytellers, puzzle enthusiasts and casual mobile game creators. Our story began in 2008 in the heart of beautiful Copenhagen, and since then we have experienced continuous growth, establishing ourselves as one of the largest gaming companies in Denmark. In more recent years, we have been scaling fast, in big part thanks to the success of a little game called Lily’s Garden. Now we’re on a mission to solidify our position as one of the leaders in creating out-of-the-ordinary casual puzzle games.

With more than 300 talented individuals, we are a mix of over 40 nationalities and 43% women. We truly appreciate the richness of different experiences and perspectives that Tactilers bring to the game. This is why we foster a lean organisational culture, in which each individual is encouraged to take responsibility, be open and grow in their own way. We pride ourselves in cultivating a studio environment that stays away from crunch, that fosters your skills no matter what your discipline is, and one that gives you a place to be creative alongside other passionate and invested storytellers.

🚀 Your Role & Impact

We are currently growing our Analytics team and are in the search for the Lead Game Analyst.

In this key role, you will be responsible for ensuring that the foundation of our data infrastructure for Lily's Garden game is solid and consistent (from as early on as possible), as well as contributing to a broader vision for our game analytics as a whole. You'll lead a team of game analysts, shape the vision for analytics, provide data-driven insights to senior leadership, and drive initiatives to improve processes and solutions across the company.

So if you have prior experience in data analytics, team leadership, along with a big interest in understanding how games work and what makes them successful, then you might just be our missing piece! 🧩

This role is based in our beautiful Copenhagen office, as we truly believe that when talented people work closely together, amazing things happen! We therefore offer full relocation support to those coming from outside of Denmark. Here’s what you'll do on the day-to-day:


You will uncover insights, identify challenges and opportunities and develop strategies for improving our games
Enhance our capabilities in detailed game analytics and operational reporting by shaping our data stack and platform
Managing one of our talented Data teams
You will be collaborating closely with the rest of the game team to establish, measure and track key metrics for success
Communicating key insights and findings to cross-functional teams
Keeping an up-to-date knowledge of project KPIs
Stay on top of the current industry trends and best practices, applying them where appropriate to enhance product insights capabilities


What we’re looking for:


Strong background in leading strategic data projects and mentoring a diverse team of data analysts
You have a proven track record of working in a senior capacity with multiple stakeholders in fast paced environments.
You have a strong background in data analytics and a good understanding of applied statistics (such as sampling, hypothesis testing and ab testing)
Analytical mindset with the ability to interpret data and effectively communicate findings to all audiences to drive informed product decisions.
Strong technical skills, with proficiency in SQL and Python or other scripting languages
Experience with large data sets and data visualization tools (e.g. Tableau, Looker, PowerBI)


You'll make us extra excited if you also have:


Experience with casual mobile games and an understanding of today’s casual mobile games market


What’s in it for you?

DLF is a global leader within forage and turf seeds, situated in Denmark, Roskilde (soon in a new Headquarter in Smørum) with roughly 2,000 employees across more than 20 countries, serving customers in 100 countries. We are on an exciting journey as our Executive Management has set ambitious targets for the global company over the next 3 years under our newly formed Group Strategy “Connecting to Grow”.

 

We are looking for talent to come and help us!

Do you want to be the ’missing link’ in our Business Finance team with focus on Performance Management, so we grow the business, both organically and through acquisitions?

Performance Management, was created in the beginning of 2024 as part of a newly formed Business Finance function – build to improve business focus, standardization and scalability. Our main purpose is to drive the business dialogue by creating transparency and fuel fact-based decision making for Executive Management, Commercial & Financial leadership and the Board of Directors.

 

You will work with Performance Management, converting data in to actionable insights

Your focus will be on developing the needed tools and processes, that can facilitate both existing dialogues and generate new ones. Your main tools will be Excel, PowerPoint (& Thinkcell) and PowerBI and your responsibilities can fall within any of the below areas

Develop, build and maintain analytical tools to create and improve transparency on relevant performance metrics for management in Executive leadership and SBUs, that allows for leaders to quickly understand and act on relevant business insights
Drive the monthly reviews as well as Forecast reviews and facilitate the process with relevant tools & packages for CEO and CFO to fuel professional, fact-based and relevant business discussions
Develop high-quality presentations for EMB and BoD to ensure the best possible dialogue and clarity around business-critical discussions and actions
Support Senior leadership with relevant ad-hoc analysis and insights to help understand the business and potential challenges




We are a small team who drive this agenda and we are looking for a Performance Management Analyst who wants to work within the sphere of Performance Management and help DLF navigate to grow the business.

 

This is you!

We are looking for an engaged, bright and eager graduate who is at the beginning of their career. You see the DLF journey as an exciting career opportunity and want to improve your skills within the field of performance management. Your attitude to contribute to our purpose and your fit with the team and the rest of Business Finance is what we care about the most!

Other than that, If you can check most of the boxes off below we would really like to hear from you!

‘Performance management’, ‘numbers’, ‘Excel’, ‘PowerBI’ and ‘Financial/commercial analysis’ are all key words that you want to work with!
You bring an engaged and friendly attitude to work – and you want to learn and contribute
You have a relevant degree within Economics or equivalent preferably with 1-2 years of relevant experience
You have experience working with financial tools in Excel and/or PowerBI as well as the underlying data models
You are open to a blend of new as well as operational tasks
You think DLF sounds like a great place to work, and can see yourself here long-term

You speak English fluently (Corporate Finance includes nationalities from around the world and Danish is not a prerequisite)

 

This is us!

Performance Management is a new and young team and together with Business Finance we are 7 in total, consisting of diverse backgrounds both with long-time experience in DLF as well as new hires. Common to us all, is that we appreciate a fun and relaxed atmosphere though with an unwavering focus on being ambitious about the value we create for the business. As a member of the team we can offer you:




An exciting workplace where we will support your growth and develop your skills based on where you are. We are looking for an analyst, but want to hire for a career.
Balance and flexibility. It is equally important for us to be ambitious and deliver what we promise as it is to ensure we have fun on the way and can enjoy our private lives. We all appreciate to be together at the office but equally support the option to work from home when it is needed.
Immediate contribution and exposure – As a small team with an array of different potential tasks you will get immediate responsibility serving key stakeholder groups including the Group CEO and CFO as well as Executive Management, the Board of Directors and other senior leadership. The tools and insight you provide will bring value at a high level and contribute to drive the business dialogue forward.
A brand-new Headquarter in Smørum is currently under construction and will be ready in late 2025 where we will move in to state-of-the-art facilities. 




Are you intrigued? Are you ready to take your career to the next level?

Then upload us a motivated CV, and tell us why you’re the right candidate for the role. We aim to conduct the first interviews during week 9-10 so do not hesitate to make your submission. We look forward to hear from you and welcoming you to DLF and our team!
