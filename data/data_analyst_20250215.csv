Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

What You’ll Do


Collaborate with SS&O team members and sales leaders to define key business metrics and gather requirements for which insights should be made available at scale. Architect data pipelines, design and build new Tableau dashboards for stakeholders to use to address their needs. Maintain and improve existing sales data infrastructure and Tableau dashboards based on evolving business requirements.

Work with cross-functional teams including Sales, Strategic Finance, and Business Intelligence to identify data needs and gaps, and align on solutions.
Lead projects end to end, see around corners and provide thought partnership to your team.



What We’re Looking For


3+ years of professional experience in highly analytical environments such as management consulting, investment banking, corporate strategy or technology/media companies.
Understanding of sales and digital advertising platforms and working knowledge of sales systems and tools (Salesforce).
Strong data analytics and business intelligence skills - querying large data sets with advanced SQL, building visualizations with Tableau. Experience building and maintaining data pipelines (authoring, scheduling, monitoring workflows).
Ability to visualize complex data sets that provide insights and clearly inform areas of action.
Passion for building new solutions and enabling analysis at scale to drive decision-making.
Experience in a complex, fast-paced environment.
Organized, detail-oriented and strategically focused.

Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement


We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.
This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 1-2 times/month and therefore needs to be in a commutable distance from the NY office.



At Pinterest we believe the workplace should be equitable, inclusive, and inspiring for every employee. In an effort to provide greater transparency, we are sharing the base salary range for this position. The position is also eligible for equity.

Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It’s where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most.

You’ll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Creating a life you love also means finding a career that celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences that you bring. As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

The Sales Strategy & Operations (SS&O) team partners with advertising sales leaders across sales strategy and analytics, operations and process and tools. Team members are experts in business strategy and operations and analytical and strategic thinking. They are pragmatic and results-oriented. As a Business Intelligence Analyst, you will focus on empowering sales leadership and the broader sales organization with self-serve access to data and insights. You’ll be responsible for designing, building and maintaining scaled sales analytics solutions (dashboards, data tables) for over one thousand internal users.

What You’ll Do


Collaborate with SS&O team members and sales leaders to define key business metrics and gather requirements for which insights should be made available at scale. Architect data pipelines, design and build new Tableau dashboards for stakeholders to use to address their needs. Maintain and improve existing sales data infrastructure and Tableau dashboards based on evolving business requirements.
Democratize sales data by enabling self-serve access to key business drivers, trends and operating metrics. Design fully automated dashboards that are easy to understand, enable self-serve access for the sales org, and can be used by a broad audience with a variety of use cases.
Publish and maintain clear documentation to inform and educate users at scale, gather feedback to identify opportunities for improvement.
Identify ways to streamline and improve the efficiency of our data. Implement changes to our infrastructure (optimize SQL queries and data workflows) to improve the landing time of our data.
Work with cross-functional teams including Sales, Strategic Finance, and Business Intelligence to identify data needs and gaps, and align on solutions.
Lead projects end to end, see around corners and provide thought partnership to your team.



What We’re Looking For


3+ years of professional experience in highly analytical environments such as management consulting, investment banking, corporate strategy or technology/media companies.
Understanding of sales and digital advertising platforms and working knowledge of sales systems and tools (Salesforce).
Strong data analytics and business intelligence skills - querying large data sets with advanced SQL, building visualizations with Tableau. Experience building and maintaining data pipelines (authoring, scheduling, monitoring workflows).
Ability to visualize complex data sets that provide insights and clearly inform areas of action.
Passion for building new solutions and enabling analysis at scale to drive decision-making.
Experience in a complex, fast-paced environment.
Organized, detail-oriented and strategically focused.
Strong written and verbal communication skills.
Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as business administration, or equivalent experience.



Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement


We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.
This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 1-2 times/month and therefore needs to be in a commutable distance from the NY office.



At Pinterest we believe the workplace should be equitable, inclusive, and inspiring for every employee. In an effort to provide greater transparency, we are sharing the base salary range for this position. The position is also eligible for equity.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

KFC Corporation, based in Louisville, Kentucky, is one of the few brands in America that can boast about having a rich, 60-year history of success and innovation. In fact, KFC is the world's most popular chicken restaurant chain and a division of Yum! Brands, the world’s largest restaurant company.

Yum! Brands, Inc., based in Louisville, Kentucky, has over 45,000 restaurants in more than 135 countries and territories and is one of the Aon Hewitt Top Companies for Leaders in North America. In 2018, Yum! Brands was recognized as part of the inaugural Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. The company’s restaurant brands – KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell – are global leaders of the chicken, pizza and Mexican-style food categories.

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have an absolute love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem, and living inside a spreadsheet/data set to find the answer to any question.
Because you love data, you have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis. Experience with Marketing APIs, Big Query or other Cloud Data Warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.), ETL Tools (Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics) and/or Python are all pluses.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and have spent a minimum of 1 year working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.




What You’ll Do:

Reporting: With your expertise in Advanced Excel, SQL, Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools, you’ll be maintaining customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence, generating pivot tables and other visualizations that summarize thousands of lines of data. You should have experience in translating performance media metrics into coherent, digestible reports for client ad campaigns and be comfortable communicating via Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.
Strategy: You’ll be responsible for learning our clients’ businesses and aligning their media strategy with business goals as well as understanding advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to help guide media buying strategy. With a background in paid media and/or digital advertising, you understand concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue and are able to be engaged in discussions with clients to gain trust and shareholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.
