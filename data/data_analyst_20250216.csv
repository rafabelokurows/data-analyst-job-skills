🤸‍♂️You are interested in Product Led Growth and want to play a pivotal role in shaping data-driven strategies and providing insights that directly impact the company's growth in a fast-paced environment.

🌟 Work in Tech with an established product and have autonomy in your role.

💚 Become a Vabler and join a great team, fostering a culture of collaboration.

🎢 Join a company looking to scale and who understands people are their greatest asset.

🌍 Be part of a fully remote and globally distributed team.

About you: 👀

As a Data Analyst, your role is pivotal in driving data-driven decisions within Vable and ensuring our success with the data provided. In addition to our essential criteria we will be looking for the following mindset:


You're passionate about using data to solve complex problems and drive impactful change
You're self-motivated, work independently and take pride in delivering high-quality, impactful analysis
You proactively identify patterns, risks, and opportunities to build scalable, data-driven solutions
You're curious about how things work and how you can improve them
You're a collaborator who can build relationships across multiple teams, in an honest and meaningful way
You're structured and like organisation
You've an excellent work ethic and can manage workloads well
You are able to work effectively within a remote team, it can have its challenges



To be successful in this role, your values matter just as much as skills. Does this sound like you? ✨

🟢We are Kind and Empathetic = Our behaviour and words assume the best in people

🟢We are Always A Team = We are bound together by accountability

🟢We are Curious = A bunch from various backgrounds. We ask questions, plan things out, push the boundaries, challenge the status quo and welcome creativity

🟢We Take Ownership & Deliver = We are focused on our goals and love the details

✅Why work for Vable?


You want ownership of the Data Analytics within Vable
We have a culture that we protect, we value the contributions each Vabler makes
We encourage constant learning so you can keep up to date. A yearly budget of £250 is made available to each Vable employee for continuous learning and development
We encourage creativity and like new ideas and concentrate on the Cultural Add, not fit
We provide comprehensive healthcare cover following probation
You receive a MacBook, monitor and other required technical equipment when you join
33 days of paid leave a year inclusive of statutory holidays, based on where you live
Access to an Employee Assistance Programme through Oliva
We like our virtual socials and really do like to get to know everyone in the team
We are well established; we have been around for 20 years


❌Why it may not be for you:


We are a 40 hour week, Mon-Fri and have core hours, unless stated otherwise or agreed. Being a small remote team, it's how we operate
We have set norms and behaviours and each Vabler is expected to live up to these
While your primary focus will be on data analytics, you'll collaborate with various departments, addressing diverse needs and functions while adapting to shifting priorities. If you prefer a narrowly defined role, this may not be the right fit
We have various meetings per week and people are expected to attend and contribute
Our roles are quite generalist and you will be expected to do areas that you perhaps don't like or feel is not your job. No Vabler has this attitude and we get stuck in and pull our sleeves up. If this isn't you, best not apply.
Everyone has the opportunity to query, ask questions, have new ideas and we will give you our opinion. We operate on continuous feedback and recognition. This isn't for everyone and if this makes you uncomfortable or it's not your thing, this may not be the right fit
We are very transparent and all work is stored on shared drives. Colleagues will give input and it's expected that you will actively adhere to this approach



Interview Process 💌


Intro Call: You will meet a member of the People team for an initial discussion about your background, motivations and experience
Interview: If after the intro call, we're excited to proceed, you will be invited to a second stage interview with the Head of Product & Technology and another applicable manager. This stage will involve a task
Final Interview: Will be with the Head of Product & Technology


🎥 We record all of our interviews, with your permission. It makes it easier as we are globally distributed.

Vable is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment regardless of race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin or disability status.

Our small Canadian-born business was founded in 1978 and has become a global organization that now spans 120 locations across 20 countries. Our expansion has been rapid, but what matters most is the common belief that drives all 5,000 of our people to be a different type of real estate organization. We believe that the places in which we live, work and play have the power to make us happier and healthier, and we are united by a shared sense of purpose, to have a positive impact on people’s lives. In short, we are a global commercial real estate advisory firm with a simple aim for real estate to play a leading role in creating vibrant buildings, cities and places that deliver long-lasting social value and economic impact.

Why Work for Us

We believe that our industry is changing, and we want our business to be a melting pot of curious minds, passionate hearts and strategic intelligence.

Collaboration is embedded in the way we work - our people have the autonomy to collaborate on client relationships, engage teams across the business, lead operations, work collectively on projects, participate in strategy and are ultimately responsible for our growth. Our distinctive Principal-led, privately-owned model puts us in the enviable position of being able to offer every employee the opportunity to own a share of our business and inspires and allows anyone to become a Principal.

The electricity grid is changing beyond recognition, and without deploying new software to orchestrate it, we'll be unable to decarbonise.

At Axle, we're building the infrastructure that'll underpin the decarbonised energy system. Our software crushes CO2 and energy costs. Our goal is insanely ambitious, and we're building a team to match the scale of this challenge. We've just raised a Seed round from world-leading investors including Accel (TechCrunch) and we're growing fast.

We make the technology to move energy usage to times when electricity is cheap and green. Our software controls vehicle charging, heating systems, and home batteries. We use machine learning to figure out what energy people will need, and when they'll need it. We control tens of thousands of energy assets, and we're growing quickly.

Axle is a unique startup. We're building in a legacy industry and moving gigawatt-hours of electrons in the real world, but we operate at lightning speed. We ship extraordinarily quickly, and we're experts in electricity systems. We're backed by some of the best investors in the world, and we're growing the team to meet customer demand.

Requirements

Read more about what we're building here.

At Axle, we read data from hundreds of thousands of devices every day. We then optimize the performance of those devices, and participate in electricity markets with them. As our business grows, we're looking for a driven data analyst to help build reporting, monitoring, and visualization across the business.

Some things you might work on:


Visualizing the charging patterns of thousands of electric vehicles
Building dashboards to help us understand which devices are online
Tracking our financial performance vs our revenue targets



You'll need:


Tech chops: you'll need comfort with SQL and basic Python knowledge to work with and automate our data processes
Strong analytical skills: you'll be speaking MW, kWh, and £ every day
Commercial instincts: we're looking for somebody who can help us spot opportunities lurking in our data!
A deep-seated motivation to combat climate change
Comfort moving fast in an uncertain and changeable environment



You can expect:


insane amounts of ownership
lots of fascinating data to get to grips with
the support of a world class engineering & commercial team


This role would suit an ambitious generalist with a strong analytical background. We don't care if you've held a role with a similar title before: if you've got a track record of getting things done in complex, data-heavy environments, let's chat.

Interview process


Initial interview
Take-home exercise
Final interview (in-person)
Offer, references, and welcome to the team!



Benefits

We love the idea of fully remote work but it doesn't... work. For very early stage companies, people learn faster, get on better, and accomplish more when they're spending a decent chunk of time together. We ask that you spend 2-3 days a week in our London office.

We are extremely keen to build a diverse company, and we're particularly eager to hear from candidates who don't fit the traditional role stereotypes. If you're motivated by our mission, please do reach out, even if you feel you might not ‘check all the boxes'.

Your title will be Data Analyst
This role pays £50k-£80k/year + equity
Matt, Cofounder and CTO, is the hiring manager
We work Mon-Thu in our office in Chancery Lane, London


What are we building? An AI Executive Assistant

In 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that we'd only be working 15 hours a week by 2030. Despite automation in agriculture and industry, that hasn't happened.

Why? The service sector. Walk around the average office and you'll see people's days taken up by emails, Slack and meetings instead of real work.

People in client facing roles - sales, professional services firms, recruiters - feel this most acutely. Instead of advising clients, they spend hours on admin. Following up. Scheduling meetings and taking notes on them. Answering repetitive questions over email.

We've built an AI executive assistant that looks at your emails, messages and meetings, and uses that knowledge to answer your email, schedule meetings, take next steps from meetings and organise your inbox.

Unlike other startups, we're a pure-play applied AI company, not a SaaS company with AI features hastily bolted on! We make use of the best techniques (fine tuned open source models, tool use, and retrieval augmented generation) and as a result, users send 53% of the email drafts we generate.

How has it been going?

Since launching in March 2024, we've gone from $0 to $2.5m in revenue across 3000 paid users. We did this with a team of 4, and without using any paid marketing until November.

We spent Q4 2024 in San Francisco at HF0, the best AI startup accelerator in the world, learning from experts like the CEO of Instacart, Head of Applied Research at OpenAI and the cofounder of Snowflake.

What do we value?

We're very intentional about adding new people. We think a small team of exceptional people working hard at a problem they care about will always beat a larger, more unfocused team. That means you'll need to bring an intensity to this role that might not be asked at other companies. But it also means you will be fast tracked into more senior roles and responsibilities far earlier.

We also believe in hiring people who want ownership and autonomy in their work, and giving it to them. Instead of just being handed tickets, you'll be proactively suggesting metrics that should be monitored and one off analyses that should be done, and proposing improvements to our analytics infrastructure.

What will I do?


Running analyses in SQL to make decisions on product, marketing spend, and pricing strategy, and communicating your findings, method, and recommendations in a clear way to both technical and non-technical audiences
Working with stakeholders in the marketing, sales, customer success and product departments to agree metrics that need to be monitored on an ongoing basis, then building visualisations
Working with data engineers to ensure data is modelled in the correct format to support data visualisation and more detailed analyses


What does our ideal hire look like?

You've worked at an early stage tech company (<100 people) as a data analyst or similar
You have an expert level understanding of both SQL and a data visualization tool (we use Metabase). If you don't know SQL to a very high standard, you shouldn't apply
You are excellent at communicating your analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences: the results, your recommendations, and the method you used
You can proactively structure an analysis given only a business problem
Urgency and intensity in your work


Our tech stack

Broadly, we use a fairly typical ELT stack. It's not a requirement to have worked with every tool we use, but the more the better!


BigQuery as our data warehouse
Metabase for data visualization
Fivetran to pipe raw data from third party tools (eg Stripe, which we use for billing) into our data warehouse
dbt hosted on Github Actions for transformation of raw data into production tables ready for consumption
Census for reverse ETL


The application process


Submit your CV (no need for a cover letter)
An initial call with someone from the Fyxer AI team to review your experience and motivation for joining (15 mins)
Live coding exercise - SQL (30 minutes)
Analytical case study (45 minutes)
Meet Richard - CEO (30 minutes)

          <strong>The basics<br><br></strong><ul><li>Your title will be Data Analyst</li><li>This role pays £50k-£80k/year + equity</li><li>Matt, Cofounder and CTO, is the hiring manager</li><li>We work Mon-Thu in our office in Chancery Lane, London<br><br></li></ul><strong>What are we building? An AI Executive Assistant<br><br></strong>In 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that we'd only be working 15 hours a week by 2030. Despite automation in agriculture and industry, that hasn't happened.<br><br>Why? The service sector. Walk around the average office and you'll see people's days taken up by emails, Slack and meetings instead of real work.<br><br>People in client facing roles - sales, professional services firms, recruiters - feel this most acutely. Instead of advising clients, they spend hours on admin. Following up. Scheduling meetings and taking notes on them. Answering repetitive questions over email.<br><br>We've built an AI executive assistant that looks at your emails, messages and meetings, and uses that knowledge to answer your email, schedule meetings, take next steps from meetings and organise your inbox.<br><br>Unlike other startups, we're a pure-play applied AI company, not a SaaS company with AI features hastily bolted on! We make use of the best techniques (fine tuned open source models, tool use, and retrieval augmented generation) and as a result, users send 53% of the email drafts we generate.<br><br><strong>How has it been going?<br><br></strong>Since launching in March 2024, we've gone from $0 to $2.5m in revenue across 3000 paid users. We did this with a team of 4, and without using any paid marketing until November.<br><br>We spent Q4 2024 in San Francisco at HF0, the best AI startup accelerator in the world, learning from experts like the CEO of Instacart, Head of Applied Research at OpenAI and the cofounder of Snowflake.<br><br><strong>What do we value?<br><br></strong>We're very intentional about adding new people. We think a small team of exceptional people working hard at a problem they care about will always beat a larger, more unfocused team. That means you'll need to bring an intensity to this role that might not be asked at other companies. But it also means you will be fast tracked into more senior roles and responsibilities far earlier.<br><br>We also believe in hiring people who want ownership and autonomy in their work, and giving it to them. Instead of just being handed tickets, you'll be proactively suggesting metrics that should be monitored and one off analyses that should be done, and proposing improvements to our analytics infrastructure.<br><br><strong>What will I do?<br><br></strong><ul><li>Running analyses in SQL to make decisions on product, marketing spend, and pricing strategy, and communicating your findings, method, and recommendations in a clear way to both technical and non-technical audiences</li><li>Working with stakeholders in the marketing, sales, customer success and product departments to agree metrics that need to be monitored on an ongoing basis, then building visualisations</li><li>Working with data engineers to ensure data is modelled in the correct format to support data visualisation and more detailed analyses<br><br></li></ul><strong>What does our ideal hire look like?<br><br></strong>You've worked at an early stage tech company (&lt;100 people) as a data analyst or similar<li>You have an expert level understanding of both SQL and a data visualization tool (we use Metabase). If you don't know SQL to a very high standard, you shouldn't apply</li><li>You are excellent at communicating your analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences: the results, your recommendations, and the method you used</li><li>You can proactively structure an analysis given only a business problem</li><li>Urgency and intensity in your work<br><br></li><strong>Our tech stack<br><br></strong>Broadly, we use a fairly typical ELT stack.

Simply Business is an online business insurance brokerage that specialises in one thing: protecting the businesses their customers are working hard to build. Since they started life in 2005, they have helped over three million small businesses and self-employed people find the protection that’s right for them, from builders to bakers and personal trainers. Their big idea was to reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible, while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that they believe small businesses and landlords are entitled to.




Their story - continued commitment to doing the right thing




2005 seems like a long time ago. Simply Business – a small company with a big idea. To transform the way that other small businesses could get the insurance that they need. To reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that small businesses are entitled to. To protect them from harm. To keep their livelihoods safe. And to do all this with the promise of positive service. Delivered by happy people, working flexibly, learning constantly. With a restlessly innovative spirit. Within a business committed to doing the right thing. All of the time.




As they've grown, they've tried hard to keep true to this. To ourselves, to their 800 strong team and to the 3.5m customers that they've served so far. And as they move forward, as they enter a big new market, as they grow responsibly, as they improve their products, as they offer their customers more of what they need, of what they deserve, they'll hold onto the focus of that small company with the big idea. Protecting and serving businesses across the UK and the US. From barbers to bakers, consultants to cleaners, they are the backbone of the economy.




And they'll continue to stand by them. Bit by bit helping their dreams grow, just like ours.




Why do they need this role?




This role will sit within the global Data and Analytics team (DNA) in Simply Business. DNA has been central to empowering data-driven decision making at SB. They have invested heavily in their data pipeline, data engineering and their business intelligence capabilities.

Create data models in their Snowflake data warehouse
Integrate new sources of data to enrich their analytical capabilities

Work with various business and engineering teams to ensure reliable, scalable, robust architecture for their analytics platform and ETL pipelines
Partner with stakeholders to identify business use cases and translate them into the right analytical problem that you will build, test and productionize
Particular focus will be on use cases that will help them drive operational efficiencies as the organization scales.
Increase the organization's ability to convert more customers.
Clearly communicate data-driven insights and recommendations to non-technical audiences
Contribute to longer term strategic DNA projects

About Reserv

Reserv is an insurtech creating and incubating cutting-edge AI and automation technology to bring efficiency and simplicity to claims. Founded by insurtech veterans with deep experience in SaaS and digital claims, Reserv is venture-backed by Bain Capital and Altai Ventures and began operations in May 2022. We are focused on automating highly manual tasks to tackle long-standing problems in claims and set a new standard for TPAs, insurance technology providers, and adjusters alike.

We have ambitious (but attainable!) goals and need people who can work in an evolving environment. If building a leading TPA and the prospect of tackling the long-standing challenges of the claims role sounds exciting, we can't wait to meet you.

About the role

As an analyst in a well-funded Series B stage start-up, you will be defining our growth potential for years to come. You will be an integral part of Reserv's data organization, working with our customers to deliver exemplary data management of their claims portfolios.

For this role, we are seeking an analytics professional with strong technical skills and the desire to learn and grow in their role. This role will require you to own day to day reporting and analyses for our customers, all the while automating away mundane and repetitive reporting, while building processes with the operations team that benefit our data asset.

What we need

We need you to do all the things typical to the role:


Work with our data stack: Python (Pandas to Langchain), Postgres, Looker, ECS, Docker etc.
Ship reporting code and operational processes that solve for our customers' needs.
Serve as the analyst responsible for our monthly reporting packages.
Liaise with our operations teams solving for nuanced data issues.
Communicate ideas and specifications through detailed, precise writing.
Influence the culture, values, and processes of a growing technology team.
Enjoy and have fun being creative and thinking outside of the box. You will need to draw on analogous situations you've worked on before, but we are not traversing well-traveled roads. ""Where we're going, we don't need roads!""


Requirements


3-5 years of experience in a data science or analytics role, preferably within the insurance and/or claims space, with experience working independently / in a small team.
Have a proven track record of shipping high quality data analysis at a high cadence.
Experience using modern analytics and programming languages with an emphasis on statistical analysis.
A proven ability to manage relationships with high value customers and communicate with both technical and non-technical audiences alike.
The ability to wear adjacent hats as you grow your scope: analyst, developer, customer manager.
A passion for building intuitive technology and a thirst for learning.


Benefits


Generous health-insurance package
Pension plan with employer contributions
Competitive holiday / leave policy in addition to bank holidays – we want our employees fresh, healthy, happy, and energized!
Industry Qualifications paid by us (after a qualifying period)
Work from anywhere to facilitate your work-life balance
Apple laptop, large second monitor, and other quality-of-life equipment. Technology is something that should make your life easier, not harder!


At Reserv, we value diversity in backgrounds, perspectives, and life experiences and believe that diversity in viewpoints and critical thinking drives innovation, first-principles thinking, and success. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and encourage those from all walks of life to apply. If you believe you are a good fit for this role, we would love to hear from you!

The electricity grid is changing beyond recognition, and without deploying new software to orchestrate it, we'll be unable to decarbonise.

At Axle, we're building the infrastructure that'll underpin the decarbonised energy system. Our software crushes CO2 and energy costs. Our goal is insanely ambitious, and we're building a team to match the scale of this challenge. We've just raised a Seed round from world-leading investors including Accel (TechCrunch) and we're growing fast.

We make the technology to move energy usage to times when electricity is cheap and green. Our software controls vehicle charging, heating systems, and home batteries. We use machine learning to figure out what energy people will need, and when they'll need it. We control tens of thousands of energy assets, and we're growing quickly.

Axle is a unique startup. We're building in a legacy industry and moving gigawatt-hours of electrons in the real world, but we operate at lightning speed. We ship extraordinarily quickly, and we're experts in electricity systems. We're backed by some of the best investors in the world, and we're growing the team to meet customer demand.

Requirements

Read more about what we're building here.

At Axle, we read data from hundreds of thousands of devices every day. We then optimize the performance of those devices, and participate in electricity markets with them. As our business grows, we're looking for a driven data analyst to help build reporting, monitoring, and visualization across the business.

Some things you might work on:


Visualizing the charging patterns of thousands of electric vehicles
Building dashboards to help us understand which devices are online
Tracking our financial performance vs our revenue targets



You'll need:


Tech chops: you'll need comfort with SQL and basic Python knowledge to work with and automate our data processes
Strong analytical skills: you'll be speaking MW, kWh, and £ every day
Commercial instincts: we're looking for somebody who can help us spot opportunities lurking in our data!
A deep-seated motivation to combat climate change
Comfort moving fast in an uncertain and changeable environment



You can expect:


insane amounts of ownership
lots of fascinating data to get to grips with
the support of a world class engineering & commercial team


This role would suit an ambitious generalist with a strong analytical background. We don't care if you've held a role with a similar title before: if you've got a track record of getting things done in complex, data-heavy environments, let's chat.

Interview process


Initial interview
Take-home exercise
Final interview (in-person)
Offer, references, and welcome to the team!

We love the idea of fully remote work but it doesn't... work. For very early stage companies, people learn faster, get on better, and accomplish more when they're spending a decent chunk of time together. We ask that you spend 2-3 days a week in our London office.

We are extremely keen to build a diverse company, and we're particularly eager to hear from candidates who don't fit the traditional role stereotypes. If you're motivated by our mission, please do reach out, even if you feel you might not ‘check all the boxes'.

About Reserv

Reserv is an insurtech creating and incubating cutting-edge AI and automation technology to bring efficiency and simplicity to claims. Founded by insurtech veterans with deep experience in SaaS and digital claims, Reserv is venture-backed by Bain Capital and Altai Ventures and began operations in May 2022. We are focused on automating highly manual tasks to tackle long-standing problems in claims and set a new standard for TPAs, insurance technology providers, and adjusters alike.

We have ambitious (but attainable!) goals and need people who can work in an evolving environment. If building a leading TPA and the prospect of tackling the long-standing challenges of the claims role sounds exciting, we can't wait to meet you.

About the role

As an analyst in a well-funded Series B stage start-up, you will be defining our growth potential for years to come. You will be an integral part of Reserv's data organization, working with our customers to deliver exemplary data management of their claims portfolios.

For this role, we are seeking an analytics professional with strong technical skills and the desire to learn and grow in their role. This role will require you to own day to day reporting and analyses for our customers, all the while automating away mundane and repetitive reporting, while building processes with the operations team that benefit our data asset.

What we need

We need you to do all the things typical to the role:


Work with our data stack: Python (Pandas to Langchain), Postgres, Looker, ECS, Docker etc.
Ship reporting code and operational processes that solve for our customers' needs.
Serve as the analyst responsible for our monthly reporting packages.
Liaise with our operations teams solving for nuanced data issues.
Communicate ideas and specifications through detailed, precise writing.
Influence the culture, values, and processes of a growing technology team.
Enjoy and have fun being creative and thinking outside of the box. You will need to draw on analogous situations you've worked on before, but we are not traversing well-traveled roads. ""Where we're going, we don't need roads!""


Requirements


3-5 years of experience in a data science or analytics role, preferably within the insurance and/or claims space, with experience working independently / in a small team.
Have a proven track record of shipping high quality data analysis at a high cadence.
Experience using modern analytics and programming languages with an emphasis on statistical analysis.
A proven ability to manage relationships with high value customers and communicate with both technical and non-technical audiences alike.
The ability to wear adjacent hats as you grow your scope: analyst, developer, customer manager.
A passion for building intuitive technology and a thirst for learning.


Benefits


Generous health-insurance package
Pension plan with employer contributions
Competitive holiday / leave policy in addition to bank holidays – we want our employees fresh, healthy, happy, and energized!
Industry Qualifications paid by us (after a qualifying period)
Work from anywhere to facilitate your work-life balance
Apple laptop, large second monitor, and other quality-of-life equipment. Technology is something that should make your life easier, not harder!


At Reserv, we value diversity in backgrounds, perspectives, and life experiences and believe that diversity in viewpoints and critical thinking drives innovation, first-principles thinking, and success. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and encourage those from all walks of life to apply. If you believe you are a good fit for this role, we would love to hear from you!

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for fresh graduates who meet the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Enrolled in a quantitative Master’s program (e.g. Business Intelligence Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2024 or spring/summer 2025
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights



Preferred Qualifications


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects
Ability to learn new systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, San Francisco Bay Area, or New York City. We are hiring these positions in Chicago, IL or Toronto, Ontario, Canada.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$181,700. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$181,700. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$181,700. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Chainlink Labs is the primary contributing developer of Chainlink, the decentralized computing platform powering the verifiable web. Chainlink is the industry-standard platform for providing access to real-world data, offchain computation, and secure cross-chain interoperability across any blockchain. Chainlink Labs helps power verifiable applications for banking, DeFi, global trade, and gaming by collaborating with some of the world’s largest financial institutions, notably Swift, DTCC, and ANZ. Chainlink Labs also works with top Web3 teams, including Aave, Compound, GMX, Maker, and Synthetix. Chainlink Labs was ranked in Newsweek’s 100 Most Loved Workplaces 2023 in both the United States and United Kingdom.

Chainlink Labs is pioneering the world’s first fully sustainable and decentralized oracle network, and the Economics team is searching for a Senior Analyst to play a critical role in building it. This role will sit at the intersection of blockchain technology, financial innovation, and economic systems, and shape the future of decentralized economics.

As a Senior Analyst, you will combine economics, data science, and blockchain expertise to shape incentives, optimize network design, and influence the decision-making of our Economics and Executive Leadership teams. You will design, analyze, and operationalize economic models for production applications. You will collaborate across departments to bring innovative solutions from concept to production, ensuring economic soundness and scalability throughout.

This is a high-impact role, offering visibility and influence as you contribute to the development of the Chainlink network. If you’re a meticulous, creative, and motivated individual ready to solve complex economic problems through data-driven decisions in the rapidly evolving world of Web3, this is the role for you.

Your Impact


You'll serve two primary functions: (1) designing and performing analyses that help the Economics and Executive Leadership teams make informed, data-driven decisions, and (2) building and maintaining systems for the parameterization of production applications.
You'll work on a wide array of blockchain economics projects, analyses, and systems, including:
Designing novel mechanisms and incentive schemes
Building models and simulations to evaluate investment opportunities
Designing and parameterizing trading systems
Optimizing parameters for production applications
Contributing to the design of Economics programs and applications
You'll optimize network incentives and systems by engaging directly with the Economics, Product, Engineering, Research, and Data Science teams to understand network dynamics at the deepest level.
You'll operationalize processes and analytics systems, and coordinate cross-functionally to implement them.
This is both a highly technical and highly social role. You will have high visibility and a large impact on how Chainlink builds the world’s first fully sustainable decentralized oracle network.

Requirements


5+ years experience in a quantitative role, particularly trading or quant research
A deep understanding of financial and crypto markets and incentives
Extensive financial modeling background, including data engineering and model automation
Strong SQL and Python skills are mandatory
Experience solving economic problems through statistical/econometric analyses
Substantial data analysis and/or data science experience
Meticulous attention to detail.


Preferred Qualifications


Strong Economics and/or Finance background through Masters-level academics and/or multiple years of industry experience.
Strong organizational and coordination skills necessary to productionize/operationalize processes and applications.
Preferably smart contract programming experience (Rust, Go, Solidity), but familiarity with smart contract code and dApp architecture at a minimum
Published research with an economics or crypto focus (e.g., papers on MEV or PBS, staking and slashing dynamics, node compensation, tokenomics, etc.)
