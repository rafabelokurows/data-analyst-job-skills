Bol continuously advances its platform to create a better tomorrow for over 13 million customers and over 50,000 trading partners. Our Advertising via bol (Avb) propositions, which help shoppers discover products and help advertisers reach shoppers, play an important role in bol’s ambitions – and this is where you’ll make the difference. As Avb Marketing, we help and engage thousands of our advertisers.

Marketing Analytics play an instrumental role here. Our goal is to enable ‘Engagement at Scale’. As a Marketing Data Analyst, you’ll analyze our advertising partners’ behavior, uncover opportunities for improvement and share actionable insights with our marketeers so that our campaigns reach the right audience at the right time. In all your decisions, you’ll take scalability into account as we serve thousands of active advertisers at any given moment.

The biggest challenge

Advertising via Bol is growing fast and becoming increasingly important for bol. The number of colleagues, the complexity of the tech, and the breadth of initiatives are rapidly expanding. Data needs and requests for more insights are no exception. At the same time, we’re implementing Marketing Automation tools to improve our capabilities. This requires us to work pragmatically and focus on achieving the required outcomes. You rise to the occasion to ensure that the underlying data of our campaigns is robust, can be used effectively and responsibly and iterate quickly.

What You’ll Do As An Marketing Data Analyst

You’ll join a team of marketing data analysts in bol’s Avb Marketing Analytics team, which aims to help the marketing teams to create more engaging and impactful campaigns through data.

Your Workload Covers Three Main Areas


You help our marketeers by creating insights to understand advertiser behavior, help optimize campaigns, and drive data-driven decisions. All with the goal of building and optimizing campaigns that help and engage advertisers
You help build, maintain and simplify our data model that supports our communication flows. All with the goal of enabling scalable campaigning where we reach thousands of advertisers at a relevant moment
You analyze the performance of our campaigns and attribute their commercial value. All with the goal of identifying opportunities for improvement and getting a clear picture of the impact we’re making as a department


We’re Looking For You If You


Don’t want to work alone. You work closely with various stakeholders to make the above possible. This requires strong communication skills to bridge the gap between Marketeers, Analysts and Product Engineers;
Challenge ideas. You help the team with the other Marketing data analysts to reach a higher level, both in terms of content and on a personal level.
Help implement best practice around tools and concepts like: Git, SQL, Dbt, data testing, monitoring, and alerting, to create a state-of-the-art analytics environment that enforces quality standards;
Help model pipelines, optimize queries, and apply best practices. You also actively collaborate within bol’s wider analytics engineering and data engineering community to improve our data stack at scale;
Practice and preach Clean Code principles such as DRY and Clean, Clear and Concise;
Know a thing or two about data engineering, analytics engineering or business intelligence engineering and know your way around a marketing automation tooling (such as Marigold Engage).


3 reasons why this is (not) for you Switch to find out


Uncomfortable with ambiguity Our data landscape evolves, and you’ll need to navigate it confidently, so an entrepreneurial mindset is a must. Bol is complex, you have to involve and convince both Product & Tech colleagues to find solutions, proactively and autonomously.
Output over outcome If your work ends when you complete a dashboard – who cares how users experience it – then this job is not for you. We’re looking to find real solutions for our marketing teams to build solid campaigns!
No continuous improvement We’re always learning from our analyses and work to improve our ways-of-working.
Sharing is caring You have hands-on experience in marketing analytics, SQL (e.g. BigQuery), statistics (the basics) and feel comfortable navigating and analyzing large, complex datasets.
High quality code results in clear and actionable insights Finetuning queries, data models, and coding principles make you smile and SQL, Git and dashboarding tools like Tableau/Looker Studio are your home away from home. *Dbt and/or Airflow is a plus.
You are not a one-trick-pony Our role is multi-faceted so you can translate data to opportunity and opportunity to campaign building blocks. It starts with extracting campaign opportunities from data and ends with realizing the data foundation for scalable marketing campaigns.


This is where you’ll work

You’ll join a team of four Marketing Data Analysts which supports our multidisciplinary Avb Marketing team. Your marketing colleagues are seasoned in the world of data and CRM. Sparring happens on a daily basis. We like to make each other better – motivating and respecting are second nature to us.

Besides the strategic topics, you have the space to work on your own innovations and seize the opportunities you identify. Bol gladly invests in your personal and professional growth; development is a primary employment condition. The culture is informal, down-to-earth, and pioneering.

We work in collaborative spaces where you’ll work alongside other data enthusiasts, enjoying a mix of open areas and quiet corners. Our most important stakeholders in Marketing, Sales and Product are just a stroll away.

It is our responsibility to enable an environment that unleashes the power of diversity.

Bol is always advancing its platform to create a better tomorrow for over 13 million customers and 49,000 trading partners. Our advertising propositions help shoppers discover products and advertisers reach customers – this is where you’ll make a difference. You’ll use data to help our advertising customers inform decisions, frame conversations, and change perceptions. And you’ll ensure it’s used effectively and responsibly.

The biggest challenge

Advertising via Bol is growing fast and is becoming an increasingly important channel for our advertising customers. Their need for data and insights are no exception. They rely on us to provide them with meaningful metrics, insightful analyses, and reliable predictive models to keep investing effectively

What You’ll Do As a Data Analyst

You’ll join 15 analysts in Bol’s advertising analytics organization. Together you share a mission of making people performant through analytics. This role is for the versatile analyst who is equally comfortable working with data as engaging with stakeholders. You’ll work with stakeholders to identify high value use cases for analytics, use SQL, Python, Dbt, and Tableau to then create metrics, do analysis across petabytes of data, make meaningful predictions, to eventually help advertising customers make better decisions. Your work will be input for amongst others client meetings, white papers, webinars, and public industry appearances.


You work closely with internal stakeholders (Sales, Customer Success, and Marketing) and top advertising and agency customers to identify high value applications of analytics.
You’re curious and develop deep domain knowledge to create meaningful language around our data and insights for our customers.
You prioritize, design, and perform analysis and/or dashboards.
You deliver insights and predictions through engaging dashboards and presentations.
You develop extensive domain knowledge to effectively manage and analyse advertising KPIs.
You write high quality and easily interpretable SQL and Python code that can be reused by colleagues and scales easily as data volumes increase.


3 reasons why this is (not) for you Switch to find out


If you strongly value clarity No, if innovating, autonomy, and ambiguity sound terrifying to you.
You only want to process data No, if you only want to process data and prefer someone else to handle project and stakeholder management.
If you believe analysts don’t need domain knowledge No, if you don't want to dive into the world of advertising. Curiosity and willingness to learn about our domain and customers are key to your success.
You’re an analytics professional Yes, if you have 5+ year experience delighting decision makers with your analytical skills. SQL is a must, Python scripting is a strong plus.
Obsess over building the right things Yes, if you believe output does not equal outcome and judge success by value creation.

You’ll use data to help our advertising customers inform decisions, frame conversations, and change perceptions. And you’ll ensure it’s used effectively and responsibly.<br><br><strong> The biggest challenge <br><br></strong>Advertising via Bol is growing fast and is becoming an increasingly important channel for our advertising customers. Their need for data and insights are no exception. They rely on us to provide them with meaningful metrics, insightful analyses, and reliable predictive models to keep investing effectively<br><br><strong>What You’ll Do As a Data Analyst<br><br></strong>You’ll join 15 analysts in Bol’s advertising analytics organization. Together you share a mission of making people performant through analytics. This role is for the versatile analyst who is equally comfortable working with data as engaging with stakeholders. You’ll work with stakeholders to identify high value use cases for analytics, use SQL, Python, Dbt, and Tableau to then create metrics, do analysis across petabytes of data, make meaningful predictions, to eventually help advertising customers make better decisions. Your work will be input for amongst others client meetings, white papers, webinars, and public industry appearances.<br><br><ul><li> You work closely with internal stakeholders (Sales, Customer Success, and Marketing) and top advertising and agency customers to identify high value applications of analytics. </li><li> You’re curious and develop deep domain knowledge to create meaningful language around our data and insights for our customers. </li><li> You prioritize, design, and perform analysis and/or dashboards. </li><li> You deliver insights and predictions through engaging dashboards and presentations. </li><li> You develop extensive domain knowledge to effectively manage and analyse advertising KPIs. </li><li> You write high quality and easily interpretable SQL and Python code that can be reused by colleagues and scales easily as data volumes increase. <br><br></li></ul><strong>3 reasons why this is (not) for you</strong> <strong>Switch to find out<br><br></strong><ul><li> If you strongly value clarity No, if innovating, autonomy, and ambiguity sound terrifying to you. </li><li> You only want to process data No, if you only want to process data and prefer someone else to handle project and stakeholder management. </li><li> If you believe analysts don’t need domain knowledge No, if you don't want to dive into the world of advertising. Curiosity and willingness to learn about our domain and customers are key to your success. </li><li> You’re an analytics professional Yes, if you have 5+ year experience delighting decision makers with your analytical skills. SQL is a must, Python scripting is a strong plus. </li><li> Obsess over building the right things Yes, if you believe output does not equal outcome and judge success by value creation. </li><li> You get (and create) energy by working with others Yes, if you can translate technical information into language anyone can understand. You enjoy working with both data and people. <br><br></li></ul><strong> It is our responsibility to enable an environment that unleashes the power of diversity.</strong>

As a Power BI Consultant, you advise our customers on data & analytics ambitions and challenges. During the exploratory discussions with our (potential) customers, you will recognise their goals, bottlenecks, and needs. You translate them into a tangible solution using Power BI. You do much more than just creating dashboards.




In your role as a Power BI Consultant, you develop data models and analytics solutions on which our customers can make intelligent data-driven decisions. Of course, your solutions are beautiful, they work intuitively, and they provide the correct information. In addition to your technical skills, you also have an eye for the business that enables you to operate as a true advisor. You do not simply create what your customers ask for, but what they need. After all, it is your profession!




Your most important tasks as a Power BI Consultant:




You analyse the ambitions and challenges of our customers;
You develop good management information for your customers based on your analysis;
You develop robust data models and create effective visual appealing dashboards in Power BI;
You work with Microsoft Azure Technology and Power BI.




What does Rockfeather have to offer?




Rockfeather gives you the complete freedom to continue your development as a Power BI specialist or become a more all-around Data & Analytics Consultant. You want to give your experience an extra boost by using the latest technologies and not getting stuck in existing technology and with the same customers. The variety of ambitious customers and the latest technology are more the rule than the exception for us. Together we are passionate about the possibilities of data-driven working and offering the best solution for our customers. Our teams with Data Analytics, Data Integration, Data Science, and Low-code colleagues share their knowledge and network so that together we can realise impactful projects and unique solutions. We understand that the quality of your life determines the quality of your work. That is why we offer a complete package to take good care of yourself and your loved ones.

Just like every other company, we think we are unique, and we are 'the place to be.' The truth is that we are not 'the place to be' for a lot of people. If you are looking for a place to build a career in our 'management' or if you like everything clean and crisp between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., then look somewhere else.




At Rockfeather, we put craftsmanship first. We are passionate about what we do; embracing technology to empower ambitious people. If you want all the freedom and support to develop your skills to become the next ‘data guru’, then Rockfeather is the place for you. We also offer the opportunity to buy shares of the team you work in, the ultimate way to bring your entrepreneurship to the next level!




Job requirements




What do you bring to the table?




You preferably have a completed Bachelor's degree. But in the end, your skills and attitude make the real difference.
You have a minimum of one year of experience with Power BI, and preferably also DAX and SQL;

With 13.5 million customers, a catalog of 38 million products, and 48,000 partner sellers, the success of our financial processes hinges on exceptional sophistication and reliability. As Data Analyst FinTech and Finance, you’ll drive the transformation of complex financial data into clear, actionable insights that improve decision-making across our organization. Your analysis will directly impact how we optimize financial processes, improve partner experiences, and deliver additional customer value.

The biggest challenge

Developing and implementing scalable analytics solutions in an environment where traditional financial models converge with platform dynamics. The complexity of our operation – processing millions of transactions across multiple business models – demands very particular approaches to financial data analysis. You’ll need to combine technical precision with business acumen, transforming vast datasets into insights that demonstrably drive strategic decisions. And this role requires more than analytical excellence; you’ll also have to influence stakeholders and promote a data-driven culture across finance and business teams.

What You'll Do As Data Analyst FinTech And Finance

Your primary focus will be designing and implementing automated analytics solutions that scale with our growing platform. From developing robust reconciliation frameworks to creating intuitive dashboards, you’ll ensure our financial reporting is accurate and actionable. You’ll also serve as a strategic advisor, helping teams understand and act on the financial implications of new propositions and process changes.

Responsibilities

Working closely with product teams and finance stakeholders, you’ll take ownership of end-to-end analytics projects. This includes conceptualizing solutions, building automated workflows, and implementing monitoring systems that ensure sustained value delivery. You’ll champion data-driven approaches, demonstrating through concrete results how analytics can and should improve business outcomes. Key responsibilities:


Design and implement scalable, automated financial analytics solutions
Develop comprehensive dashboards that provide deep insight into transaction flows
Create analytical frameworks that assist financial teams in commercial decision-making
Lead complex data initiatives from conception through successful implementation
Advise stakeholders on data-driven process optimizations
Build and maintain critical financial connections and reconciliation systems
Drive adoption of data-driven practices across finance and business teams


Why you can make a difference

You combine deep analytical expertise with a strong business sense and proven stakeholder management skills. With a relevant Master’s degree and at least 5 years of data analytics experience in finance, you have the theoretical foundation and practical expertise to drive immediate impact. Your technical skills span SQL, dashboard development, and data storytelling, and you take a systematic approach to problem-solving. You also know how to communicate your ideas convincingly, and collaborate with relevant business stakeholders to ensure your solutions generate long-term value.

3 reasons why this is (not) for you Switch to find out


Detail obsessed You get lost in striving for technical perfection at the expense of making business impact
Solo performer You prefer independent analysis to collaborative problem-solving

Bovendien bieden wij organisaties ondersteuning met trainingen en het beantwoorden van specifieke vragen, zoals het ontsluiten van data uit verschillende bronnen.

Bedrijven en mensen die aan de slag willen met Power BI komen veelal via een korte online zoektocht bij ons uit.

As a Data Analyst, you gather and analyse data from the exoskeleton to learn from its errors. You ensure that the exoskeleton generates readable data and you help your teammates make design choices using the data of previous years. Besides that you help with all things data, like processing data from the depth camera or EEG, and you develop software together with the control and software engineers. Do you have a desire to translate abstract data into a concrete solution? Then the Data Analyst function is for you!

What You Will Do As Data Analyst

As a Data Analyst you will develop software focused on data from the exoskeleton.

You write scripts to analyse data from previous years to help your teammates find the required specifications of, for example, a new motor. Furthermore, you monitor the exoskeleton during training by keeping track of all the live sensor data. There is also plenty of room to add new things, such as new sensors. All to eventually analyze the data and be able to draw conclusions on what could make the exoskeleton even more efficient, faster, more reliable and smarter!

Beheren van de enterprise rapportages en dashboards in Power BI;

De ideale kandidaat

Is iemand die data-minded en analytisch goed onderbouwd is en energie haalt uit de samenwerking met collega’s van verschillende afdelingen en zich kan verplaatsen in de behoefte van de eindgebruiker. Daarnaast beschik je over:

kennis van Power BI en SQL ;
kennis van DAX measures;
kennis van data modellen volgens de Kimball standaard;
minimaal over HBO werk- en denkniveau met bij voorkeur een bedrijfskundige achtergrond. Ervaring in een data-analyse omgeving is een pré;
Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en beheersing van de Nederlandse taal in woord en geschrift;
Krijgt energie van agile-scrum werken.




Wat kan je van ons verwachten?

Een uitdagende baan waarbij je werkzaam bent in ons inspirerende kantoor in Rotterdam.
Hybride werken: een goede balans tussen thuis en op kantoor werken.
Professionele en leuke collega’s.
Een prettige informele werksfeer.
De kans om je op persoonlijk en professioneel vlak te ontwikkelen.

As a Power BI Consultant, you advise our customers on data & analytics ambitions and challenges. During the exploratory discussions with our (potential) customers, you will recognise their goals, bottlenecks, and needs. You translate them into a tangible solution using Power BI. You do much more than just creating dashboards.




In your role as a Power BI Consultant, you develop data models and analytics solutions on which our customers can make intelligent data-driven decisions. Of course, your solutions are beautiful, they work intuitively, and they provide the correct information. In addition to your technical skills, you also have an eye for the business that enables you to operate as a true advisor. You do not simply create what your customers ask for, but what they need. After all, it is your profession!




Your most important tasks as a Power BI Consultant:




You analyse the ambitions and challenges of our customers;
You develop good management information for your customers based on your analysis;
You develop robust data models and create effective visual appealing dashboards in Power BI;
You work with Microsoft Azure Technology and Power BI.




What does Rockfeather have to offer?




Rockfeather gives you the complete freedom to continue your development as a Power BI specialist or become a more all-around Data & Analytics Consultant. You want to give your experience an extra boost by using the latest technologies and not getting stuck in existing technology and with the same customers. The variety of ambitious customers and the latest technology are more the rule than the exception for us. Together we are passionate about the possibilities of data-driven working and offering the best solution for our customers. Our teams with Data Analytics, Data Integration, Data Science, and Low-code colleagues share their knowledge and network so that together we can realise impactful projects and unique solutions. We understand that the quality of your life determines the quality of your work. That is why we offer a complete package to take good care of yourself and your loved ones.

Just like every other company, we think we are unique, and we are 'the place to be.' The truth is that we are not 'the place to be' for a lot of people. If you are looking for a place to build a career in our 'management' or if you like everything clean and crisp between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., then look somewhere else.




At Rockfeather, we put craftsmanship first. We are passionate about what we do; embracing technology to empower ambitious people. If you want all the freedom and support to develop your skills to become the next ‘data guru’, then Rockfeather is the place for you. We also offer the opportunity to buy shares of the team you work in, the ultimate way to bring your entrepreneurship to the next level!




Job requirements




What do you bring to the table?




You preferably have a completed Bachelor's degree. But in the end, your skills and attitude make the real difference.
You have a minimum of one year of experience with Power BI, and preferably also DAX and SQL;
You have proven experience with having helped to translate needs into robust data models;
You have knowledge of information analysis, KPI development and Data modelling;

As Data Analyst FinTech and Finance, you’ll drive the transformation of complex financial data into clear, actionable insights that improve decision-making across our organization. Your analysis will directly impact how we optimize financial processes, improve partner experiences, and deliver additional customer value.

The biggest challenge

Developing and implementing scalable analytics solutions in an environment where traditional financial models converge with platform dynamics. The complexity of our operation – processing millions of transactions across multiple business models – demands very particular approaches to financial data analysis. You’ll need to combine technical precision with business acumen, transforming vast datasets into insights that demonstrably drive strategic decisions. And this role requires more than analytical excellence; you’ll also have to influence stakeholders and promote a data-driven culture across finance and business teams.

What You'll Do As Data Analyst FinTech And Finance

As a key member of the FinTech/Finance Data team, you’ll lead initiatives that define and enhance our financial data capabilities and promote data-driven decision-making.

Responsibilities

Create analytical frameworks that assist financial teams in commercial decision-making

Advise stakeholders on data-driven process optimizations
Build and maintain critical financial connections and reconciliation systems

Why you can make a difference

Your technical skills span SQL, dashboard development, and data storytelling, and you take a systematic approach to problem-solving. You also know how to communicate your ideas convincingly, and collaborate with relevant business stakeholders to ensure your solutions generate long-term value.

3 reasons why this is (not) for you Switch to find out


Detail obsessed You get lost in striving for technical perfection at the expense of making business impact
Solo performer You prefer independent analysis to collaborative problem-solving

Collaborative thinker You thrive on building cross-functional partnerships that amplify your strategic value


Where you'll work

Je bent de onmisbare sparringpartner in besluitvorming over hoe middelen effectief en efficiënt in te zetten en je verbindt beleid en data. Daarnaast werk je nauw samen met partners binnen het cluster sociaal.

Dit bereik je onder andere door dataverzoeken op te pakken. Daarnaast sluit je aan als vaste data analist binnen projecten en programma’s van onze directie. Collega’s inspireren om meer met data en informatie te gaan werken, is ook onderdeel van deze functie.
