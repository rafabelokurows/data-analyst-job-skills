Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

This is a temporary position with an anticipated end date of December 31, 2027.

Around the world, cities are bringing the practice of innovation into government to address the most pressing urban challenges and improve the quality of life for residents. The City of Seattle is home to an innovation unit – Innovation & Performance – that deploys a range of strategies, including quantitative and qualitative research, design-based innovation, and solid project management to bring greater clarity and new solutions to the city’s most pressing problems. The team’s multi-disciplinary approach leverages skills and tools from design thinking, behavioral science, and analytics to help tackle hard-to-solve public challenges.

The Mayor’s Office of Innovation & Performance is seeking a Data Analytics & Innovation Advisor to lead engagements with City departments with emphasis on data for more responsive, effective and accountable government. We are looking for someone to work with high-performing teams, monitor progress towards a goal, work with government and community leaders, and communicate respectfully to diverse stakeholders around a shared vision for achieving results. This position supports City departments to find impactful solutions to the complex issues facing city governments. The Advisor is curious and comfortable working with partners not only on research and design, but implementation and adoption of new processes and innovative approaches, helping the City take risks to test bold ideas, while always keeping residents in mind.

The Advisor is housed in Seattle Information Technology (IT) and is matrixed to Innovation & Performance for day-to-day management. This arrangement enables the position to work centrally with the authority of the Mayor’s Office, collaborate across departments, while using tools and standards of the Seattle IT department.

The City’s Innovation & Performance (IP) team was established in 2017, bringing together staff into a new unit focused on improving the effectiveness, efficiency, and accountability of City government. As a multi-disciplinary team, IP works across departments and communities to incubate new insights, experiment, and deliver results for the people of Seattle. IP seeks to deliver sustainable solutions, in short-order, that can be used independently by departments after the conclusion of our projects.

Job Responsibilities

You will be successful in this role if you are excited about working productively with City departments and external partners to develop creative, ambitious solutions to civic challenges.

Key Responsibilities Include


Support Mayoral and City key priorities with high-impact projects and analysis by bridging business and mission needs with technical and advanced data approaches. Support collaboration, empower City Hall and City departments, and support key action plans and sophisticated projects with program management, advanced analytics, data modeling, algorithm design, data science techniques, and collaboration.
The main responsibility for this position is to support the development of the analytical framework for the programs that address the challenge of clean, safe, and revitalized downtown neighborhood and downtown business districts, including:
Unlocking and connecting disparate data sources to improve program impact and decision-making through analysis, reporting, and collection of data;
Leading and advancing cross-functional teams and collective efforts to advance data practices and conduct business metric analysis review;
Creating data insights to inform the City’s policies and approaches and track progress on important measures;
Using data to monitor policy changes and make recommendations on strategy development, program design, deployment of resources, and data approaches;
Conducting quantitative and qualitative analysis to identify root causes of complex social and economic problems;
Translating analysis and developing materials to successfully communicate research findings;
Developing quantitative metrics and targets and tracking progress towards performance targets.


Qualifications

We are looking for a person with the below skills and the potential to gain others:


A bachelor's degree in business analytics, computer science, public administration, or another closely related field, or equivalent experience.
Two or more years of experience in a data management and/or data coordination role.
The ability to process large, complex data sets with computational procedures in Python.
Experience creating and maintaining reproducible procedures to download or connect to, filter, clean, and analyze data and information from multiple disparate data sources.
Experience with business intelligence tools such as Tableau and PowerBI in a production environment and using mixed media to create visually appealing communication tools (e.g., websites, reports, and presentations).


A successful Data Analytics & Innovation Advisor:

Collaborative. Building and maintaining professional relationships with colleagues, supervisors, community partner representatives, elected officials and their staff is essential for success.

Sees the forest and the trees (and the next forest over). At times, this advisor will need to focus on a small part of a bigger picture -- without forgetting how it fits into the larger project and anticipating how it will work with the project after that. Top project managers can think ahead and to think critically, feeling empowered to ask, ""has anyone considered what happens if...?""

Capable of juggling multiple things at once. Innovation & Performance is a fast-paced environment, where a team member might work on several high-priority projects at once. We value an ability to prioritize tasks and accomplish them on time.

Can learn as they go. The nature of the work means that there isn't always a clear solution. The most successful candidates can work in an environment where finding the right answer takes some time and identifying resources that can help is crucial.

Can both lead and be part of teams. Even a relatively small proposal might require input from elected officials, executive staff, department staff, policy staff, community members, and external partners. You may lead an interdepartmental team or be part of one. You will need to guide action but also independently conduct analysis and research.

Can be a number cruncher in addition to an ethnographer. Our team includes a human-centered designer and data analytics staff; a successful candidate brings an ability to gather and synthesize quantitative and qualitative data.

As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

The Sales Strategy & Operations (SS&O) team partners with advertising sales leaders across sales strategy and analytics, operations and process and tools. Team members are experts in business strategy and operations and analytical and strategic thinking. They are pragmatic and results-oriented. As a Business Intelligence Analyst, you will focus on empowering sales leadership and the broader sales organization with self-serve access to data and insights. You’ll be responsible for designing, building and maintaining scaled sales analytics solutions (dashboards, data tables) for over one thousand internal users.

What You’ll Do


Collaborate with SS&O team members and sales leaders to define key business metrics and gather requirements for which insights should be made available at scale. Architect data pipelines, design and build new Tableau dashboards for stakeholders to use to address their needs. Maintain and improve existing sales data infrastructure and Tableau dashboards based on evolving business requirements.
Democratize sales data by enabling self-serve access to key business drivers, trends and operating metrics. Design fully automated dashboards that are easy to understand, enable self-serve access for the sales org, and can be used by a broad audience with a variety of use cases.
Publish and maintain clear documentation to inform and educate users at scale, gather feedback to identify opportunities for improvement.
Identify ways to streamline and improve the efficiency of our data. Implement changes to our infrastructure (optimize SQL queries and data workflows) to improve the landing time of our data.
Work with cross-functional teams including Sales, Strategic Finance, and Business Intelligence to identify data needs and gaps, and align on solutions.
Lead projects end to end, see around corners and provide thought partnership to your team.



What We’re Looking For


3+ years of professional experience in highly analytical environments such as management consulting, investment banking, corporate strategy or technology/media companies.
Understanding of sales and digital advertising platforms and working knowledge of sales systems and tools (Salesforce).
Strong data analytics and business intelligence skills - querying large data sets with advanced SQL, building visualizations with Tableau. Experience building and maintaining data pipelines (authoring, scheduling, monitoring workflows).
Ability to visualize complex data sets that provide insights and clearly inform areas of action.
Passion for building new solutions and enabling analysis at scale to drive decision-making.
Experience in a complex, fast-paced environment.
Organized, detail-oriented and strategically focused.
Strong written and verbal communication skills.
Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as business administration, or equivalent experience.



Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement


We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.
This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 1-2 times/month and therefore needs to be in a commutable distance from the NY office.



At Pinterest we believe the workplace should be equitable, inclusive, and inspiring for every employee.

Departmental Overview

UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business offers a unique opportunity to champion new ideas, collaborate across boundaries, and continually learn in a workplace committed to increasing diversity and creating a welcoming environment for all. Our distinctive culture is captured within our four Defining Leadership Principles: Question the Status Quo, Confidence Without Attitude, Students Always, and Beyond Yourself. These principles distinguish Berkeley Haas as a unique environment conducive to teamwork, collaboration, and career growth.

This position will work with a Professor in the Haas School of Business on a specific research project, one designed to study whether “high road” worker- owned companies can create high-quality jobs and improve productivity despite the fact that the low market share of these organizational forms suggest that the benefits may not usually arise or that market imperfections may impede their growth. This study therefore looks at worker-owned companies in California and will explore whether public policies could cost-effectively promote them. The study will focus particularly on whether worker ownership fits well with the needs of workers from historically disadvantaged groups.

Serve as the go-to expert on the data product, deeply understanding tools (currently Snowflake + Sisense), managing configurations, and collaborating with engineers and the product team to optimize infrastructure, transformations, and sustainability.
Ensure that all data products, analyses, and dashboards remain PHI-compliant and meet security/privacy standards such as HIPAA.
Collaborate with the Group Product Manager and engineering team to define product vision and roadmap goals for DataStudio, aligning initiatives with business objectives and customer needs while overseeing execution, delivery, and platform maintenance (including version updates and performance tuning).
Train customers and internal stakeholders on dashboards, reports, and BI tools, tailoring sessions to technical skill levels, and addressing support tickets related to data quality, reporting issues, or dashboard configuration.
Provide guidance during data implementations to ensure seamless customer onboarding and maintain comprehensive documentation on available reports, dashboards, and best practices.
Contribute to internal knowledge bases, ensuring teams have clear, up-to-date references for all data-related workflows and policies.

Familiarity with Sisense or other BI tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).
Demonstrated ability to build dashboards and BI solutions that inform strategic decisions.

Prior healthcare software experience, preferred
Understanding of healthcare data and privacy standards such as HIPAA compliance, preferred
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Information Systems, Statistics, or a related field preferred.

4150427611,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/data-analyst-at-stripe-4150427611?position=1&pageNum=0&refId=FM9pxpG3qp6G20NNchSX0g%3D%3D&trackingId=qjk7V0BtIX8yOGDAm8eZ%2Fg%3D%3D,Data Analyst,Stripe,United States,"About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office.

KFC Corporation, based in Louisville, Kentucky, is one of the few brands in America that can boast about having a rich, 60-year history of success and innovation. In fact, KFC is the world's most popular chicken restaurant chain and a division of Yum! Brands, the world’s largest restaurant company.

Yum! Brands, Inc., based in Louisville, Kentucky, has over 45,000 restaurants in more than 135 countries and territories and is one of the Aon Hewitt Top Companies for Leaders in North America. In 2018, Yum! Brands was recognized as part of the inaugural Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. The company’s restaurant brands – KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell – are global leaders of the chicken, pizza and Mexican-style food categories.

More important than our size is our commitment to breakthrough innovation and the success of our employees. We're proud of the unique culture we've built, one where everyone can be their best self, make a difference and have fun! We believe in our people, trust in their positive intentions, encourage ideas from everyone, and have actively developed a workforce that is diverse in style and background.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

In addition, we will be looking for an individual who can help establish processes and identify opportunities to optimize and scale existing workflows.

We are a full-stack behavioral health services company: we employ therapists, contract with insurance providers for reimbursing care, and run our own tech stack to support across the business. We are a technology-enabled service provider working to increase access to mental health care for insured people in the US. Automation and strong systems are the lynchpin for enabling scale and driving access for more people to get care.

Responsibilities Include:

Communicate sophisticated analyses and results to a wide array of business partners with varying levels of technical expertise.

Preferred Requirements:


4+ years working in analytics/data science preferably with experience at a startup.
4+ years hands on technical analysis work with SQL experience performing complex data transformations. Experience manipulating large data sets and uncovering insights utilizing disparate data sources and tools.
Deep understanding of marketing analytics, including multi-touch attribution models (e.g., first-touch, last-touch, time-decay), media mix modeling, and ROI measurement across channels.
Proven experience using tools like Mixpanel, Google Analytics 4 (GA4), and Tableau to track and analyze marketing performance.
Experience with marketing funnel analysis, including diagnosing drop-offs, conversion bottlenecks, and optimization strategies to improve efficiency.
Track record of improving marketing KPIs, such as CAC, LTV, ROAS, and overall funnel conversion rates through data-driven insights.
Strong analytical skills with the ability to apply business strategy to data analysis and recommendations.
Expert in data visualization (Tableau/Looker/etc).
Strong communication skills. Ability to tell story with data and explain the nuance to stakeholders.
Ability to think strategically (interfacing with senior leaders), while also enjoying being hands-on with the data.
A knack for asking the right questions, then answering them with sound data and analysis.
Experience with dbt/git/aws is a plus.



Octave's Company Values:

The below values drive our day-to-day operations.


We’re human beings first. We operate with empathy and kindness – with our clients, with our collaborators, and with ourselves.
People deserve better than status quo. We’re willing to tackle the intractable problems, no matter how big, because someone should. We ask big questions, we craft big solutions, and we challenge ourselves and others to make it happen.
No bystanders. No stars. No tourists. Each person has been selected to be here, and with that comes a responsibility to bring your expertise, share your ideas, and help make this company better.
Partnership paves the path ahead. We don’t operate in a silo, internally or externally. To transform the system, we believe in working with others to create something bigger, better, and stronger.
Quality is crucial at scale. Quality is core to our business, and we refuse to sacrifice it as we grow.
Progress is a process. In the pursuit of progress, we iterate, reflect, learn, adjust – and always leave things better than we found them.
There are people behind every data point. We recognize that numbers tell only one part of the story, and we also do the work to understand impacts at the individual level



Physical Requirements:


Prolonged periods sitting at a desk and working on a computer.
Must be able to frequently communicate with others through virtual meeting applications such as Zoom and Google Meet.
Must be able to observe and communicate information on company provided laptop.
Move up to 10 pounds on occasion.
Must be eligible to work in the United States without sponsorship now or in the future.



Compensation:

Octave is committed to pay equity. To maintain our commitment to pay equity, Octave will follow Pay Transparency regulations on all open job postings. Current Pay Transparency laws require companies to include a position's salary or hourly wage range (not including bonuses or equity-based compensation) in any internal or external job posting.

Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It’s where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you’ll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You’ll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Creating a life you love also means finding a career that celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences that you bring. As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

The Sales Strategy & Operations (SS&O) team partners with advertising sales leaders across sales strategy and analytics, operations and process and tools. Team members are experts in business strategy and operations and analytical and strategic thinking. They are pragmatic and results-oriented. As a Business Intelligence Analyst, you will focus on empowering sales leadership and the broader sales organization with self-serve access to data and insights. You’ll be responsible for designing, building and maintaining scaled sales analytics solutions (dashboards, data tables) for over one thousand internal users.

What You’ll Do


Collaborate with SS&O team members and sales leaders to define key business metrics and gather requirements for which insights should be made available at scale. Architect data pipelines, design and build new Tableau dashboards for stakeholders to use to address their needs. Maintain and improve existing sales data infrastructure and Tableau dashboards based on evolving business requirements.
Democratize sales data by enabling self-serve access to key business drivers, trends and operating metrics. Design fully automated dashboards that are easy to understand, enable self-serve access for the sales org, and can be used by a broad audience with a variety of use cases.
Publish and maintain clear documentation to inform and educate users at scale, gather feedback to identify opportunities for improvement.
Identify ways to streamline and improve the efficiency of our data. Implement changes to our infrastructure (optimize SQL queries and data workflows) to improve the landing time of our data.
Work with cross-functional teams including Sales, Strategic Finance, and Business Intelligence to identify data needs and gaps, and align on solutions.
Lead projects end to end, see around corners and provide thought partnership to your team.



What We’re Looking For


3+ years of professional experience in highly analytical environments such as management consulting, investment banking, corporate strategy or technology/media companies.
Understanding of sales and digital advertising platforms and working knowledge of sales systems and tools (Salesforce).
Strong data analytics and business intelligence skills - querying large data sets with advanced SQL, building visualizations with Tableau. Experience building and maintaining data pipelines (authoring, scheduling, monitoring workflows).
Ability to visualize complex data sets that provide insights and clearly inform areas of action.
Passion for building new solutions and enabling analysis at scale to drive decision-making.
Experience in a complex, fast-paced environment.
Organized, detail-oriented and strategically focused.
Strong written and verbal communication skills.
Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as business administration, or equivalent experience.



Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement


We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.
This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 1-2 times/month and therefore needs to be in a commutable distance from the NY office.



At Pinterest we believe the workplace should be equitable, inclusive, and inspiring for every employee. In an effort to provide greater transparency, we are sharing the base salary range for this position. The position is also eligible for equity. Final salary is based on a number of factors including location, travel, relevant prior experience, or particular skills and expertise.

Octave is a modern behavioral health practice creating a new standard for care delivery that’s both high-quality and accessible. With in-person and virtual clinics in multiple states, the company offers evidence-based individual, couples, and family therapy, while pioneering relationships with payers to make care more affordable through insurance. By raising the bar on how care is delivered and how providers are supported, we are building a sustainable system that values equity, affordability, and effectiveness.

Job Summary:

Octave is looking for an experienced Senior Data Analyst to join our growing data team. We are looking for an individual to help lay the foundation of analytics and data science at the company with a specific focus on growth and marketing initiatives. The role will help establish operating KPIs and identify opportunities to continue to accelerate the growth of the business. There will be a strong focus on developing engaging data visualizations via dashboards to deliver data driven insights for our business stakeholders. In addition, we will be looking for an individual who can help establish processes and identify opportunities to optimize and scale existing workflows.

We are a full-stack behavioral health services company: we employ therapists, contract with insurance providers for reimbursing care, and run our own tech stack to support across the business. We are a technology-enabled service provider working to increase access to mental health care for insured people in the US. Automation and strong systems are the lynchpin for enabling scale and driving access for more people to get care.

Responsibilities Include:

Communicate sophisticated analyses and results to a wide array of business partners with varying levels of technical expertise.
Create and maintain operational dashboards in Tableau to understand company performance over time and enable partners with self-serve tools.
Develop efficient and scalable end to end workflows and identify opportunities to improve existing processes.
Translating business operations and processes into scalable data and reporting.



Preferred Requirements:


4+ years working in analytics/data science preferably with experience at a startup.
4+ years hands on technical analysis work with SQL experience performing complex data transformations. Experience manipulating large data sets and uncovering insights utilizing disparate data sources and tools.
Deep understanding of marketing analytics, including multi-touch attribution models (e.g., first-touch, last-touch, time-decay), media mix modeling, and ROI measurement across channels.
Proven experience using tools like Mixpanel, Google Analytics 4 (GA4), and Tableau to track and analyze marketing performance.
Experience with marketing funnel analysis, including diagnosing drop-offs, conversion bottlenecks, and optimization strategies to improve efficiency.
Track record of improving marketing KPIs, such as CAC, LTV, ROAS, and overall funnel conversion rates through data-driven insights.
Strong analytical skills with the ability to apply business strategy to data analysis and recommendations.
Expert in data visualization (Tableau/Looker/etc).
Strong communication skills. Ability to tell story with data and explain the nuance to stakeholders.
Ability to think strategically (interfacing with senior leaders), while also enjoying being hands-on with the data.
A knack for asking the right questions, then answering them with sound data and analysis.
Experience with dbt/git/aws is a plus.



Octave's Company Values:

The below values drive our day-to-day operations.


We’re human beings first. We operate with empathy and kindness – with our clients, with our collaborators, and with ourselves.
People deserve better than status quo. We’re willing to tackle the intractable problems, no matter how big, because someone should. We ask big questions, we craft big solutions, and we challenge ourselves and others to make it happen.
No bystanders. No stars. No tourists. Each person has been selected to be here, and with that comes a responsibility to bring your expertise, share your ideas, and help make this company better.
Partnership paves the path ahead. We don’t operate in a silo, internally or externally. To transform the system, we believe in working with others to create something bigger, better, and stronger.
Quality is crucial at scale. Quality is core to our business, and we refuse to sacrifice it as we grow.
Progress is a process. In the pursuit of progress, we iterate, reflect, learn, adjust – and always leave things better than we found them.
There are people behind every data point. We recognize that numbers tell only one part of the story, and we also do the work to understand impacts at the individual level



Physical Requirements:


Prolonged periods sitting at a desk and working on a computer.
Must be able to frequently communicate with others through virtual meeting applications such as Zoom and Google Meet.
Must be able to observe and communicate information on company provided laptop.
Move up to 10 pounds on occasion.
Must be eligible to work in the United States without sponsorship now or in the future.

Starting pay for qualified applicants will depend on a combination of job-related factors, which may include education, training, experience, location, business needs, or market demands. The expected salary range for this role is set forth below and this range may be modified in the future.

The salary range is for zone 1 (all states not in zone 2 or zone 3) $132,100 - $142,600.

The salary range for zone 3 (AK, CA, CT, MA, NJ, NY, WA) is $152,000 - $164,000.

All zones are eligible for equity in the form of stock options.

Additionally, this position is eligible for the following benefits: company sponsored life insurance, disability and AD&D plans.

You’ll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Creating a life you love also means finding a career that celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences that you bring. As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

The Sales Strategy & Operations (SS&O) team partners with advertising sales leaders across sales strategy and analytics, operations and process and tools. Team members are experts in business strategy and operations and analytical and strategic thinking. They are pragmatic and results-oriented. As a Business Intelligence Analyst, you will focus on empowering sales leadership and the broader sales organization with self-serve access to data and insights. You’ll be responsible for designing, building and maintaining scaled sales analytics solutions (dashboards, data tables) for over one thousand internal users.

What You’ll Do


Collaborate with SS&O team members and sales leaders to define key business metrics and gather requirements for which insights should be made available at scale. Architect data pipelines, design and build new Tableau dashboards for stakeholders to use to address their needs. Maintain and improve existing sales data infrastructure and Tableau dashboards based on evolving business requirements.
Democratize sales data by enabling self-serve access to key business drivers, trends and operating metrics. Design fully automated dashboards that are easy to understand, enable self-serve access for the sales org, and can be used by a broad audience with a variety of use cases.
Publish and maintain clear documentation to inform and educate users at scale, gather feedback to identify opportunities for improvement.
Identify ways to streamline and improve the efficiency of our data. Implement changes to our infrastructure (optimize SQL queries and data workflows) to improve the landing time of our data.
Work with cross-functional teams including Sales, Strategic Finance, and Business Intelligence to identify data needs and gaps, and align on solutions.
Lead projects end to end, see around corners and provide thought partnership to your team.



What We’re Looking For


3+ years of professional experience in highly analytical environments such as management consulting, investment banking, corporate strategy or technology/media companies.
Understanding of sales and digital advertising platforms and working knowledge of sales systems and tools (Salesforce).
Strong data analytics and business intelligence skills - querying large data sets with advanced SQL, building visualizations with Tableau. Experience building and maintaining data pipelines (authoring, scheduling, monitoring workflows).
Ability to visualize complex data sets that provide insights and clearly inform areas of action.
Passion for building new solutions and enabling analysis at scale to drive decision-making.
Experience in a complex, fast-paced environment.
Organized, detail-oriented and strategically focused.
Strong written and verbal communication skills.
Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as business administration, or equivalent experience.



Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement


We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.
This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 1-2 times/month and therefore needs to be in a commutable distance from the NY office.



At Pinterest we believe the workplace should be equitable, inclusive, and inspiring for every employee.

Jsme Investown, česká crowdfundingová platforma, a naším cílem je zpřístupnit vyšší výnosy z nemovitostí jednoduše a každému. Rosteme, a tím nám velmi rychle přibývá počet úkolů a dat, která je potřeba zpracovat. Hledáme k nám Performance Data Analytika. Někoho, kdo má zkušenost s datovou analýzou, umí SQL a poradí si s různými datovými nástroji.




🔵 Jak bude vypadat tvá práce

Sledování klíčových metrik výkonnosti (KPI) a reporting pro interní stakeholdery.
Identifikace trendů a příležitostí na základě historických dat a tržních analýz.
Podpora strategického rozhodování prostřednictvím datových analýz a doporučení.
Analýza výkonnosti investičních projektů a portfolií v oblasti nemovitostního crowdfundingu.
Vytváření a správa datových modelů pro predikci výnosnosti a rizik.
Tech Stack: Snowflake, Keboola, Tableau, PostgreSQL.




🔵 S kým budeš nejčastěji spolupracovat

Hlavně s produktovým a marketingovým týmem.
Potkávat se taky budeš s týmem risk managementu a úvěrových analytiků.
Čeká tě spolupráce s externími “dataři” na automatizaci a vizualizaci dat pomocí BI nástrojů.




🔵 Jak si tě představujeme

Zkušenosti s analýzou dat, business intelligence nebo finanční analýzou.
Schopnost pracovat s datovými nástroji jako SQL, Power BI nebo Python (nice to have).
Znalost práce s databázemi a schopnost vytvářet sofistikované reporty.
Analytické a kritické myšlení, schopnosti interpretovat složité datové sady.
Výhodou je zkušenosti z oblasti investic, financí nebo realitního trhu.
Nehledáme někoho, kdo působil na rolích Data Engineer nebo Architect. Řešení už navržené máme, proto hledáme spíš někoho na roli Data Scientist.




🔵 Co ti nabídneme

Práci v odvětví crowdfundingového úvěrování ve firmě, kde má každý možnost ovlivnit její směr.
Premium 4 členství na naší platformě, aby se ti investice ještě více zhodnotily.
Kanceláře ve Foru Karlín, které jsou dog-friendly a mají vlastní kávový bar. Dáš si tak super espresso, flat white. Pro nadšence tu máme i Moccamaster. ☕️
Budget na osobní rozvoj, aby ses mohl/a posouvat dál.
Plně hrazenou Multisportku. 💪
Vždycky můžeš doplnit energii v našem office snack baru. 🍎
Stejně jako všichni u nás budeš mít maximální prostor pro seberealizaci. Chceme tvou iniciativu a nápady.
Čekají tě také pravidelné měsíční Product&Dev Meetups, kdy si rádi zajdeme na bowling, únikovku nebo jakoukoliv jinou aktivitu!




Tak co, potkáme se na pohovoru? 👋

·      Conoscenza di Power Query e linguaggio DAX

 

Puoi essere il prossimo del team se:

·      Sei appassionato del mondo retail

·      Vuoi lavorare per imparare e migliorarti

·      Sei curioso e vivi le sfide come opportunità

This could involve areas of underpayment, errors in royalty calculations, or missing payments altogether. You will focus on both novel and common reporting errors in the industry. Additionally, you will become an expert on different types of royalties and develop expertise in musical earnings over the course of your internship.




We’re seeking someone who learns quickly and is eager to dive in and make a meaningful impact. If you’re not afraid to roll up your sleeves and want to play a role in a changing industry, we’d love to hear from you.




Requirements:

Must-Have:
Students pursuing an academic university degree or recent graduates in econometrics, data science, statistics, or computer/information sciences.
Strong knowledge of SQL.
Strong analytical capabilities.
Eligibility to work in the Netherlands.
Bonus Points For:

Is available at least 3 days a week, and can frequently come to our office in Amsterdam.

У нас большие планы на развитие и рост наших проектов, именно поэтому мы ищем сильнейших экспертов в наши команды.

Data Analyst User Acquisition в нашей компании будет проводить анализ маркетинговых данных, разрабатывать методологии оценки метрик и исследовать неочевидные взаимосвязи метрик.




Наши задачи:

Мы стремимся к принципам бирюзовой организации: нет иерархии, процессы максимально прозрачны, аргументы важнее авторитетов, результаты важнее процессов. У нас компактные команды по 3-5 человек, за каждым из которых закреплена своя зона ответственности, в которой он копит экспертизу. А в команде Аналитики UA очень разнообразно, поэтому если тебе интересно:

решать задачи разного уровня сложности: от проверки гипотез до построения моделей;
разбираться в типах трафика и прокачивать понимание алгоритмов рекламных каналов;
оценивать изменения аудитории и влияние креативов на закупку;
расследовать неочевидные взаимосвязи метрик;
работать над алгоритмом подбора оптимальных ставок;
исследовать каннибализацию игр и многое другое -

тогда нам будет о чем поговорить.




Почему это может быть действительно интересно:

У нас очень много именно маркетинговых данных (показ/клик/открытия).
Никто так как мы глубоко не копает отдельные зоны (например, Атрибуцию).
Очень короткий цикл обратной связи в плане влияния на бизнес – эффект от маркетинга большой, при любых изменениях влияние видно сразу.

Наш стек:

Отличный технический стэк (JupyterHub или databricks + pyspark): современный, переиспользуемый в других компаниях. Все, в чем сотрудник прокачивается работая в Playrix, впоследствии не теряет актуальности и легко монетизируется.
По инструментам не ограничиваем, ресурсы выделяем быстро, весь AWS в нашем распоряжении
Собираем данные через Appsflyer(маркетинговые) и Amplitude (продуктовые)
Сырые данные в S3, ETL на Airflow, подготовленные таблицы и витрины в Redshift. Data Quality, lineage, catalog – Monte Carlo
Аналитики крутят данные SQL-ем и Python-ом в Jupyter/Databricks ноутбуках, прототипы дашбордов делают в Tableau
Развиваем self-service и аналитические продукты для потребителей данных, аналитиков разгружаем от рутины




Мы ожидаем что у вас есть:

отличная математическая подготовка — знание теории вероятностей и прикладной статистики на уровне выпускника технического вуза;
опыт в анализе данных, продуктовой или маркетинговой аналитике;
отличное знание и опыт работы с SQL,
опыт работы с Python;
опыт в ML будет тоже очень кстати;
ориентация на бизнес, умение находить прикладное решение в ограниченное время, не усложнять там, где это не нужно;
проактивная позиция, умение и способность брать на себя ответственность за результат, способность действовать в ситуации неопределенности.




У нас классно, потому что у нас есть:

по-настоящему большой масштаб: сотни миллионов игроков, петабайты данных (храним все за последние 7 лет) и маркетинг ограниченный эффективностью, а не бюджетом
data-driven подход – считаем всё, проводим эксперименты и принимаем решения по данным везде, где это возможно.
все выводы делаем с опорой на статистику, аналитики задают стандарты принятия решений. Даже для сотрудников, далеких от аналитики, доверительные интервалы – не пустой звук.
возможность менять процессы и подходы на более эффективные без долгих согласований и бюрократии.




Мы предлагаем:




Гибкость в работе: у нас гибкий график, и сотрудники могут работать из любой точки мира (кроме РФ и РБ). Для нас не важно, где и как вы выполняете свою работу — мы оцениваем только результаты.

Забота о здоровье и well-being:

Предоставляем ДМС для сотрудников, их партнеров и детей, компенсируем онлайн-сессии с психологом.
Сохраняем 100% зарплату во время отпуска или больничного без лишних справок. А для особых случаев предоставляем дополнительные выходные.
Поддерживаем здоровый образ жизни и компенсируем покупку спортивных абонементов и подписку на фитнес-приложения.

Развитие и обучение:

Оплачиваем участие в профильных конференциях и курсах, проводим внутренние конференции.
Предлагаем скидки на курсы английского языка и языков стран присутствия компании.

Ивенты и мерч:

Регулярно проводим развлекательные и рабочие мероприятия в офлайн режиме: встречи команд, крупные корпоративные вечеринки и более лайтовые пати в офисах.
Также регулярно проводим развлекательные конкурсы, квизы, хакатоны, спортивные челленджи в режиме онлайн.
Собственный магазин мерча с внутренней валютой, где можно купить уникальные подарки. Валюту дарим на значимые даты, также ее можно заработать, участвуя в мероприятиях и брендовых активностях.

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have an absolute love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem, and living inside a spreadsheet/data set to find the answer to any question.
Because you love data, you have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis. Experience with Marketing APIs, Big Query or other Cloud Data Warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.), ETL Tools (Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics) and/or Python are all pluses.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and have spent a minimum of 1 year working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.




What You’ll Do:

Reporting: With your expertise in Advanced Excel, SQL, Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools, you’ll be maintaining customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence, generating pivot tables and other visualizations that summarize thousands of lines of data. You should have experience in translating performance media metrics into coherent, digestible reports for client ad campaigns and be comfortable communicating via Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.
Strategy: You’ll be responsible for learning our clients’ businesses and aligning their media strategy with business goals as well as understanding advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to help guide media buying strategy. With a background in paid media and/or digital advertising, you understand concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue and are able to be engaged in discussions with clients to gain trust and shareholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.




Gupta Media is an office-first (with flexibility) organization and we are excited to have our team working together again

Our client is executing a large-scale data modernization across its agency. This includes creating a consolidated Enterprise Data Platform on modern cloud tools (including AWS & Snowflake,) and re-platforming existing business data applications from solutions such as SAS and legacy databases to the new platform. The data systems enable epidemiologists, public health researchers, state and local public health officials, and business leaders to analyze public health trends and drive policy decisions.




The Data Analyst will support this group in its efforts to implement a new central Data modernization program. The Data Analyst will provide input on best practices and potential efficiencies, work on multiple assignments concurrently to meet aggressive due dates. The Data Analyst will use a range of expert technical skills based on a keen knowledge of data and analytic concepts, and must be proficient with SQL, Python, R, Snowflake, SharePoint, Tableau and/or other Business Intelligence & Programming Tools. This resource needs to have hands on experience analyzing and interpreting complex data needs to develop solutions that improve decision making and operational efficiency. This resource will also be responsible for providing subject matter expertise in the development of requirements as agencies transition to the data modernization program.




In the initial stages of the engagement, the Analyst will be expected to work with data from multiple disparate sources to meet reporting goals. This will be data of varying completeness and quality from systems such as EHRs, enrollment platforms, and operations applications. As the Enterprise Data Platform matures and more data is integrated and improved, the Analyst will use their schools to generate data sets and analysis based on objects in Snowflake. The ideal candidate is comfortable in a maturing landscape and is able to use their data skills and business understanding to answer questions with imperfect systems.
