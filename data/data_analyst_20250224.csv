Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

The Sales Strategy & Operations (SS&O) team partners with advertising sales leaders across sales strategy and analytics, operations and process and tools. Team members are experts in business strategy and operations and analytical and strategic thinking. They are pragmatic and results-oriented. As a Business Intelligence Analyst, you will focus on empowering sales leadership and the broader sales organization with self-serve access to data and insights. You’ll be responsible for designing, building and maintaining scaled sales analytics solutions (dashboards, data tables) for over one thousand internal users.

What You’ll Do


Collaborate with SS&O team members and sales leaders to define key business metrics and gather requirements for which insights should be made available at scale. Architect data pipelines, design and build new Tableau dashboards for stakeholders to use to address their needs. Maintain and improve existing sales data infrastructure and Tableau dashboards based on evolving business requirements.
Democratize sales data by enabling self-serve access to key business drivers, trends and operating metrics. Design fully automated dashboards that are easy to understand, enable self-serve access for the sales org, and can be used by a broad audience with a variety of use cases.
Publish and maintain clear documentation to inform and educate users at scale, gather feedback to identify opportunities for improvement.
Identify ways to streamline and improve the efficiency of our data. Implement changes to our infrastructure (optimize SQL queries and data workflows) to improve the landing time of our data.
Work with cross-functional teams including Sales, Strategic Finance, and Business Intelligence to identify data needs and gaps, and align on solutions.
Lead projects end to end, see around corners and provide thought partnership to your team.



What We’re Looking For


3+ years of professional experience in highly analytical environments such as management consulting, investment banking, corporate strategy or technology/media companies.
Understanding of sales and digital advertising platforms and working knowledge of sales systems and tools (Salesforce).
Strong data analytics and business intelligence skills - querying large data sets with advanced SQL, building visualizations with Tableau. Experience building and maintaining data pipelines (authoring, scheduling, monitoring workflows).
Ability to visualize complex data sets that provide insights and clearly inform areas of action.
Passion for building new solutions and enabling analysis at scale to drive decision-making.
Experience in a complex, fast-paced environment.
Organized, detail-oriented and strategically focused.

Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as business administration, or equivalent experience.



Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement


We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.
This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 1-2 times/month and therefore needs to be in a commutable distance from the NY office.



At Pinterest we believe the workplace should be equitable, inclusive, and inspiring for every employee.

Departmental Overview

UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business offers a unique opportunity to champion new ideas, collaborate across boundaries, and continually learn in a workplace committed to increasing diversity and creating a welcoming environment for all. Our distinctive culture is captured within our four Defining Leadership Principles: Question the Status Quo, Confidence Without Attitude, Students Always, and Beyond Yourself. These principles distinguish Berkeley Haas as a unique environment conducive to teamwork, collaboration, and career growth.

This position will work with a Professor in the Haas School of Business on a specific research project, one designed to study whether “high road” worker- owned companies can create high-quality jobs and improve productivity despite the fact that the low market share of these organizational forms suggest that the benefits may not usually arise or that market imperfections may impede their growth. This study therefore looks at worker-owned companies in California and will explore whether public policies could cost-effectively promote them. The study will focus particularly on whether worker ownership fits well with the needs of workers from historically disadvantaged groups.

We’re human beings first. We operate with empathy and kindness – with our clients, with our collaborators, and with ourselves.
People deserve better than status quo. We’re willing to tackle the intractable problems, no matter how big, because someone should. We ask big questions, we craft big solutions, and we challenge ourselves and others to make it happen.
No bystanders. No stars. No tourists. Each person has been selected to be here, and with that comes a responsibility to bring your expertise, share your ideas, and help make this company better.
Partnership paves the path ahead. We don’t operate in a silo, internally or externally. To transform the system, we believe in working with others to create something bigger, better, and stronger.
Quality is crucial at scale. Quality is core to our business, and we refuse to sacrifice it as we grow.
Progress is a process. In the pursuit of progress, we iterate, reflect, learn, adjust – and always leave things better than we found them.
There are people behind every data point. We recognize that numbers tell only one part of the story, and we also do the work to understand impacts at the individual level

Compensation:

Octave is committed to pay equity. To maintain our commitment to pay equity, Octave will follow Pay Transparency regulations on all open job postings. Current Pay Transparency laws require companies to include a position's salary or hourly wage range (not including bonuses or equity-based compensation) in any internal or external job posting. This requirement extends to job postings published by a third party at an employer's request.

Octave will not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against employees or applicants because they have inquired about, discussed, or disclosed their own pay or the pay of another employee or applicant. However, employees who have access to the compensation information of other employees or applicants as a part of their essential job functions cannot disclose the pay of other employees or applicants to individuals who do not otherwise have access to compensation information, unless the disclosure is (a) in response to a formal complaint or charge, (b) in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by the employer, or (c) consistent with Octave’s legal duty to furnish information.

Starting pay for qualified applicants will depend on a combination of job-related factors, which may include education, training, experience, location, business needs, or market demands. The expected salary range for this role is set forth below and this range may be modified in the future.

The salary range is for zone 1 (all states not in zone 2 or zone 3) $132,100 - $142,600.

The salary range for zone 2 (CO, HI, MD, RI) is $145,300 - $156,900.

The salary range for zone 3 (AK, CA, CT, MA, NJ, NY, WA) is $152,000 - $164,000.

All zones are eligible for equity in the form of stock options.

Additionally, this position is eligible for the following benefits: company sponsored life insurance, disability and AD&D plans. Voluntary benefits such as 401k retirement, medical, dental, vision, FSA, HSA, dependent care and commuter/parking options are also available. Octave offers generous Paid Time Off as well as paid parental leave benefits.

This job description is not designed to cover or contain a comprehensive listing of activities, duties or responsibilities that are required of the employee for this job. Duties, responsibilities and activities may change at any time with or without notice.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It’s where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you’ll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You’ll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Creating a life you love also means finding a career that celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences that you bring. As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

The Sales Strategy & Operations (SS&O) team partners with advertising sales leaders across sales strategy and analytics, operations and process and tools. Team members are experts in business strategy and operations and analytical and strategic thinking. They are pragmatic and results-oriented. As a Business Intelligence Analyst, you will focus on empowering sales leadership and the broader sales organization with self-serve access to data and insights. You’ll be responsible for designing, building and maintaining scaled sales analytics solutions (dashboards, data tables) for over one thousand internal users.

What You’ll Do


Collaborate with SS&O team members and sales leaders to define key business metrics and gather requirements for which insights should be made available at scale. Architect data pipelines, design and build new Tableau dashboards for stakeholders to use to address their needs. Maintain and improve existing sales data infrastructure and Tableau dashboards based on evolving business requirements.
Democratize sales data by enabling self-serve access to key business drivers, trends and operating metrics. Design fully automated dashboards that are easy to understand, enable self-serve access for the sales org, and can be used by a broad audience with a variety of use cases.
Publish and maintain clear documentation to inform and educate users at scale, gather feedback to identify opportunities for improvement.
Identify ways to streamline and improve the efficiency of our data. Implement changes to our infrastructure (optimize SQL queries and data workflows) to improve the landing time of our data.
Work with cross-functional teams including Sales, Strategic Finance, and Business Intelligence to identify data needs and gaps, and align on solutions.
Lead projects end to end, see around corners and provide thought partnership to your team.



What We’re Looking For


3+ years of professional experience in highly analytical environments such as management consulting, investment banking, corporate strategy or technology/media companies.
Understanding of sales and digital advertising platforms and working knowledge of sales systems and tools (Salesforce).
Strong data analytics and business intelligence skills - querying large data sets with advanced SQL, building visualizations with Tableau. Experience building and maintaining data pipelines (authoring, scheduling, monitoring workflows).
Ability to visualize complex data sets that provide insights and clearly inform areas of action.
Passion for building new solutions and enabling analysis at scale to drive decision-making.
Experience in a complex, fast-paced environment.
Organized, detail-oriented and strategically focused.
Strong written and verbal communication skills.
Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as business administration, or equivalent experience.



Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement


We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.
This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 1-2 times/month and therefore needs to be in a commutable distance from the NY office.



At Pinterest we believe the workplace should be equitable, inclusive, and inspiring for every employee. In an effort to provide greater transparency, we are sharing the base salary range for this position. The position is also eligible for equity. Final salary is based on a number of factors including location, travel, relevant prior experience, or particular skills and expertise.

Jsme Investown, česká crowdfundingová platforma, a naším cílem je zpřístupnit vyšší výnosy z nemovitostí jednoduše a každému. Rosteme, a tím nám velmi rychle přibývá počet úkolů a dat, která je potřeba zpracovat. Hledáme k nám Performance Data Analytika. Někoho, kdo má zkušenost s datovou analýzou, umí SQL a poradí si s různými datovými nástroji.




🔵 Jak bude vypadat tvá práce

Sledování klíčových metrik výkonnosti (KPI) a reporting pro interní stakeholdery.
Identifikace trendů a příležitostí na základě historických dat a tržních analýz.
Podpora strategického rozhodování prostřednictvím datových analýz a doporučení.

Vytváření a správa datových modelů pro predikci výnosnosti a rizik.

🔵 S kým budeš nejčastěji spolupracovat

Hlavně s produktovým a marketingovým týmem.
Potkávat se taky budeš s týmem risk managementu a úvěrových analytiků.
Čeká tě spolupráce s externími “dataři” na automatizaci a vizualizaci dat pomocí BI nástrojů.




🔵 Jak si tě představujeme

Zkušenosti s analýzou dat, business intelligence nebo finanční analýzou.
Schopnost pracovat s datovými nástroji jako SQL, Power BI nebo Python (nice to have).
Znalost práce s databázemi a schopnost vytvářet sofistikované reporty.
Analytické a kritické myšlení, schopnosti interpretovat složité datové sady.
Výhodou je zkušenosti z oblasti investic, financí nebo realitního trhu.
Nehledáme někoho, kdo působil na rolích Data Engineer nebo Architect. Řešení už navržené máme, proto hledáme spíš někoho na roli Data Scientist.




🔵 Co ti nabídneme

Práci v odvětví crowdfundingového úvěrování ve firmě, kde má každý možnost ovlivnit její směr.
Premium 4 členství na naší platformě, aby se ti investice ještě více zhodnotily.
Kanceláře ve Foru Karlín, které jsou dog-friendly a mají vlastní kávový bar. Dáš si tak super espresso, flat white. Pro nadšence tu máme i Moccamaster. ☕️
Budget na osobní rozvoj, aby ses mohl/a posouvat dál.
Plně hrazenou Multisportku. 💪
Vždycky můžeš doplnit energii v našem office snack baru. 🍎
Stejně jako všichni u nás budeš mít maximální prostor pro seberealizaci. Chceme tvou iniciativu a nápady.
Čekají tě také pravidelné měsíční Product&Dev Meetups, kdy si rádi zajdeme na bowling, únikovku nebo jakoukoliv jinou aktivitu!




Tak co, potkáme se na pohovoru? 👋

What’s next:

If you’re excited about this opportunity, send your information to hello@royaltyport.com. Sharing previous work, if applicable, is highly encouraged. The first step is an initial online meeting. We might ask you to do a technical test, depending on your level of experience.

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have an absolute love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem, and living inside a spreadsheet/data set to find the answer to any question.
Because you love data, you have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis. Experience with Marketing APIs, Big Query or other Cloud Data Warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.), ETL Tools (Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics) and/or Python are all pluses.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and have spent a minimum of 1 year working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.




What You’ll Do:

Reporting: With your expertise in Advanced Excel, SQL, Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools, you’ll be maintaining customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence, generating pivot tables and other visualizations that summarize thousands of lines of data. You should have experience in translating performance media metrics into coherent, digestible reports for client ad campaigns and be comfortable communicating via Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.
Strategy: You’ll be responsible for learning our clients’ businesses and aligning their media strategy with business goals as well as understanding advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to help guide media buying strategy. With a background in paid media and/or digital advertising, you understand concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue and are able to be engaged in discussions with clients to gain trust and shareholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.

Tier 1 Investment Firm

Boston - Hybrid (3/2)

FTE




Our leading investment client is looking for a skilled Data Analyst to join a dynamic and growing data and engineering team, supporting a broad range of investment strategies. This role involves designing and developing critical technology assets, leveraging cloud-based solutions to build scalable data pipelines and storage architectures. The ideal candidate will have a strong technical foundation in Python, SQL, dbt, and cloud platforms (preferably AWS), along with experience in data visualization tools like Streamlit, Plotly, Power BI, or Tableau. This is a unique opportunity to contribute to an early-stage data environment within an investment firm that operates across diverse asset classes, including commodities, fixed income, equities, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies.




As part of a highly collaborative and fast-moving team, the Data Analyst will be responsible for sourcing, structuring, and analyzing complex datasets—both structured and unstructured—to support investment decision-making. The role requires proficiency in relational databases (PostgreSQL preferred), data pipeline management, and software development lifecycle best practices. Hands-on experience with Git, CI/CD processes, Airflow, and Docker is a plus. Additionally, a familiarity with web scraping technologies and Kimball/Star schema data warehousing design would be advantageous. Candidates should demonstrate an ability to think critically, solve problems independently, and adapt quickly to evolving priorities.




This position offers a high level of exposure to experienced investors and portfolio managers, with projects executed in small cross-functional teams. The ideal candidate is not only technically proficient but also able to translate business needs into technical solutions and effectively communicate with non-technical stakeholders. Prior experience in Financial Services, Economics, or Accounting is a plus but not required. A strong analytical mindset, keen attention to detail, and a passion for leveraging data to drive investment insights are essential qualities for success in this role.




Candidates should have a BS or MS degree in Computer Science (or a related field) and 2–5 years of experience developing software applications. A demonstrated ability to learn new technologies and tools—such as GitHub Copilot or AI-driven development platforms—is highly desirable. This role is ideal for a self-motivated problem solver who thrives in a collaborative, high-impact environment and is eager to work on complex challenges at the intersection of data, finance, and technology.

At CarGurus (NASDAQ: CARG), our mission is to give people the power to reach their destination. We started as a small team of developers determined to bring trust and transparency to car shopping. Since then, our history of innovation and go-to-market acceleration has driven industry-leading growth. In fact, we’re the largest and fastest-growing automotive marketplace, and we’ve been profitable for over 15 years.

What We Do

The market is evolving, and we are too, moving the entire automotive journey online and guiding our customers through every step. That includes everything from the sale of an old car to the financing, purchase, and delivery of a new one. Today, tens of millions of consumers visit CarGurus.com each month, and ~30,000 dealerships use our products. But they're not the only ones who love CarGurus—our employees do, too. We have a people-first culture that fosters kindness, collaboration, and innovation, and empowers our Gurus with tools to fuel their career growth. Disrupting a trillion-dollar industry requires fresh and diverse perspectives. Come join us for the ride!

Role Overview

We are looking for a Product Data Analyst to join our Consumer team which tackles a complex data environment, building out data assets, running experiments, and many more unstructured analytics tasks to support the core listings business.

Our Product Data Analytics org as a whole supports our Product and Engineering teams, providing the final word on all analytics for CarGurus’ user and dealer experiences. We are looking for thoughtful, curious, internally driven candidates who can dive into complex data and draw novel, insightful conclusions.

What You’ll Do


Using your SQL expertise, conduct exploratory empirical analyses that bridge disparate data sources (e.g. website usage, subscription records, inventory volumes, etc.) to quantify product performance, user behavior, and/or market trends. Doing so will require distilling unstructured “big data” into actionable insights.
Creatively compress sweeping, high-level exploratory requests into specific calculations that address your stakeholders’ underlying needs.
Relentlessly dig into the data – consulting with other individuals and teams as you judge necessary – beyond the letter of the initial assignment, to hammer out any anomalies or self-direct your inquiry into other relevant issues.
Be comfortable escalating and automating your analyses using R/Python scripting.
Be the authority on A/B experimentation, advising engineers and product managers on everything from the necessary data points to collect, required sample sizes, optimal metrics to examine, robustness of numerical findings, and the bottom-line success or failure of the tested changes.
Provide technical guidance on and ideas for improving A/B testing-related tools, algorithms, and automated processes.
Conduct self-directed research on the latest trends in A/B experimentation, and map out internal improvements based on your findings.
Advocate for specific, data-driven product innovations that help further high-level company strategy, primarily in partnership with the Product/Engineering teams.
Participate in brainstorming and planning discussions across the organization to these ends.
Avoid passivity in the face of flawed proposals; tactfully and persuasively push back against potential missteps.
Craft the metrics that define business success, condensing abstract or loosely-defined concepts down to concrete calculations.
Audit and improve existing metrics to better inform the business’ needs.
Build intuitive dashboards and other visual monitoring tools to guide daily decision-making by senior stakeholders and the company at large.
Experiment with new kinds of visualizations that you believe could be better utilized in the organization.
Re-work underlying code to appropriately structure visualization inputs.
Communicate and present complex quantitative findings in easily digestible terms to company leadership, homing in on key takeaways.
Concretely and informatively respond to any probing, on-the-spot follow-up questions from senior decision-makers.
Conceive of new data assets and build automated transformations (via DBT, LookML, etc.) to bring them to fruition.
Partner with Data Engineering teams to advance core data modeling/architecture (e.g. user clickstream logging), by optimizing, integrating, and distilling large raw datasets and metadata.
Draw upon prior experience with expansive, unrefined datasets to fix modeling bottlenecks in quick, scalable, outside-of-the-box ways.


What You’ll Bring


2+ years of experience in an analytics or analytics-adjacent field, ideally involving complex data modeling, quantitative analysis, and applied statistics.
Expert fluency in SQL. Experience with statistical programming (R, Stata, SAS, Python) is desirable.
Working understanding of core statistical concepts (regression, significance testing, omitted variable bias, independence/dependence, etc.).
Knack for creative data visualizations.
Willingness to step outside your role and independently come up with novel ideas for the business.
Willingness to challenge others’ ideas and advocate for your own.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Very comfortable presenting high-impact and potentially sensitive findings to senior leadership.
Strong project planning skills, with experience building roadmaps, estimating required resources, and flagging inter-dependencies with other teams/projects.
Preferred tools/programs: Snowflake, Snowplow, DBT, Looker, Jira, Salesforce, Google/MS suite

Bain Capital Overview

With approximately $185 billion of assets under management, Bain Capital is one of the world’s leading private investment firms. We create lasting impact for our investors, teams, businesses, and the communities in which we live. Over four decades we have strategically grown our platform to focus on Private Equity, Growth & Venture, Capital Solutions, Credit & Capital Markets, and Real Assets. Today, our team includes 1,880+ employees in 24 offices on four continents.

We partner differently to help people and companies embrace possibility and realize potential. Founded as a private partnership in 1984, we have fostered a culture of innovation, entrepreneurialism, and agility, empowering our people to define and own their career trajectories. Today, our partnership approach enables us to pursue strategic growth, build enduring relationships with a robust external network, and collaborate across our integrated platform to connect the deep and diverse expertise that unlocks breakthrough insights.

Our people are the heart of our advantage. Colleagues at all levels have a seat at the table as they tackle business challenges with a principal investor mindset. By asking incisive questions, respectfully challenging one another, and remaining intellectually agile, we work together to achieve exceptional outcomes.

Bain Capital Partnership Strategies:

Bain Capital Partnership Strategies was formed in 2005, initially to find investments for the personal capital of Bain Capital’s partners. Our Boston-based team combines rigorous fundamental research, deep experience across asset classes, and a global perspective to make unique investments that are not widely available. Partnership Strategies began accepting external capital in 2018 and currently manages ~$2.5 billion of assets on behalf of a diverse set of LPs.

The Partnership Strategies Fund (PSF) is a multi-strategy hedge fund with a differentiated investment approach. The Fund utilizes off-market sourcing, detailed underwriting, and a long-term time horizon to create a diversified portfolio of hard-to-access investments that generate returns uncorrelated to equity markets.

Position Description:

The Partnership Strategies’ data and engineering team, which currently consists of a Data Analyst, BI Developer, Data Architect, and Development Director, is growing, and we are looking for a motivated, independent, and well-rounded data analyst with strong problem-solving skills to join this high performing team. This position will support a range of investment strategies that rely on our ability to rapidly source and analyze complex datasets. This role provides a unique opportunity to design and build foundational tools in an early-stage, rapidly growing data environment.

Responsibilities include technical design, development, support, and maintenance of strategic technology assets that are critical to the business’ success. Core to the position will be utilizing Cloud services to build scalable and efficient data pipelines and storage solutions, as well as the ability to analyze, interpret, and present complex data sets, both structured and unstructured, in a manner that is consumable by the investment teams to support business decision-making.

This position is an opportunity to work closely with, and learn from, seasoned investors that have decades of experience investing globally. Projects are run in small pods with cross functional expertise and collaboration of portfolio manager(s), research analysts, and engineers/developers. This is a dynamic and fast-moving team that has a flexible mandate to invest in a broad variety of markets including commodities, public equities, fixed income, environmental markets, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies. Given this broad scope, the data analyst must demonstrate independent problem-solving skills, the ability to tackle complex challenges, and the flexibility to adapt quickly to shifting priorities and projects.

Technology Experience:


Proficiency in Python, SQL, and dbt, with demonstrated ability to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code
Experience with Airflow and Docker is a plus
Experience with cloud platforms is required (preferably AWS)
Hands-on experience with reporting, self-service dashboard technologies, and data visualization tools such as Streamlit, Plotly, Power BI, or Tableau
Experience with relational databases (preferably PostgreSQL)
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines and transformations
Knowledge of software development lifecycle
Experience with and understanding of source control (Git) and CI/CD processes
Proficient with current web scraping technologies
Familiarity with Kimball / Star schema data warehousing design is a plus
Familiarity with web and/or front-end development technologies (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.JS) is a plus
Experience with GitHub Copilot or other AI development productivity tool(s) preferred


Qualifications:


BS or MS degree in Computer Science or equivalent technical training and professional work experience
2-5 years of professional experience developing software applications
Must possess excellent verbal and written communication skills; ability to articulate technology concepts to non-technical stakeholders and ability to translate business needs and desired goals into technical requirements
Prior professional experience in the Financial Services industry or demonstrated interest in Finance, Economics, and/or Accounting is preferred, but not required
Strong analytical and technical problem-solving skills with an attention to detail
An interest in emerging technologies and a proven record of ability to pick up new platforms, techniques, and programming languages
Takes ownership and pride in end-to-end delivery of projects and initiatives eager to continue learning and excited to tackle complex problems
Reliable and collaborative team member
Motivated self-starter capable of managing multiple assignments, prioritizing tasks effectively and the ability to work independently
