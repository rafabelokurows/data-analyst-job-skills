With privacy at heart, we always make sure to only collect the absolute minimum of data. Everything happening on our partner’s websites is anonymized, rigorously sampled, and free of any user-identifiable information.

Responsibilities:

Analyze: Deep dive into business, traffic and behavioral data to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for improvement.

Qualifications:

Seniority: At least 5 years of experience in similar roles is a must.
Analytical mindset: Strong analytical skills with the ability to extract meaningful insights from large-scale, anonymized datasets.
Technical proficiency: Deep knowledge of data analysis and manipulation languages (e.g. SQL, R or Python), data visualization tools (e.g. Looker Studio or Grafana), as well as data platforms (e.g. BigQuery, ClickHouse, or Snowflake)
Predictive Analytics: Hands-on experience with statistical modeling and advanced analytics techniques.
Growth hacking mentality: A passion for user acquisition, engagement, and retention, with a proactive approach to identifying growth opportunities. 
Communication skills: Excellent written and verbal communication skills (English) with the ability to present complex information in a clear and concise manner.
Startup spirit: A self-starter with a strong work ethic, a can-do attitude, and a willingness to roll up your sleeves and get things done. Always eager to learn.




Bonus points:

Entrepreneurial or Web-Developer experience 
Familiarity with subscription business models and digital content monetization strategies.
Background in online publishing or media.




Benefits:

Impact: Make a real difference in a fast-growing startup and shape the future of digital publishing.
Growth: Accelerate your career by working directly with experienced founders and taking on significant responsibilities in a fast growing company.
Learning: Continuously expand your knowledge and skills in a dynamic and innovative environment.

Culture: Be part of a passionate and supportive team that values collaboration and open communication.
Ownership: Besides a competitive salary we also offer equity

Über uns



Als Beauty-Onlineshop bringen wir deine liebsten Produkte kuratierter Marken aus den USA, UK & Co. nach Deutschland und sehen uns dabei auch als Sprungbrett für kleine, noch wachsende Beauty-Brands.

Denn neben unserer Präsenz als Beauty-Onlineshop arbeiten wir hinter den Kulissen auch als Distributor für innovative Marken aus dem Ausland. Dazu gehören Geek & Gorgeous, RevitaLash und The Fox Tan, denen wir neue Zugänge zu bekannten Retailern in Europa eröffnen.

Dabei legen wir mit unserem diversen, jungen Team aus rund 50 Mitarbeitenden den Fokus auf ganzheitliche Marketingkonzepte, um Tag für Tag das Beauty-Game in der DACH-Region weiter zu revolutionieren. Das macht unsere Arbeit weltweit einzigartig und besonders abwechslungsreich.

Die PURISH GmbH fördert aktiv eine Kultur der Wertschätzung von Vielfalt. Daher begrüßen wir Bewerbungen von People of Color, Menschen aller Nationalitäten, Religionen und Weltanschauungen, sexueller Orientierungen und geschlechtlicher Identitäten sowie aller Altersgruppen und möglichen Einschränkungen.

Wir ermutigen alle, sich bei uns zu bewerben!

Correlate marketing/product/commercial data to derive key insights
Work with our data engineering/business intelligence teams to build data models, which best summarise and utilise our production data
Act as an advocate of our company’s data-driven culture: produce reports that are actionable, dashboards that are diagnostic, and recommendations that drive growth

Du nutzt vorhandene Daten, um Vorhersagen zu möglichen Kampagnen-Ergebnissen zu treffen.

Du baust eine neue Datenstruktur auf, die alle notwendigen Standard-Reportings enthält – gemeinsam mit dem Team legst du fest, wie maximale Transparenz und Sichtbarkeit erreicht werden können.

Du identifizierst Geschäftsmöglichkeiten: Sei es durch das Erkennen von Marketing- und Kampagnentrends, die Verbesserung interner Prozesse oder durch den Einsatz datengetriebener Plattformen, die Vertriebsaktivitäten transparenter machen

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$181,700. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$181,700. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Chainlink Labs is the primary contributing developer of Chainlink, the decentralized computing platform powering the verifiable web. Chainlink is the industry-standard platform for providing access to real-world data, offchain computation, and secure cross-chain interoperability across any blockchain. Chainlink Labs helps power verifiable applications for banking, DeFi, global trade, and gaming by collaborating with some of the world’s largest financial institutions, notably Swift, DTCC, and ANZ. Chainlink Labs also works with top Web3 teams, including Aave, Compound, GMX, Maker, and Synthetix. Chainlink Labs was ranked in Newsweek’s 100 Most Loved Workplaces 2023 in both the United States and United Kingdom.

Chainlink Labs is pioneering the world’s first fully sustainable and decentralized oracle network, and the Economics team is searching for a Senior Analyst to play a critical role in building it. This role will sit at the intersection of blockchain technology, financial innovation, and economic systems, and shape the future of decentralized economics.

As a Senior Analyst, you will combine economics, data science, and blockchain expertise to shape incentives, optimize network design, and influence the decision-making of our Economics and Executive Leadership teams. You will design, analyze, and operationalize economic models for production applications. You will collaborate across departments to bring innovative solutions from concept to production, ensuring economic soundness and scalability throughout.

This is a high-impact role, offering visibility and influence as you contribute to the development of the Chainlink network. If you’re a meticulous, creative, and motivated individual ready to solve complex economic problems through data-driven decisions in the rapidly evolving world of Web3, this is the role for you.

Your Impact

You'll work on a wide array of blockchain economics projects, analyses, and systems, including:
Designing novel mechanisms and incentive schemes
Building models and simulations to evaluate investment opportunities
Designing and parameterizing trading systems
Optimizing parameters for production applications
Contributing to the design of Economics programs and applications
You'll optimize network incentives and systems by engaging directly with the Economics, Product, Engineering, Research, and Data Science teams to understand network dynamics at the deepest level.
You'll operationalize processes and analytics systems, and coordinate cross-functionally to implement them.
This is both a highly technical and highly social role. You will have high visibility and a large impact on how Chainlink builds the world’s first fully sustainable decentralized oracle network.

Requirements


5+ years experience in a quantitative role, particularly trading or quant research
A deep understanding of financial and crypto markets and incentives
Extensive financial modeling background, including data engineering and model automation
Strong SQL and Python skills are mandatory
Experience solving economic problems through statistical/econometric analyses
Substantial data analysis and/or data science experience
Meticulous attention to detail.


Preferred Qualifications


Strong Economics and/or Finance background through Masters-level academics and/or multiple years of industry experience.
Strong organizational and coordination skills necessary to productionize/operationalize processes and applications.
Preferably smart contract programming experience (Rust, Go, Solidity), but familiarity with smart contract code and dApp architecture at a minimum
Published research with an economics or crypto focus (e.g., papers on MEV or PBS, staking and slashing dynamics, node compensation, tokenomics, etc.)


All roles with Chainlink Labs are global and remote-based. Unless otherwise stated, we ask that you try to overlap some working hours with Eastern Standard Time (EST).

Our Purpose

At Deloitte, we are driven to inspire and help our people, organization, communities, and country to thrive. Our Purpose is to build a better future by accelerating and expanding access to knowledge. Purpose defines who we are and gives us reason to exist as an organization.

By living our Purpose, we will make an impact that matters.





What will your typical day look like?

This is an exciting time to be part of the Industry Program team. You’ll collaborate with peers and leaders on a series of high-impact internal projects related to Deloitte’s industry strategy. From go-to-market campaigns and strategy development (e.g., how can we bring deeper industry expertise to our clients?), to reporting and analytics (e.g., where should we focus to improve financial performance?), to communities of practice and governance (e.g., how do share best practices across teams?)—no day will be the same. You’ll be constantly learning, making an impact, and connecting with a great team.

About The Team

Our mandate is to enable growth by delivering marketplace strategies to address the biggest challenges our clients face. While the Industry Program team does not work directly with clients, we drive the programs that underpin Deloitte’s ability to serve clients with excellence and distinction.

Strong analytical skills: You can break down an ambiguous problem into component parts and plan out a strategic approach to tackle them
Effective communication: You can translate complex concepts into digestible written, verbal, or visual messages (emails, presentations, reports)
Organizational prowess: You thrive in an environment of competing deadlines and concurrent projects—while maintaining a keen attention to detail
Appetite for initiative: You are excited to put up your hand, get involved, and get things done—sometimes with limited supervision and guidance
Team player: You love to collaborate with others to solve problems, share knowledge, and succeed together
Technical skills: You get excited about a well-designed Excel or PowerPoint, and you’re comfortable using them to run an analysis or present a compelling narrative
To be eligible for this role, you must be graduating in December 2025 or later

Our promise to our people: Deloitte is where potential comes to life

Be yourself, and more.

We are a group of talented people who want to learn, gain experience, and develop skills. Wherever you are in your career, we want you to advance.

Job Summary

The Evaluation Analyst will report to the Evaluation Manager. They will collaborate with the Data Intelligence and Reporting Analyst, Evaluation Specialists, and Evaluation Associates on key tasks and deliverables that support their projects. They will also interact with faculty and staff from the FoM and attend and participate in committees, working groups and planning meetings as assigned.

Our Purpose

At Deloitte, we are driven to inspire and help our people, organization, communities, and country to thrive. Our Purpose is to build a better future by accelerating and expanding access to knowledge. Purpose defines who we are and gives us reason to exist as an organization.

By living our Purpose, we will make an impact that matters.





What will your typical day look like?

This is an exciting time to be part of the Industry Program team. You’ll collaborate with peers and leaders on a series of high-impact internal projects related to Deloitte’s industry strategy. From go-to-market campaigns and strategy development (e.g., how can we bring deeper industry expertise to our clients?), to reporting and analytics (e.g., where should we focus to improve financial performance?), to communities of practice and governance (e.g., how do share best practices across teams?)—no day will be the same. You’ll be constantly learning, making an impact, and connecting with a great team.

About The Team

Our mandate is to enable growth by delivering marketplace strategies to address the biggest challenges our clients face. While the Industry Program team does not work directly with clients, we drive the programs that underpin Deloitte’s ability to serve clients with excellence and distinction. Our industry focus spans a broad scope, from financial services and energy to public sector and technology, and more. As a member of the team, you will be exposed to industry and business leadership and decisions that shape Deloitte’s strategic direction.

Enough about us, let’s talk about you

In this role, the expected qualifications are:


Strong analytical skills: You can break down an ambiguous problem into component parts and plan out a strategic approach to tackle them
Effective communication: You can translate complex concepts into digestible written, verbal, or visual messages (emails, presentations, reports)
Organizational prowess: You thrive in an environment of competing deadlines and concurrent projects—while maintaining a keen attention to detail
Appetite for initiative: You are excited to put up your hand, get involved, and get things done—sometimes with limited supervision and guidance
Team player: You love to collaborate with others to solve problems, share knowledge, and succeed together
Technical skills: You get excited about a well-designed Excel or PowerPoint, and you’re comfortable using them to run an analysis or present a compelling narrative
To be eligible for this role, you must be graduating in December 2025 or later


Total Rewards

The salary range for this position is $48,500.00 - $55,000.00, and individuals may be eligible to participate in our bonus program. Deloitte is fair and competitive when it comes to the salaries of our people. We regularly benchmark across a variety of positions, industries, sectors, targets, and levels. Our approach is grounded on recognizing people's unique strengths and contributions and rewarding the value that they deliver.

Our Total Rewards Package extends well beyond traditional compensation and benefit programs and is designed to recognize employee contributions, encourage personal wellness, and support firm growth. Along with a competitive base salary and variable pay opportunities, we offer a wide array of initiatives that differentiate us as a people-first organization. Some representative examples include: $4,000 per year for mental health support benefits, a $1,300 flexible benefit spending account, 38+ days off (including 10 firm-wide closures known as ""Deloitte Days""), flexible work arrangements and a hybrid work structure.

Our promise to our people: Deloitte is where potential comes to life

Be yourself, and more.

We are a group of talented people who want to learn, gain experience, and develop skills. Wherever you are in your career, we want you to advance.

You Shape How We Make Impact.

Diverse perspectives and life experiences make us better. Whoever you are and wherever you’re from, we want you to feel like you belong here. We provide flexible working options to support you and how you can contribute.

Be the leader you want to be.

Some guide teams, some change culture, some build essential expertise. We offer opportunities and experiences that support your continuing growth as a leader.

Have as many careers as you want.

We are uniquely able to offer you new challenges and roles – and prepare you for them. We bring together people with unique experiences and talents, and we are the place to develop a lasting network of friends, peers, and mentors.

The next step is yours

Apply by March 2, 2025 at 11:59 P.M.

We’ve designed these standards to provide our clients with a consistent and exceptional Deloitte experience globally. Deloitte Canada has 20 offices with representation across most of the country. We acknowledge that Deloitte offices stand on traditional, treaty, and unceded
