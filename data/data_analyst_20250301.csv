What You’ll Do


Collaborate with SS&O team members and sales leaders to define key business metrics and gather requirements for which insights should be made available at scale. Architect data pipelines, design and build new Tableau dashboards for stakeholders to use to address their needs. Maintain and improve existing sales data infrastructure and Tableau dashboards based on evolving business requirements.

Lead projects end to end, see around corners and provide thought partnership to your team.



What We’re Looking For


3+ years of professional experience in highly analytical environments such as management consulting, investment banking, corporate strategy or technology/media companies.
Understanding of sales and digital advertising platforms and working knowledge of sales systems and tools (Salesforce).
Strong data analytics and business intelligence skills - querying large data sets with advanced SQL, building visualizations with Tableau. Experience building and maintaining data pipelines (authoring, scheduling, monitoring workflows).
Ability to visualize complex data sets that provide insights and clearly inform areas of action.
Passion for building new solutions and enabling analysis at scale to drive decision-making.
Experience in a complex, fast-paced environment.
Organized, detail-oriented and strategically focused.

Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement


We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.
This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 1-2 times/month and therefore needs to be in a commutable distance from the NY office.



At Pinterest we believe the workplace should be equitable, inclusive, and inspiring for every employee.

What We Offer

Our goal is to competitively and fairly compensate every Semgrep employee with a system that equally rewards those who are vocal and those who are less comfortable making demands during the final steps of the hiring process.

Semgrep is an equal-opportunity employer seeking a diverse range of backgrounds. We value who you are — including your cultural heritage, your socioeconomic status, your age, your race, your gender, your sexual orientation, your disabilities. We value what’s vitally important to you — your family, your religion, your politics. We value what you love in this world — your music, your weekend pursuits. We believe in welcoming varied professional backgrounds, educations, and interests.

Quality is crucial at scale. Quality is core to our business, and we refuse to sacrifice it as we grow.
Progress is a process. In the pursuit of progress, we iterate, reflect, learn, adjust – and always leave things better than we found them.
