What You’ll Do


Collaborate with SS&O team members and sales leaders to define key business metrics and gather requirements for which insights should be made available at scale. Architect data pipelines, design and build new Tableau dashboards for stakeholders to use to address their needs. Maintain and improve existing sales data infrastructure and Tableau dashboards based on evolving business requirements.
Democratize sales data by enabling self-serve access to key business drivers, trends and operating metrics. Design fully automated dashboards that are easy to understand, enable self-serve access for the sales org, and can be used by a broad audience with a variety of use cases.
Publish and maintain clear documentation to inform and educate users at scale, gather feedback to identify opportunities for improvement.

Work with cross-functional teams including Sales, Strategic Finance, and Business Intelligence to identify data needs and gaps, and align on solutions.
Lead projects end to end, see around corners and provide thought partnership to your team.



What We’re Looking For


3+ years of professional experience in highly analytical environments such as management consulting, investment banking, corporate strategy or technology/media companies.
Understanding of sales and digital advertising platforms and working knowledge of sales systems and tools (Salesforce).
Strong data analytics and business intelligence skills - querying large data sets with advanced SQL, building visualizations with Tableau. Experience building and maintaining data pipelines (authoring, scheduling, monitoring workflows).
Ability to visualize complex data sets that provide insights and clearly inform areas of action.
Passion for building new solutions and enabling analysis at scale to drive decision-making.
Experience in a complex, fast-paced environment.
Organized, detail-oriented and strategically focused.

Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as business administration, or equivalent experience.



Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement


We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.
This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 1-2 times/month and therefore needs to be in a commutable distance from the NY office.



At Pinterest we believe the workplace should be equitable, inclusive, and inspiring for every employee.

Additional Information

Early morning. Campo 24 de Agosto. In 4 minutes, you are clocking in at the office. After grabbing a cup of coffee and fresh fruit, pick up your laptop and choose your spot for the day. It's going to be a busy one: French class before lunch and, just after, quick medical appointment at Natixis doctor's office. Lunch break. Outside in the big terrace (look at your crops at the Urban Garden; ready to harvest!) or, if you feel like stretching your legs, walk downtown to grab lunch.

Back inside. Quick sprint review (working together anywhere means virtual happy birthday to that colleague in Paris that just turned 35). The afternoon went flying (tasks, reports, calls, some jokes with your teammates). End it on a high note: just one PlayStation game or the final match for that ping-pong tournament.

Tomorrow, you complete that certified technical training and the day after, you will work from home, taking advantage to finally do that online course on Udemy. Once you are done with your tasks for the day, you can visit the office for a board games session or show up at the rehearsal of one of Natixis bands. If that is too steady for you, meet your colleagues to surf some waves or join them in a football match.

At CarGurus (NASDAQ: CARG), our mission is to give people the power to reach their destination. We started as a small team of developers determined to bring trust and transparency to car shopping.

Role Overview

We are looking for a Product Data Analyst to join our Consumer team which tackles a complex data environment, building out data assets, running experiments, and many more unstructured analytics tasks to support the core listings business.

Our Product Data Analytics org as a whole supports our Product and Engineering teams, providing the final word on all analytics for CarGurus’ user and dealer experiences. We are looking for thoughtful, curious, internally driven candidates who can dive into complex data and draw novel, insightful conclusions.

What You’ll Do


Using your SQL expertise, conduct exploratory empirical analyses that bridge disparate data sources (e.g. website usage, subscription records, inventory volumes, etc.) to quantify product performance, user behavior, and/or market trends. Doing so will require distilling unstructured “big data” into actionable insights.
Creatively compress sweeping, high-level exploratory requests into specific calculations that address your stakeholders’ underlying needs.
Relentlessly dig into the data – consulting with other individuals and teams as you judge necessary – beyond the letter of the initial assignment, to hammer out any anomalies or self-direct your inquiry into other relevant issues.
Be comfortable escalating and automating your analyses using R/Python scripting.
Be the authority on A/B experimentation, advising engineers and product managers on everything from the necessary data points to collect, required sample sizes, optimal metrics to examine, robustness of numerical findings, and the bottom-line success or failure of the tested changes.
Provide technical guidance on and ideas for improving A/B testing-related tools, algorithms, and automated processes.
Conduct self-directed research on the latest trends in A/B experimentation, and map out internal improvements based on your findings.
Advocate for specific, data-driven product innovations that help further high-level company strategy, primarily in partnership with the Product/Engineering teams.
Participate in brainstorming and planning discussions across the organization to these ends.
Avoid passivity in the face of flawed proposals; tactfully and persuasively push back against potential missteps.
Craft the metrics that define business success, condensing abstract or loosely-defined concepts down to concrete calculations.
Audit and improve existing metrics to better inform the business’ needs.
Build intuitive dashboards and other visual monitoring tools to guide daily decision-making by senior stakeholders and the company at large.
Experiment with new kinds of visualizations that you believe could be better utilized in the organization.
Re-work underlying code to appropriately structure visualization inputs.
Communicate and present complex quantitative findings in easily digestible terms to company leadership, homing in on key takeaways.
Concretely and informatively respond to any probing, on-the-spot follow-up questions from senior decision-makers.
Conceive of new data assets and build automated transformations (via DBT, LookML, etc.) to bring them to fruition.
Partner with Data Engineering teams to advance core data modeling/architecture (e.g. user clickstream logging), by optimizing, integrating, and distilling large raw datasets and metadata.
Draw upon prior experience with expansive, unrefined datasets to fix modeling bottlenecks in quick, scalable, outside-of-the-box ways.


What You’ll Bring


2+ years of experience in an analytics or analytics-adjacent field, ideally involving complex data modeling, quantitative analysis, and applied statistics.
Expert fluency in SQL. Experience with statistical programming (R, Stata, SAS, Python) is desirable.
Working understanding of core statistical concepts (regression, significance testing, omitted variable bias, independence/dependence, etc.).
Knack for creative data visualizations.
Willingness to step outside your role and independently come up with novel ideas for the business.
Willingness to challenge others’ ideas and advocate for your own.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Very comfortable presenting high-impact and potentially sensitive findings to senior leadership.
Strong project planning skills, with experience building roadmaps, estimating required resources, and flagging inter-dependencies with other teams/projects.
Preferred tools/programs: Snowflake, Snowplow, DBT, Looker, Jira, Salesforce, Google/MS suite
