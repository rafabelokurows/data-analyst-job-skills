The PaCI team works to minimize the damage of inauthentic behaviors on TikTok platforms, covering multiple classical and novel community and business risk areas such as account integrity, engagement authenticity, anti-spam, API abuse, growth fraud, live streaming security and financial safety, etc. In this team, you'll have a unique opportunity to have first-hand exposure to the strategy of the company in key security initiatives, especially in building scalable and robust, intelligent and privacy-safe, secure, and product-friendly systems and solutions.

About TikTok U.S. Data Security

TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. U.S. Data Security (“USDS”) is a subsidiary of TikTok in the U.S. This new, security-first division was created to bring heightened focus and governance to our data protection policies and content assurance protocols to keep U.S. users safe. Our focus is on providing oversight and protection of the TikTok platform and U.S. user data, so millions of Americans can continue turning to TikTok to learn something new, earn a living, express themselves creatively, or be entertained. The teams within USDS that deliver on this commitment daily span across Trust & Safety, Security & Privacy, Engineering, User & Product Ops, Corporate Functions and more.

Why Join Us

Creation is the core of TikTok's purpose. Our platform is built to help imaginations thrive. This is doubly true of the teams that make TikTok possible.

Together, we inspire creativity and bring joy - a mission we all believe in and aim towards achieving every day.

To us, every challenge, no matter how difficult, is an opportunity; to learn, to innovate, and to grow as one team. Status quo? Never. Courage? Always.

At TikTok, we create together and grow together. That's how we drive impact - for ourselves, our company, and the communities we serve.

Join us.

The USDS-Platform and Community Integrity (PaCI) team is missioned to: - Protect U.S. TikTok users, including and beyond content consumers, creators, and advertisers; - Secure platform health and community experience authenticity; - Build infrastructures, platforms, and technologies, as well as to collaborate with many cross-functional teams and stakeholders. The PaCI team works to minimize the damage of inauthentic behaviors on TikTok platforms, covering multiple classical and novel community and business risk areas such as account integrity, engagement authenticity, anti-spam, API abuse, growth fraud, live streaming security and financial safety, etc. In this team, you'll have a unique opportunity to have first-hand exposure to the strategy of the company in key security initiatives, especially in building scalable and robust, intelligent and privacy-safe, secure, and product-friendly systems and solutions. Our challenges are not some regular day-to-day technical puzzles -- You'll be part of a team that's developing novel solutions to first-seen challenges of a non-stop evolution of a phenomenal product eco-system. The work needs to be fast, transferrable, while still down to the ground to make quick and solid differences.

In order to enhance collaboration and cross-functional partnerships, among other things, at this time, our organization follows a hybrid work schedule that requires employees to work in the office 3 days a week, or as directed by their manager/department. We regularly review our hybrid work model, and the specific requirements may change at any time.

Responsibilities

Build rules to recognize, mitigate or prevent risky inauthentic behaviors on TikTok and its extended platforms. Such risks include and are not limited to abusive accounts, fake engagements, spammy redirection, scraping, fraud, etc.

Analyze business, product and security data, uncover evolving attack motion, identify weaknesses and opportunities in risk defense solutions, explore new space from the discoveries.

Quantify risk control effects and trends, collaborate with engineering, modeling, operational and product colleagues, contribute to risk measurement, perception, mitigation and prevention with data stories.

Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications:

Bachelor or degrees above in computer science, statistics, math, internet security or other relevant majors (e.g., finance if applying for financial fraud roles)

Strong analytical skills. Proficiency in statistical analytical tools, such as SQL and Python.

Preferred Qualifications:

Familiarity with social/content online platform analytics. Bonus given to proficiency in data mining skills e.g. modern machine applications.

Ability to think critically, objectively, rationally. Reason and communicate in result-oriented, data-driven manner. High autonomy.

Candidates for this position must be legally authorized to work in the United States. This position is not eligible for visa sponsorship or support.

TikTok is committed to creating an inclusive space where employees are valued for their skills, experiences, and unique perspectives. Our platform connects people from across the globe and so does our workplace. At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. To achieve that goal, we are committed to celebrating our diverse voices and to creating an environment that reflects the many communities we reach. We are passionate about this and hope you are too.

TikTok is committed to providing reasonable accommodations in our recruitment processes for candidates with disabilities, pregnancy, sincerely held religious beliefs or other reasons protected by applicable laws. If you need assistance or a reasonable accommodation, please reach out to us at https://shorturl.at/ktJP6.

This role requires the ability to work with and support systems designed to protect sensitive data and information. As such, this role will be subject to strict national security-related screening.

Job Description

Your Career

What is a company’s “Attack Surface?” Attack Surface refers to all possible internet-facing access points that a bad actor can use to hack into a company’s system.

In this role, you will primarily focus on research analytics. This is a fantastic role if you are trying to break into the exciting field of cybersecurity! Each analyst is responsible for mapping out what parts of an organization are vulnerable and need to be tested for security vulnerabilities. Using various internal and external research techniques, Attack Surface Analysis analysts determine which internet-facing assets belong to a company of interest by investigating those assets' registration information, such as domains, certificates, and IP networks. The analysts focus on a specific company's profile (geographical location, company structure, company naming conventions, historical information, etc.) to narrow a broad scope of probable assets to those linked to the company of interest. A process we call ""attack surface discovery.""

We expect office-based employees to be in the office four days per week, with one day working from where they choose. We believe being together facilitates casual conversations and those magic moments where we can work on issues and ideas informally. These moments build capability and deepen trusted relationships and allow our people to feel safe in taking risks and being disruptive. Like so many companies, we are working through the details and things could change …. but in general if a role is deemed office-based we want our teams to be together four days per week.

Your Impact


Perform attack surface discovery on client internet-facing networks, thoroughly investigating thousands of possible assets and making informed ownership decisions
Partner with sales and customer success to answer technical client questions
Partner with sales to help explain and demonstrate the use cases of the software to customers
Partner closely with engineering teams on refining the attack surface discovery toolset we use
Review of technical documentation for training materials, technical marketing collateral, manuals, troubleshooting guides, etc.
Participation in on-call duty


Qualifications

Your Experience


Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Math or another technical discipline focused on problem-solving analysis or equivalent military experience required
2+ years of working experience
Conceptual understanding of technical topics (e.g. mathematical concepts)
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
Shown to have been results-driven and to have thrived in a fast-paced environment
Strong ability to operate with autonomy and independence in a remote setting
[preferred] Client-facing expertise within sales or customer success
[preferred] Experience with Excel (specifically the usage of more advanced features like macros, pivot tables, and v-lookups)

You are impact driven, love a challenge, and have a self-starter mindset
You're team-oriented, keen to share your knowledge and grow professionally

Wil jij je inzetten voor de Nederlandse vluchtelingensector? Vind jij het leuk om met veel verschillende stakeholders te schakelen en te werken aan een BI Competence Centre? Lees dan snel verder!




Dit ga je doen




Jouw taken als Data Analist bestaan uit:

Het zorgdragen voor de juiste implementatie van het BICC;
Het in kaart brengen van wensen uit de business;
Het meedenken over datamogelijkheden en waar nodig deze vertalen naar beleid en/of actiepunten;
Het schakelen met diverse stakeholders;
Actief meedenken over verbetermogelijkheden over de data-omgeving.




Hier ga je werken




Deze organisatie in Utrecht, waar jij als Data Analist komt te werken, vormt een onmisbaar onderdeel in de Nederlandse vluchtelingenopvang. Dag in dag uit werken de beste (zorg)professionals samen om vluchtelingen hulp te bieden.




De organisatie is momenteel druk bezig om een Business Intelligence Competence Center (BICC) op te zetten om als interne hub op het gebied van BI te acteren. Dit maakt het voor hen mogelijk om grote hoeveelheden data en processen op de juiste manier te centraliseren en daar de business optimaal te ondersteunen. Hier werken momenteel twee collega's, een kwartiermaker en een externe leverancier aan, maar kunnen hier nog extra ondersteuning in gebruiken.




Als BI Specialist zorg jij dat het BICC op de juiste wijze wordt opgeleverd. Je zorgt voor goede interne en externe communicatie rondom de data-ontwikkelingen. Jij vormt de brug tussen de business en het platform, waardoor je schakelt met stakeholders om wensen in kaart te brengen en deze te vertalen naar concrete BI-oplossingen. Daarnaast denk je actief mee hoe je met behulp van de beschikbare data de business optimaal kan ondersteunen. Samen met de IT Manager en Informatiemanager werk je aan het databeleid voor de komende jaren. Gezien dit een relatief nieuwe rol is, is er veel ruimte voor eigen initiatief en verantwoordelijkheid.




Je vervult een brugfunctie tussen IT en de organisatie en weet precies hoe je met data je doel kan bereiken, hopelijk ook gepaard met een gezonde dosis humor!




Dit doe je uiteraard niet alleen. Je werkt samen in het IT-team dat dagelijks verantwoordelijk is voor de strategie en operatie op IT-vlak en daarnaast kun je altijd terugvallen op je collega's binnen het BI domein.




Ben je enthousiast geworden over deze leuke uitdaging of wil je toch nog wat meer weten? Neem dan gerust telefonisch contact op óf stuur mij een berichtje via Whatsapp.




Dit neem je mee




Als Data Analist neem je tenminste mee:

Een achtergrond in Data Analyse of BI Development;
Ervaring met het in kaart brengen en verbeteren van processen is een pre;
Hbo werk/denkniveau;
Affiniteit met de zorg, overheid of de vluchtelingensector;
Communicatief vaardig met een pro-actieve houding;
Ervaring met stakeholdermanagement tot aan directieniveau.




Dit krijg je




De arbeidsvoorwaarden voor deze functie bestaan onder andere uit:

Vakantiegeld;
Reiskostenvergoeding;
13e maand;
Opleiding- en begeleidingmogelijkheden;
Thuiswerkmogelijkheden.

Project Description

This project examines the surge of corporate net-zero and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets to determine their effectiveness in achieving real emissions reductions, a critical step for meeting U.S. climate commitments. Led by a cross-disciplinary team supported by the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at University, the research analyses how corporate pledges influence behaviour, decision-making, and environmental outcomes. The team is investigating the actions corporations take in response to net-zero commitments, comparing the behaviour of companies with and without targets, and identifying gaps in implementation. By exploring the legal, regulatory, and business drivers behind these commitments, the project aims to uncover challenges, unintended consequences, and opportunities to strengthen corporate strategies and regulatory frameworks, ultimately driving meaningful emissions reductions.

Job Description

The primary responsibility of Research Assistants is to review and analyze firms’ sustainability reports, focusing on their carbon commitment statements, and transform this information into structured, high-quality data. This role involves:

Tracking and reading sustainability reports from various firms.

Analyzing qualitative content, including carbon commitment statements and other environmental goals.

Codifying qualitative data into structured datasets in Excel.

Ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the collected data to support the project’s empirical research.

The position requires close attention to detail, an ability to follow instructions precisely, and the discretion to exercise sound judgment when interpreting ambiguous or nuanced statements. Ideal candidates will excel in a role that demands both meticulousness and independent thinking.

Preferred Qualifications

Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Business, Environmental Management, and other related degree;

Basic understanding of economics, business concepts, and sustainability practices is strongly encouraged.

Prior experience in data collection, data entry, qualitative coding, and data entry is strongly desirable.

Skills:

Strong reading comprehension skills to carefully review and interpret detailed reports, identify key information, and synthesize content effectively.

Ability to process large volumes of qualitative information and quickly pinpoint relevant data.

Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite, especially Excel; familiarity with statistical tools is a plus.

Strong organizational and time-management skills to handle multiple projects effectively.

Excellent communication and interpersonal skills to collaborate with team members and faculty.

High attention to detail and ability to ensure accuracy and reliability in data collection and entry.

Ability to work independently, manage tasks, and make informed decisions when dealing with complex or unclear information.

Commitment to meeting deadlines and delivering high-quality work.

A strong work ethic and a commitment to the project’s goals and timelines ensure that the data collection process moves smoothly and efficiently.
