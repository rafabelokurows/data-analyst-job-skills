With privacy at heart, we always make sure to only collect the absolute minimum of data. Everything happening on our partner’s websites is anonymized, rigorously sampled, and free of any user-identifiable information.

Responsibilities:

Analyze: Deep dive into business, traffic and behavioral data to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for improvement.

Monitor: Set up and manage monitoring systems to ensure accuracy, reliability, and privacy compliance of all datasets as well as a smooth user experience.
Communicate: Clearly and effectively communicate data insights, recommendations and best-practices to your fellow contentpals.




Qualifications:

Seniority: At least 5 years of experience in similar roles is a must.
Analytical mindset: Strong analytical skills with the ability to extract meaningful insights from large-scale, anonymized datasets.
Technical proficiency: Deep knowledge of data analysis and manipulation languages (e.g. SQL, R or Python), data visualization tools (e.g. Looker Studio or Grafana), as well as data platforms (e.g. BigQuery, ClickHouse, or Snowflake)
Predictive Analytics: Hands-on experience with statistical modeling and advanced analytics techniques.
Growth hacking mentality: A passion for user acquisition, engagement, and retention, with a proactive approach to identifying growth opportunities. 
Communication skills: Excellent written and verbal communication skills (English) with the ability to present complex information in a clear and concise manner.
Startup spirit: A self-starter with a strong work ethic, a can-do attitude, and a willingness to roll up your sleeves and get things done. Always eager to learn.




Bonus points:

Entrepreneurial or Web-Developer experience 
Familiarity with subscription business models and digital content monetization strategies.
Background in online publishing or media.




Benefits:

Impact: Make a real difference in a fast-growing startup and shape the future of digital publishing.

Learning: Continuously expand your knowledge and skills in a dynamic and innovative environment.

Culture: Be part of a passionate and supportive team that values collaboration and open communication.
Ownership: Besides a competitive salary we also offer equity

There has never been a more important moment to join our credit risk team. The energy sector is going through a period of once-in-a-generation volatility. Businesses and households are facing higher energy prices than they ever have before. For these reasons we are looking to add to our credit risk team with this new role. This team sits at the heart of everything we do to support customers that are struggling with their bills. We’re unique because we are genuinely a hybrid of a few different skills and mindsets:

1. Data analytics is our core skillset. Everyone in the team is very strong in this area

2. We have a firm understanding of the needs of our customers and the business

3. We work closely with the tech team, because we’re a tech company, so this how we solve customer problems, efficiently at scale


We work closely with our operations teams who are the people that speak directly to customers



What You'll Do


Take ownership of our management of customers who are struggling with their payments
Deep dive investigations into data in order to surface insight for decision making
Develop our reporting suite through the latest BI tools & technology stack
Develop our empathic approaches towards vulnerable customers
Create strategies to identify and prevent first party and third party fraud
Develop our machine learning models & policies that drive sophisticated decisions
Proactively identify new areas of opportunity
Challenge the status quo in terms of KPIs, objectives & strategy
Communicate complex data concepts effectively and confidently
Build great relationships with Data Science, Technology, Finance, Collections, Ops and other stakeholders



What You'll Need


Excellent SQL skills
A drive to solve problems using data



What would be a bonus:


Python data science stack (pandas, NumPy, Jupyter notebooks, Plotly/matplotlib, etc)
Familiarity with Git
Data visualization tool (Tableau, Looker, PowerBI or equivalent)
DBT
2-5 years experience of consumer credit risk or collections in the financial services, utilities or telecommunications industries

You have experience working in fast-paced teams where ideas flow freely from everyone.

The electricity grid is changing beyond recognition, and without deploying new software to orchestrate it, we'll be unable to decarbonise.

At Axle, we're building the infrastructure that'll underpin the decarbonised energy system. Our software crushes CO2 and energy costs. Our goal is insanely ambitious, and we're building a team to match the scale of this challenge. We've just raised a Seed round from world-leading investors including Accel (TechCrunch) and we're growing fast.

We make the technology to move energy usage to times when electricity is cheap and green. Our software controls vehicle charging, heating systems, and home batteries. We use machine learning to figure out what energy people will need, and when they'll need it. We control tens of thousands of energy assets, and we're growing quickly.

Axle is a unique startup. We're building in a legacy industry and moving gigawatt-hours of electrons in the real world, but we operate at lightning speed. We ship extraordinarily quickly, and we're experts in electricity systems. We're backed by some of the best investors in the world, and we're growing the team to meet customer demand.

Requirements

Read more about what we're building here.

At Axle, we read data from hundreds of thousands of devices every day. We then optimize the performance of those devices, and participate in electricity markets with them. As our business grows, we're looking for a driven data analyst to help build reporting, monitoring, and visualization across the business.

Some things you might work on:


Visualizing the charging patterns of thousands of electric vehicles
Building dashboards to help us understand which devices are online
Tracking our financial performance vs our revenue targets



You'll need:


Tech chops: you'll need comfort with SQL and basic Python knowledge to work with and automate our data processes
Strong analytical skills: you'll be speaking MW, kWh, and £ every day
Commercial instincts: we're looking for somebody who can help us spot opportunities lurking in our data!
A deep-seated motivation to combat climate change
Comfort moving fast in an uncertain and changeable environment



You can expect:


insane amounts of ownership
lots of fascinating data to get to grips with
the support of a world class engineering & commercial team


This role would suit an ambitious generalist with a strong analytical background. We don't care if you've held a role with a similar title before: if you've got a track record of getting things done in complex, data-heavy environments, let's chat.

Interview process


Initial interview
Take-home exercise
Final interview (in-person)
Offer, references, and welcome to the team!



Benefits

We love the idea of fully remote work but it doesn't... work. For very early stage companies, people learn faster, get on better, and accomplish more when they're spending a decent chunk of time together. We ask that you spend 2-3 days a week in our London office.

We are extremely keen to build a diverse company, and we're particularly eager to hear from candidates who don't fit the traditional role stereotypes. If you're motivated by our mission, please do reach out, even if you feel you might not ‘check all the boxes'.

Data insight and analytics is core to our decision-making at Mous, and a highly valued skill for anyone in the business.

📱 About Us

We are Mous. (Pronounced mouse, not moose.) Our vision is for everyone to live better with technology. With an in-house team of expert product engineers and designers, we’re constantly evolving in a rapidly changing market. We make high-performance tech accessories and innovative product ecosystems, crafted with purpose, and demonstrate their value through impactful content. We believe in show, not tell, so we produce extreme content to prove what our products can do, including throwing phones from helicopters, cranes and even the roof at Google HQ in California.

We started by designing a phone case that focused on high performance, optimal functionality and considered style. We have since expanded our product range to include ecosystems of MagSafe® compatible magnetic accessories, mechanical mounts for content creation and bikes, ultra-fast wireless chargers, and backpacks that all adhere to these principles.

Our products are for risk-takers and thrill-seekers as well as tech-lovers and city dwellers. We create solutions to the problems that come from busy lives and outlandish adventures. No matter what your everyday life looks like you can trust our products to expand the experiences you have with the tech you use the most.

A collaborative team player, you excel at communicating complex data findings in a clear, concise manner, making data accessible to all levels of the company.

You will be pivotal in understanding and addressing the data needs of various departments, including Ecommerce, Pricing, and Growth.

Create and refine dynamic dashboards to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and objectives and key results (OKRs), enhancing decision-making processes.

A 2:1 degree or higher under your belt (although this isn't a prerequisite)
Strong problem solver – never afraid to get stuck into the detail to uncover insights.
A knack for numbers with the confidence to tackle and interpret large, complex data sets.
A level of attention to detail that will put us all to shame! You'll understand that your accuracy is critical for the correct setup of our digital channels.
Use your strong communication skills to manage both internal stakeholders (ensuring effective planning and briefing of campaigns and execution) and external stakeholders to build lasting relationships.
A demonstrable commercial understanding with the ability to value and prioritise work ruthlessly.
Proven analytical and Excel/Power BI skills to build and evaluate hypotheses using data, with exposure to AB testing.
Agile and scrappy – you are action biased, embrace uncertainty with the tenacity to see things through to the end.

Workplace Type | Hybrid (2 Days WFH)

Contract | Full Time




We’re looking for a Marketing Data Analyst to join our Marketing, Communications & Ecom department in a newly created role. You will support the CRM and CRO teams with ongoing analysis, insights, and reporting to inform day-to-day trading decisions and long-term strategic goals. This is an exciting opportunity to contribute to a more data-led approach across the business, working closely with the Marketing and Trading teams to turn data into actionable insights that optimise and improve performance.




About the Company

Russell & Bromley is the destination luxury fashion footwear & accessories brand for the everyday. A leading force in British fashion with over 40 stores operating across the UK and Ireland.

Combining European craftsmanship with a British glint in the eye, Russell & Bromley offers iconic style and on-trend design that empowers people to feel exceptional every day.

Founded in Lewes in 1880, borne from a love story between Albion Russell’s daughter, Elizabeth, and George Bromley, today the business remains family-owned, operated, and proudly independent.




The Russell & Bromley business is entering an exciting period of growth with Vision 2030, an ambitious five-year roadmap to fuel our future success, under the leadership of CEO Andrew Bromley. Strategic actions include a commitment to brand and product transformation, continued growth of our UK & IRE retail footprint, and accelerated international expansion. This is an exciting opportunity to join us at a key inflection point in the business, coinciding with the launch of our first seasonal collection with new Creative Director, Daniel Beardsworth-Shaw, and the relocation of our Global HQ to Kingly St. W1 in the heart of Soho. This will now be home to our in-house design, creative, and product studios. Do you want to be part of our next chapter?




About the Role

Consistently monitor and analyse performance of cross-channel marketing campaigns (email, social media, paid ads, SEO) to measure impact and ROI.
Develop dashboards and reports to track key marketing, customer, and trading metrics on an ongoing basis.
Turn data and analytics into actionable insights for the CRM & CRO teams to inform and improve trading efforts.
Partner with CRM & CRO teams to optimise the customer journey, supporting testing roadmaps, segmentation, and personalisation trials.
Proactively monitor data to provide timely performance insights for wider teams to react quickly to trading challenges.
Use A/B testing, customer segmentation, and predictive analytics to optimise marketing strategies.
Interpret data from Google Analytics, CRM platforms (Salesforce, HubSpot), and advertising platforms (Google Ads, Meta Ads, etc.).
Clean, process, and visualise data using tools like Excel, SQL, Python, R, or BI tools (Tableau, Power BI).
Provide insights on consumer behaviour and market trends to support strategic decision-making.
Collaborate with stakeholders to improve campaign targeting and budget allocation.




About You

2+ years of experience in data analytics, preferably in marketing or e-commerce (preferred).
Strong proficiency in Excel and data visualisation tools (e.g., Power BI).
Experience with ESP platforms (SAP/Emarsys, Wunderkind) and Google Analytics.
Familiarity with A/B testing, customer segmentation, and marketing attribution models.
Strong problem-solving and communication skills.
Ability to work with large datasets and extract meaningful insights.




Due to the high volume of applications, we regret that we will only be able to contact successful candidates within two weeks.

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

YOUR ROLE

In the Data Analytics team you will ensure both the voice of the customer and CFO are represented in the room with hard evidence. As well as supporting exceptional customer experiences using data, you will help ensure every action we take is directly improving performance against your clients objectives.

As an Analyst, you will work under supervision to deliver projects within set deadlines, utilisng your strong hands on analytical capabilities. Your strengths in Python and SQL will ensure you can efficiently deliver robust analytics with guidance from your team.

Your experience with web and social analytics tools (GA / Adobe / Brandwatch / Sprinklr) and data visualisation tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker / etc) will enable you to uncover key insights across channels and create self-service dashboards.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

We’re looking for a Marketing Data Analyst to join our Marketing, Communications & Ecom department in a newly created role. You will support the CRM and CRO teams with ongoing analysis, insights, and reporting to inform day-to-day trading decisions and long-term strategic goals.

About the Company

Russell & Bromley is the destination luxury fashion footwear & accessories brand for the everyday. A leading force in British fashion with over 40 stores operating across the UK and Ireland.

Combining European craftsmanship with a British glint in the eye, Russell & Bromley offers iconic style and on-trend design that empowers people to feel exceptional every day.

Founded in Lewes in 1880, borne from a love story between Albion Russell’s daughter, Elizabeth, and George Bromley, today the business remains family-owned, operated, and proudly independent.




The Russell & Bromley business is entering an exciting period of growth with Vision 2030, an ambitious five-year roadmap to fuel our future success, under the leadership of CEO Andrew Bromley. Strategic actions include a commitment to brand and product transformation, continued growth of our UK & IRE retail footprint, and accelerated international expansion. This is an exciting opportunity to join us at a key inflection point in the business, coinciding with the launch of our first seasonal collection with new Creative Director, Daniel Beardsworth-Shaw, and the relocation of our Global HQ to Kingly St. W1 in the heart of Soho. This will now be home to our in-house design, creative, and product studios. Do you want to be part of our next chapter?

Clean, process, and visualise data using tools like Excel, SQL, Python, R, or BI tools (Tableau, Power BI).
Provide insights on consumer behaviour and market trends to support strategic decision-making.
Collaborate with stakeholders to improve campaign targeting and budget allocation.




About You

2+ years of experience in data analytics, preferably in marketing or e-commerce (preferred).
Strong proficiency in Excel and data visualisation tools (e.g., Power BI).
Experience with ESP platforms (SAP/Emarsys, Wunderkind) and Google Analytics.
Familiarity with A/B testing, customer segmentation, and marketing attribution models.
Strong problem-solving and communication skills.
Ability to work with large datasets and extract meaningful insights.

Zero100 is a membership-based intelligence platform that connects, informs, and inspires the world’s most influential C-Level Operations & Supply Chain Officers – and their teams – to unlock the true potential of the AI and Digital Revolution for the lasting benefit of business and our planet. Our members use Zero100’s research and advisory services to shape their supply chain strategies, and they harness the power of our community to expand their thinking, challenge their assumptions, and accelerate progress on their most important digitisation and decarbonisation initiatives.




With a rapidly expanding headquarters in central London, we’re proud to be backed by leading investors and supported by an impressive list of founding members that includes Unilever, Google, The Estee Lauder Companies, and Volvo.




Position Summary

We are seeking a highly motivated Research Data Analyst to support our research analytics endeavours. This unique position offers the opportunity to work closely with both our data and research teams, pushing the boundaries of data exploration on research related to supply chain innovation, digitization, and decarbonization.




Note: This is a primarily office-based role (4 days per week in office and 1 day work from home per week). Candidates must have the right to work in the UK, though Tier 2 visa sponsorship is available for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements.




In this role, your primary focus will be explorative analysis, using strong analytical skills to frame the right questions and delve into data in search of emerging patterns. The data team will support you with data discovery, ingestion, and quality assurance, while you’ll use SQL and Python to self-serve from our internal SQL database, allowing for efficient and autonomous exploration, and follow your own curiosity to pursue new inputs for dataset creation. With the research team, you will write reports and prepare frameworks and deliverables aligned with our research agenda, while reserving a portion of your time to support customer engagements.




Key Responsibilities

Engage in hypothesis-driven explorative analysis to uncover new insights and answer questions around supply chain digitization and decarbonization.
Frame and refine data-focused questions that address strategic industry topics.
Over time, you'll play a role in mentoring junior team members, sharing best practices in hypothesis generation to help them approach data-driven questions with a strategic lens.
Independently query our internal SQL databases allowing you to self-serve and explore data without heavy dependencies on the data team.
Collaborate closely with data team members to identify, ingest, and prepare new datasets relevant to your research.
Conduct primary research on AI and other advanced technology implementations within the supply chain sector.
Visualize and present findings in ways that enhance understanding and support decision-making.
Work with Research Directors to shape insights into member-facing content, including keynotes at our conferences, and strategic reports.




Who you are

You are an experienced research analyst, research manager, or data analyst with a curiosity-driven, critically minded approach to research analytics. With 4-6 years of professional experience in this field, you have solid SQL skills and are adept at both identifying the right questions to ask and creating innovative ways to answer them, including developing proxies and leveraging unconventional data sources. You thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment and are excited by the challenge of uncovering new patterns and insights to drive industry-leading research.




Requirements

Basic proficiency in Python and SQL (BigQuery), with the ability to self-serve analysis queries and modify existing code for more complex and advanced data manipulation - preference given to candidates with more extensive skills.
Strong analytical mindset, with a talent for framing the right questions to drive meaningful explorative analysis.
Ability to visualize data effectively, ideally with experience in PowerBI or similar tools. Excel is a must.
Experience conducting exploratory analysis to derive insights from large, complex datasets.
Exceptional problem-solving skills to tackle multifaceted data questions and identifying new data sources.
Strong communication skills for explaining findings in research reports and discussions with cross-functional teams.
Ability to work both independently on explorative projects and collaboratively within a fast-paced environment.




Preferred Qualifications:

Exposure to data science, LLMs, or machine learning, especially in exploratory contexts.
Experience and/or interest in AI and its applications within supply chain.
Academic background or strong interest in supply chain or similar field.
Experience working with APIs.
Experience working in start-up and/or scale-up environments.

Competitive Salary
Private Healthcare
Enhanced pension/401k
Unlimited vacation policy

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$181,700. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

To do this, we start with our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization.

Data is at the heart of Lyft’s products and decision-making. You will leverage data and rigorous, analytical thinking to shape our products and make business decisions. This will involve performing rigorous product deep dives, identifying opportunities for product enhancements, and measuring the impact of new features.

The Verticals team encompasses 3 critical and unique products / marketplaces within Lyft: airports, scheduled rides, and events. Airports are one of the most important, impactful, and complex parts of Lyft’s Rideshare business, as they are a key part of both the rider and driver Lyft experience and have unique dynamics. Scheduled rides allow riders to book a ride in advance with high reliability, and enable drivers to add structure to their work schedule. Lastly, events such as concerts or sporting games require similar considerations of special operations to ensure a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.

As a Senior Data Analyst on the Verticals team, you will collaborate with engineering, product, design, operations, and marketing to think critically about the current rider and driver experience and implement product enhancements to facilitate market growth. The ideal candidate can apply strong business acumen to propose product and marketplace changes, and is comfortable working with a highly cross functional team. In this role, you will help us tackle problems such as:


Which airports are underperforming and which key metrics can we use to identify and classify airport performance? What targets should we set for these key metrics?
What is driving high cancellation rates today and which types of riders/drivers are cancelling? What product changes can we implement to reduce cancellation rates for scheduled rides?
How are riders and drivers using different ride modes at airports and events, and how do we design products to address this behavior?
How are riders and drivers discovering scheduled rides and are there entry point optimizations we can implement?


Responsibilities:


Leverage data and analytic frameworks to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency across Verticals products, recommending solutions to drive business impact
Understand the complex business dynamics across the Verticals product areas, specifically how these products differ from traditional rideshare marketplaces, to propose enhancements that compliment Lyft-wide products
Partner with product managers, engineers, marketers, designers, and operators to translate data insights into decisions and action
Develop dashboards and analytical frameworks to monitor business and product performance
Establish metrics that measure the health of our products, the business, as well as the rider and driver experiences


Experience:


5-7+ years of experience in data analytics in a high-growth environment
Degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, economics, applied math, operations research or engineering (an asset, advanced degrees also an asset)
End-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, analysis, and visualization
Ability to manage, influence, negotiate, and inspire others in a fast-moving environment
Proficient in SQL and quantitative analysis, you can deep dive into large amounts of data, draw meaningful insights, dissect business issues and draw actionable conclusions
Outcome-driven approach to developing recommendations and demonstrated ability to develop a story and execution plan to support goals and objectives
Exceptional communication (listening, written, and oral) skills with the ability to present findings and recommendations targeted to the audience in question.
A drive to understand the core issues along with the determination to uncover the solution
Thrives within ambiguity and context-switching
Strong oral and written communication skills, and ability to collaborate with cross-functional partners


Benefits:


Extended health and dental coverage options, along with life insurance and disability benefits
Mental health benefits
Family building benefits
Child care and pet benefits
Access to a Lyft funded Health Care Savings Account
RRSP plan to help save for your future
In addition to provincial observed holidays, salaried team members are covered under Lyft's flexible paid time off policy. The policy allows team members to take off as much time as they need (with manager approval). Hourly team members get 15 days paid time off, with an additional day for each year of service
Lyft is proud to support new parents with 18 weeks of paid time off, designed as a top-up plan to complement provincial programs. Biological, adoptive, and foster parents are all eligible.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$181,700. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management Ltd.

Vancouver, BC

We are looking for a Quantitative Equity Analyst to join our Quantitative Equity Team! We are a high-performance team embedded in a top-performing quant fund, dedicated to the mission-critical operation of our investment engine—a well-tuned machine responsible for generating key decisions that drive trades and investment insights. Leveraging finance skills and cutting-edge technology, we ensure data quality, continuous process improvement, and operational excellence.

As a core member of our team, you'll collaborate with investment experts to tackle challenging analytical problems, be accountable to ensure accurate and timely trade generation, and drive operational innovation.

This is an exciting full-time role for individuals who are passionate about learning the quantitative equity investment management business and excited to tackle a broad range of investment, mathematical, and technology challenges.

Respond to and mitigate vendor data issues effectively in a production setting.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate traditional and alternative data into existing analytical frameworks and decision-making processes.
Present findings and recommendations to key stakeholders in a clear, concise, and compelling manner.


Process and Reliability Engineering


Design, implement and test production processes to run the alpha and risk, portfolio optimization and market implementation processes.
Design robust, high performance and effective process orchestration.
Monitor production health and respond to critical issues in a timely manner.
Effectively communicate real-time production issues to portfolio managers, traders and researchers.
Identify computational bottle necks and improve run speeds in production systems.
Collaborate with investment teams to ensure their process needs are being met.
Find and evaluate areas for process improvements.
