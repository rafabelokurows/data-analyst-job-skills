About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of 220 people and 37 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

Getreu unserem Motto – People is what makes us us – sind uns deine nachhaltige Ausbildung und Weiterentwicklung, deine ausgeglichene Work-Life-Balance und deine Happiness sehr wichtig. Konkret stellen wir mit 32 Urlaubstagen, 60 % mobilem Arbeiten, bis zu 4 Wochen pro Jahr – im europäischen Ausland – der Möglichkeit remote zu arbeiten, Sabbatical und Überstundenausgleich sicher, dass dir im FUSE-Agentur-Leben nichts fehlt.

In unserem derzeit über 60-köpfigen Team sowie unseren Kund*innen haben wir unser perfektes Match bereits gefunden. Wenn du noch auf der Suche bist, bei „popkulturellem Relevanzmarketing“ neugierig wirst und für Social Media, Influencer Marketing oder Gaming & Esports brennst, dann lass uns zusammen loslegen! Denn : Action Creates Impact .

Dein Job

Als (Junior) Insights Analyst (mensch) bearbeitest du als Teil unseres Data und Analytics Teams in erster Linie die Anfragen unserer Kunden nach Social Media Reportings sowie Social Listening Analysen und beherrschst den Spagat zwischen analytischem und kreativem Denken, um die Kolleg:Innen in deinem und anderen Teams mit datenbasierten Insights zu Kundenmeinungen, Märkten, Zielgruppen, Marken und ihren Social Media-Umfeldern zu versorgen.

Dein Aufgabenbereich

Datenbeschaffung / Toolbedienung

Du bist präzise, schnell, zuverlässig und motiviert, wenn es um die manuelle Erfassung großer (Social Media)- Datenmengen geht, aber auch wissbegierig und begeisterungsfähig, dich diesbezüglich kontinuierlich mit Prozessoptimierung zu befassen, sowie dich in Tools und automatisierte Datenerfassungsprozesse und Methoden einzudenken, um immer bessere Lösungen zu finden.

Datenstrukturierung, Effiziente Datensammlung, Query Writing, Kategorisierung und Datendarstellung werden hier deine täglichen Begleiter.

Studiendurchführung

Von der (manchmal noch recht schwammigen) Fragestellung bis zum fertigen Analysebericht mit guten Insights und Handlungsempfehlungen ist es oft ein weiter aber spannender Weg. Der kann bald auch deiner sein, gemeinsam mit uns im Team.

Du hast ein sehr gutes Gespür für Sprache und Kommunikation? Nice, das brauchst du hier in mindestens dreierlei Hinsicht: Erstens, um aus den Aussagen und Briefings unserer Auftraggeber herausfiltern zu können, wie du ihnen am besten weiterhelfen kannst. Zweitens, wenn es darum geht, die Essenz von Konsumenten-Posts und Kommentaren auf Social Media zu verstehen, schließlich ist Inhaltanalyse unser Daily-Business. Und Drittens, um dann Deine Findings Zielgruppengerecht rüberzubringen - in Reports, in Meetings und bei Präsentationen.

Datenanalyse

Auswertungslogiken passend zu den gegebenen Fragestellungen und Erkenntnisinteressen erstellen, Dimensionierungen & Kategorisierungen für Inhaltsanalysen planen und entwickeln, Daten auszählen, filtern, darstellen, vergleichen, interpretieren, daraus kreative Idee und Empfehlungen ableiten. Das ist dein Playground. Deine Affinität zu Zahlen und Daten kannst du hier immer wieder beweisen. Ein stets strukturiertes Vorgehen und ein souveräner Umgang auch mit großen und komplexen Datenmengen, Statistiken und Zahlen sind für dich selbstverständlich.

Spezielle Social Media Analyse-Tools wirst Du ebenso (kennenlernen und) zum Einsatz bringen wie ganz viel Excel und das gute alte Powerpoint.

Das bringst du mit

Du kannst (erste) Erfahrung in der qualitativen und quantitativen Forschungsarbeit, sowie in der marketing- oder kundenorientierten Projektarbeit vorweisen und hast Lust dich im Bereich Social Media Analytics weiter auszutoben. Du hast, dank deines Studiums, einen kommunikations-, sozial- oder medienwissenschaftlichen Background und bringst Kenntnisse der Methoden im Bereich der quantitativen und qualitativen Marktforschung mit. Du hast neben den analytischen Fähigkeiten, auch ein Gespür für gute kreative Kommunikation und Lust, diese mitzuentwickeln. Du bist organisiert und selbständig, willst aber auch noch ständig ganz viel lernen und verstehst dich als Teamplayer, der immer auf Höhe des Zeitgeists ist und daraus neue Impulse für unsere Teams und Kunden ableitet. Außerdem hast Du sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse in Wort und Schrift, sehr gute MS Office Kenntnisse, insbesondere Excel und PowerPoint und bist im besten Fall mit Analytics Tools im Bereich Social Listening & Web Analytics vertraut.

Darum wir

Als Teil der FUSE erfährst du stets Rückenwind von deinem Team, arbeitest für Kunden - die unsere Werte „BOLD. TRUE. EASY. TOGETHER.“ leben und kannst aktiv Prozesse und Strukturen mitentwickeln. Denn ganz getreu unserem Wert TOGETHER setzen wir auf das Potential im Team. Neben unvergesslichen Events bieten wir dir viel Raum für persönliche und berufliche Weiterentwicklung.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

We are looking for a Data Analyst that is passionate about metrics and telling the stories behind the data. We have several roles open across different teams (grocery, loyalty, restaurants). Data Analysts at Deliveroo report into our data science management team.

You will be a professional in insights storytelling, communication and visualisation and know how to create action from metrics. Crafting effective intelligent benchmarks, understanding performance, caring about data quality, enabling automation and creating phenomenal visualisations and stories are things that drive you.

What you'll be doing



Work closely with commercial stakeholders to create value and business impact through better data availability, visualisation and analysis
Discover, analyse, and interpret trends or patterns in complex datasets to perform ad-hoc analyses and deliver insights to the executive team and senior management
Understand key drivers of the business and provide data driven guidance on key levers
Identify and specify data needs and quality requirements and work closely with Analytics Engineers to ensure data is available, accurate and corresponds to the business needs
Consolidate and distribute best analytical practices from different teams and countries



Requirements



Experience identifying the root cause of problems, assessing risks/impacts and determining and implementing effective solutions.
A good understanding of querying in SQL and understanding of database structure - you'll be expected to be able to extract the data you need for your analysis.
Compelling story-telling skills, and an eye for powerful visualisations - you'll need to translate your findings for all levels of stakeholder (business and technical)
Good knowledge of Excel/GSheets - depending on the task, there is a good chance that this is where some of your exploratory analysis will take place. Being comfortable with pivot tables and functions will be essential.
Developer experience with a data visualisation tool (Looker, Tableau, Periscope)

Our small Canadian-born business was founded in 1978 and has become a global organization that now spans 120 locations across 20 countries. Our expansion has been rapid, but what matters most is the common belief that drives all 5,000 of our people to be a different type of real estate organization. We believe that the places in which we live, work and play have the power to make us happier and healthier, and we are united by a shared sense of purpose, to have a positive impact on people’s lives. In short, we are a global commercial real estate advisory firm with a simple aim: for real estate to play a leading role in creating vibrant buildings, cities and places that deliver long-lasting social value and economic impact.

Why Work For Us

We believe that our industry is changing, and we want our business to be a melting pot of curious minds, passionate hearts and strategic intelligence.

Our distinctive Principal-led, privately-owned model puts us in the enviable position of being able to offer every employee the opportunity to own a share of our business and inspires and allows anyone to become a Principal. This role carries voting rights, so our people have a very real say in the future direction and operation of our business.

At Zego, we understand that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't reflect how well you actually drive. Since 2016, we have been on a mission to change that by offering the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are the driving force behind everything we do. We've sold tens of millions of policies and raised over $200 million in funding. And we're only just getting started.




About the Role

We are looking for a highly motivated Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst to support our growing insurance business in a co-insurance environment. This role involves managing communication across co-insurers and internal stakeholders, analysing complex data, and providing reports to our co-insurers. The ideal candidate will have a strong background in data analytics, insurance operations, and financial performance metrics, along with excellent interpersonal skills to facilitate conversations between co-insurers and Zego.




Key Responsibilities

Data Analysis & Reporting: Develop and maintain comprehensive reports and dashboards for insurance and financial operations, focusing on co-insurance arrangements. This includes claims analysis, underwriting performance, premium forecasts, and consumer duty metric
Stakeholder Communication: Act as the key point of contact for BI-related discussions with co-insurers, ensuring clarity and alignment on data-driven insights, performance metrics, and contract management. Facilitate regular communication and meetings with external and internal stakeholders
Financial Modeling: Collaborate with finance and data engineering teams to create financial models that provide insights into revenue, costs, and profitability under co-insurance arrangements. Ensure accurate forecasting, budgeting, and KPI monitoring
Data Management: Work closely with data engineering teams to ensure accurate and timely ingestion of data from key sources (e.g., claims management systems, co-insurers, and financial systems). Ensure data quality, integrity, and consistency across entities




About You

Proven experience in BI analysis within the insurance and finance sectors
Advanced proficiency with BI tools (e.g., Looker, Power BI, Tableau) and data analytics platforms
Strong understanding of insurance metrics (claims, premiums, loss ratios, underwriting performance) and financial reporting
Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with experience managing relationships between co-insurers and internal teams
Strong attention to detail and a proactive problem-solving approach

Nice to have:

​Experience working in a co-insurance environment, including communication with multiple insurers
Familiarity with insurance-specific systems such as claims management platforms (e.g., Sharedo) and finance software
Experience in data modeling, SQL, and working with large datasets
Experience in financial reconciliation processes and insurance accounting




What's it like to work at Zego

Joining Zego is a career-defining move. People go further here, reaching their full potential to achieve extraordinary things.




We're spread throughout the UK and Europe, and united by our drive to get things done. We're proud of our company and our culture - a friendly and inclusive space where we can lift each other up and celebrate our wins every day.




Together, we're setting the bar higher, delivering exceptional work that makes a difference. Our people are the most important part of our story, and everyone here plays a role. There's loads of room to learn and grow, and you'll get the freedom to steer your career wherever you

want.




You'll work alongside a talented group who embrace each other's differences and aren't afraid of a challenge. We recognise our achievements, learn from our mistakes, and help each other to be the best we can be. Together, we're making insurance matter




How we work

We believe that teams work better when they have time to collaborate and space to get things done. We call it Zego Hybrid. We ask you to spend at least one day a week in our central London office. We think it's a good mix of collaborative face time and flexible home-working, setting us up to achieve the right balance between work and life.




Benefits

We reward our people well. Join us and you'll get a market-competitive salary, private medical insurance, company share options, generous holiday allowance, and a whole lot of wellbeing benefits. And that's just for starters. We also cover the costs for all company-wide events (3 per year), and also provide a separate hybrid contribution to help pay towards other travel costs




We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status

Our mission is to give everyone access to a richer life, helping everyone to enjoy a happier, healthier relationship with money. We've already helped over a million people by giving them the tools they need to achieve their goals, feel good and do a little better — from building their credit scores to growing their savings, to just understanding how it all works. Rapid experimentation to find what works, and learn as much as we can, is at the heart of our growth story.




What you'll do




As a Data Analyst, you know that it’s not just about the data we have, but what we do with it that counts. In this key role within the data team, you will use your analytical expertise and strategic thinking to shape our marketing investment while helping to scale and strengthen our team. You'll transform complex business problems into questions, insights and actions that will underpin marketing decisions across partnership, member acquisition, lifecycle, and brand and content teams. You’ll also collaborate cross-functionally with product, engineering and finance teams to optimise our marketing efforts, improve customer engagement, and maximise our ROI.




You will:

Play a role in continuous improvement by identifying trends, patterns, and opportunities for further optimisation
Find the “so what?” in the results, and highlight what we could seek to learn or ask next.
Provide high quality monitoring and reporting on the performance of campaigns and experiments
Work closely within squads to formulate hypotheses we can test that are based on insights derived from your data analysis.
Support the wider data team to answer the big questions that feed into Loqbox’s strategy.




Who you are

You are motivated by a love of your work and a connection to the mission of the business.
You are a strong collaborator, communicator and team player, with experience of leveraging the skills and knowledge around you in the wider business to find the answer.
You have good presentation skills, and enjoy sharing what you’ve found in a way that’s easy to understand.
You are full of curiosity and passionate about continuous learning, especially when it comes to tools and trends that allow you to make an impact with data.
You have a grasp of statistical methods and their practical application, such as significance testing or linear regression.
You have some experience using SQL and you are excited about developing your technical skills. It’s a bonus if you know Python or R for data manipulation and analysis.
You relentlessly look beyond the data to find the “so what?” in the analysis.
You have experience working in fast-paced teams where ideas flow freely from everyone.

Competitive salary - based on your level of experience
Annual bonus
£500 richer life fund
25 days holiday plus bank holidays, a day off in your birthday month, variable Christmas closure

Create and refine dynamic dashboards to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and objectives and key results (OKRs), enhancing decision-making processes.
Proactively identify areas for improvement within the company's processes and systems and implement automated solutions.
Lead and support strategic cross-department initiatives to drive value. E.g. Pricing Optimisation, Segmentation Analysis, Marketing Mix Modelling.
Support in building out fundamental data sources, to allow analysis of data from multiple key platforms.

A 2:1 degree or higher under your belt (although this isn't a prerequisite)
Strong problem solver – never afraid to get stuck into the detail to uncover insights.
A knack for numbers with the confidence to tackle and interpret large, complex data sets.
A level of attention to detail that will put us all to shame! You'll understand that your accuracy is critical for the correct setup of our digital channels.
Use your strong communication skills to manage both internal stakeholders (ensuring effective planning and briefing of campaigns and execution) and external stakeholders to build lasting relationships.
A demonstrable commercial understanding with the ability to value and prioritise work ruthlessly.
Proven analytical and Excel/Power BI skills to build and evaluate hypotheses using data, with exposure to AB testing.
Agile and scrappy – you are action biased, embrace uncertainty with the tenacity to see things through to the end.

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that values diversity and emphasises personal well-being.

MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

We are already recognised as a global leader in the fight to decarbonise the planet by revolutionising what’s possible in energy - including investments in renewable energy supply, renewable energy generation, smart energy networks, EVs, heat pumps, etc. The government's new green initiatives and the recent investment by Al Gore’s Generation Fund will propel us further and faster.

There has never been a more important moment to join our credit risk team. The energy sector is going through a period of once-in-a-generation volatility. Businesses and households are facing higher energy prices than they ever have before. For these reasons we are looking to add to our credit risk team with this new role. This team sits at the heart of everything we do to support customers that are struggling with their bills. We’re unique because we are genuinely a hybrid of a few different skills and mindsets:

1. Data analytics is our core skillset. Everyone in the team is very strong in this area

2. We have a firm understanding of the needs of our customers and the business

3. We work closely with the tech team, because we’re a tech company, so this how we solve customer problems, efficiently at scale


We work closely with our operations teams who are the people that speak directly to customers



What You'll Do


Take ownership of our management of customers who are struggling with their payments
Deep dive investigations into data in order to surface insight for decision making
Develop our reporting suite through the latest BI tools & technology stack
Develop our empathic approaches towards vulnerable customers
Create strategies to identify and prevent first party and third party fraud
Develop our machine learning models & policies that drive sophisticated decisions
Proactively identify new areas of opportunity
Challenge the status quo in terms of KPIs, objectives & strategy
Communicate complex data concepts effectively and confidently
Build great relationships with Data Science, Technology, Finance, Collections, Ops and other stakeholders



What You'll Need


Excellent SQL skills
A drive to solve problems using data



What would be a bonus:


Python data science stack (pandas, NumPy, Jupyter notebooks, Plotly/matplotlib, etc)
Familiarity with Git
Data visualization tool (Tableau, Looker, PowerBI or equivalent)
DBT
2-5 years experience of consumer credit risk or collections in the financial services, utilities or telecommunications industries

Our small Canadian-born business was founded in 1978 and has become a global organization that now spans 120 locations across 20 countries. Our expansion has been rapid, but what matters most is the common belief that drives all 5,000 of our people to be a different type of real estate organization. We believe that the places in which we live, work and play have the power to make us happier and healthier, and we are united by a shared sense of purpose, to have a positive impact on people’s lives. In short, we are a global commercial real estate advisory firm with a simple aim: for real estate to play a leading role in creating vibrant buildings, cities and places that deliver long-lasting social value and economic impact.

Why Work For Us

We believe that our industry is changing, and we want our business to be a melting pot of curious minds, passionate hearts and strategic intelligence. Your gender, religion and race are all highly respected, but are less important to us than your ability to step up and change the game. We provide you with a place where you can do just that, with like-minded people. Collaboration is embedded in the way we work – our people have the autonomy to collaborate on client relationships, engage teams across the business, lead operations, work collectively on projects, participate in strategy and are ultimately responsible for our growth. Our distinctive Principal-led, privately-owned model puts us in the enviable position of being able to offer every employee the opportunity to own a share of our business and inspires and allows anyone to become a Principal.

40% of all food produced in the world is wasted. And that has a huge impact on the health of our planet, with 10% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from food waste.

We’re more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation with a mission to empower everyone to take action against food waste, so alongside our marketplace app, we create educational tools, explore new business solutions - such as our Retail Technologies offering, and influence legislation to help reduce food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 113 million registered users and 240,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 419+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.132.000 tonnes of CO2e!

Your mission

We are seeking a talented and driven Data Analyst to join us in shaping the future of our newly established Demand Analytics team. The successful candidate will play a pivotal role in enhancing our team's capabilities around Marketing analytics while benefiting from a robust support structure designed to foster growth and innovation. We are also ready to consider candidates with more work experience as Senior Data Analyst.

As a Marketplace, Marketing is one of Too Good To Go’s most powerful levers for driving demand. Consequently, a strong foundation in marketing metrics is essential for this role. The models and methodologies you will help develop are largely marketing-focused, emphasizing the importance of experience with causal impact modeling and econometric modeling.

That said, Demand Analytics at Too Good To Go extends beyond Marketing. We are looking for someone who can also contribute to broader analytical initiatives, such as demand forecasting and other data-driven projects.

If you’re passionate about leveraging analytics to make a real-world impact and thrive in a dynamic, collaborative environment, we’d love to hear from you.

Your role


Support business leaders in identifying the right KPIs to drive business performance
Provide data-driven guidance to business leaders on key strategic decisions
Design and deliver self-service tools to various functional groups for operational excellence
Collaborate with marketing teams to optimize campaign strategies and resource allocation based on data-driven insights
Conduct in-depth analyses to identify the drivers of demand and measure marketing impact
Utilize marketing insights to inform and enhance demand forecasting models


Requirements


You have an understanding of Marketing Data and KPIs, or a strong appetite to learn this space.
Having experience in analyzing and interpreting marketing performance metrics would be a clear advantage.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists, and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you’ll do

About The Internship Experience

Our internship program provides the opportunity to work on meaningful business initiatives that will grow the GDP of the internet. Through the internship, you will work with many systems and technologies, gain experience in working with large datasets and analytical methodologies/tools to help us better understand our users and build better products.

Each intern has a dedicated mentor, and every intern project is part of the team's roadmap that will directly contribute to Stripe's mission. As you collaborate with industry experts on initiatives that expand global commerce, you will develop a strong first-hand understanding of the role analytics plays in steering business strategy and results.

We're not just focused on your immediate contributions; we're invested in your growth. Stripe sees this internship as an opportunity to grow your technical expertise and facilitate personal development, preparing you for a career in the tech industry.

Responsibilities

You will:


Partner closely with Data Scientists, Data Analysts, and business partners to drive business impact through rigorous analytical solutions
Apply machine learning, causal inference, or advanced analytics on large datasets to: i) measure results and outcomes, ii) identify causal impact and attribution, iii) predict the future performance of users or products, to drive business success
Influence business actions and strategy by developing actionable insights through metrics and dashboards.
Drive the collection of new data and the refinement of existing data sources.
Learn quickly by asking great questions, finding how to work with your mentor and teammates effectively, and communicating the status of your work clearly
Present your work to the Data Science team, partner teams, and fellow interns



Who you are

Minimum Requirements

We’re looking for someone who has:


Enrolled in a quantitative Master's program (e.g. Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, Statistics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2025 or spring/summer 2026
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Experience communicating and collaborating with multidisciplinary stakeholders in a team environment



Preferred Qualifications

You also likely have:


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects
Ability to learn new systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, San Francisco Bay Area, or New York City. We are hiring these positions in Chicago, IL or Toronto, Ontario, Canada.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $135,200 - $135,200. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300.

To do this, we start with our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization.

Data is at the heart of Lyft’s products and decision-making. You will leverage data and rigorous, analytical thinking to shape our products and make business decisions. This will involve performing rigorous product deep dives, identifying opportunities for product enhancements, and measuring the impact of new features.

The Verticals team encompasses 3 critical and unique products / marketplaces within Lyft: airports, scheduled rides, and events. Airports are one of the most important, impactful, and complex parts of Lyft’s Rideshare business, as they are a key part of both the rider and driver Lyft experience and have unique dynamics. Scheduled rides allow riders to book a ride in advance with high reliability, and enable drivers to add structure to their work schedule. Lastly, events such as concerts or sporting games require similar considerations of special operations to ensure a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.

As a Senior Data Analyst on the Verticals team, you will collaborate with engineering, product, design, operations, and marketing to think critically about the current rider and driver experience and implement product enhancements to facilitate market growth. The ideal candidate can apply strong business acumen to propose product and marketplace changes, and is comfortable working with a highly cross functional team. In this role, you will help us tackle problems such as:


Which airports are underperforming and which key metrics can we use to identify and classify airport performance? What targets should we set for these key metrics?
What is driving high cancellation rates today and which types of riders/drivers are cancelling? What product changes can we implement to reduce cancellation rates for scheduled rides?
How are riders and drivers using different ride modes at airports and events, and how do we design products to address this behavior?
How are riders and drivers discovering scheduled rides and are there entry point optimizations we can implement?


Responsibilities:


Leverage data and analytic frameworks to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency across Verticals products, recommending solutions to drive business impact
Understand the complex business dynamics across the Verticals product areas, specifically how these products differ from traditional rideshare marketplaces, to propose enhancements that compliment Lyft-wide products
Partner with product managers, engineers, marketers, designers, and operators to translate data insights into decisions and action
Develop dashboards and analytical frameworks to monitor business and product performance
Establish metrics that measure the health of our products, the business, as well as the rider and driver experiences


Experience:


5-7+ years of experience in data analytics in a high-growth environment
Degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, economics, applied math, operations research or engineering (an asset, advanced degrees also an asset)
End-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, analysis, and visualization
Ability to manage, influence, negotiate, and inspire others in a fast-moving environment
Proficient in SQL and quantitative analysis, you can deep dive into large amounts of data, draw meaningful insights, dissect business issues and draw actionable conclusions
Outcome-driven approach to developing recommendations and demonstrated ability to develop a story and execution plan to support goals and objectives
Exceptional communication (listening, written, and oral) skills with the ability to present findings and recommendations targeted to the audience in question.
A drive to understand the core issues along with the determination to uncover the solution
Thrives within ambiguity and context-switching
Strong oral and written communication skills, and ability to collaborate with cross-functional partners


Benefits:


Extended health and dental coverage options, along with life insurance and disability benefits
Mental health benefits
Family building benefits
Child care and pet benefits
Access to a Lyft funded Health Care Savings Account
RRSP plan to help save for your future
In addition to provincial observed holidays, salaried team members are covered under Lyft's flexible paid time off policy. The policy allows team members to take off as much time as they need (with manager approval). Hourly team members get 15 days paid time off, with an additional day for each year of service
Lyft is proud to support new parents with 18 weeks of paid time off, designed as a top-up plan to complement provincial programs. Biological, adoptive, and foster parents are all eligible.
Subsidized commuter benefits

We are funded by the best investors in the world including:

a16z, Sequoia, PayPal, Binance Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Uniswap Labs, Circle Ventures, Delphi Digital, and many more.

About The Role

As we continue to grow at LayerZero, we're faced with an exciting set of challenges: more data, more developers, more teams, more projects, and more opportunities for innovation. To tackle these problems head-on, we're expanding our data team with a dedicated Data Analyst.

As a Data Analyst at LayerZero, you'll be at the forefront of shaping a rich data foundation for a company that's making a real impact in the web3 space. You'll work closely with teams and leaders to uncover insights, drive decision-making, and fuel our next-generation products and services.

What You’ll Do

As a key member of the data team at LayerZero, you'll be diving headfirst into the world of crypto data - exploring on-chain wallets and contracts, block and transaction data, insights from in-house systems, and third-party intelligence. Your mission will be to combine these diverse datasets into rich, actionable data products for a broad group of stakeholders.


Leveraging and expanding our ever-growing Kimball dimensional model.
Writing SQL to create and expand insights in our in-house reporting solutions.
Collaborating with stakeholders across the organization to conduct ad-hoc explorations and analytics - from engineering questions to help understand production issues to product insights that illuminate the broader crypto landscape.
Be a key owner of data quality, building out insights that serve the data team itself to help guide our data efforts towards cleaner and richer data.
Compose pipelines by writing SQL code to clean, combine, refine, and aggregate data into the insights the organization needs.
Collaborating on new datasets to ingest into our Snowflake data warehouse, working closely with data engineers on your team.
Not afraid of pushing code that supports tens of billions of dollars in daily transaction volume.


About You

We are looking for someone with previous data analyst experience. Likely with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Physics or related field, but we also consider and highly value equivalent practical experience.

Required


Strong SQL knowledge and experience
Proven track record in data modeling, statistics, and analytics
Experience working with a broad range of stakeholders
Strong convictions weakly held.
You enjoy working in a fast-paced start-up environment, where you'll need to take initiative and solve problems independently.
You understand the importance of data quality through incremental data development.


Bonus


Experience with general programming, we use Python and Go on the data stack
Experience with Snowflake
Experience building DAG based data pipelines
Experience with streaming real-time data pipelines
Previous experience with blockchain technologies, smart contracts, and decentralized finance
Experience with Kimball dimensional modeling
Working on a mid-to-large scale data stacks

Requirements


Proven experience in data engineering, with expertise in ETL processes, cloud platforms (e.g., GCP, AWS), and tools like Apache Airflow, SQL, and Python.
Strong knowledge of blockchain fundamentals, including smart contracts, decentralized applications, and protocol types.
Familiarity with Web3 metrics, such as transaction volume, TVL (Total Value Locked), staking, and protocol usage data.
Excellent ability to collaborate across cross-functional teams, including data science, product, and engineering.
Passion for Web3, blockchain, and decentralized ecosystems.


Join our team to craft the data backbone of Chainlink’s public narrative, providing the Web3 community with the insights they need to understand and trust the value of decentralized systems!

Chainlink Labs is the primary contributing developer of Chainlink, the decentralized computing platform powering the verifiable web. Chainlink is the industry-standard platform for providing access to real-world data, offchain computation, and secure cross-chain interoperability across any blockchain. Chainlink Labs helps power verifiable applications for banking, DeFi, global trade, and gaming by collaborating with some of the world’s largest financial institutions, notably Swift, DTCC, and ANZ. Chainlink Labs also works with top Web3 teams, including Aave, Compound, GMX, Maker, and Synthetix. Chainlink Labs was ranked in Newsweek’s 100 Most Loved Workplaces 2023 in both the United States and United Kingdom.

Chainlink Labs is pioneering the world’s first fully sustainable and decentralized oracle network, and the Economics team is searching for a Senior Analyst to play a critical role in building it. This role will sit at the intersection of blockchain technology, financial innovation, and economic systems, and shape the future of decentralized economics.

As a Senior Analyst, you will combine economics, data science, and blockchain expertise to shape incentives, optimize network design, and influence the decision-making of our Economics and Executive Leadership teams.

You will collaborate across departments to bring innovative solutions from concept to production, ensuring economic soundness and scalability throughout.

This is a high-impact role, offering visibility and influence as you contribute to the development of the Chainlink network. If you’re a meticulous, creative, and motivated individual ready to solve complex economic problems through data-driven decisions in the rapidly evolving world of Web3, this is the role for you.

Your Impact

Designing novel mechanisms and incentive schemes
Building models and simulations to evaluate investment opportunities
Designing and parameterizing trading systems
Optimizing parameters for production applications
Contributing to the design of Economics programs and applications
You'll optimize network incentives and systems by engaging directly with the Economics, Product, Engineering, Research, and Data Science teams to understand network dynamics at the deepest level.
You'll operationalize processes and analytics systems, and coordinate cross-functionally to implement them.
This is both a highly technical and highly social role. You will have high visibility and a large impact on how Chainlink builds the world’s first fully sustainable decentralized oracle network.
