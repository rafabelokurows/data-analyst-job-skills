Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It’s where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most.

You’ll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Creating a life you love also means finding a career that celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences that you bring. As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

The Sales Strategy & Operations (SS&O) team partners with advertising sales leaders across sales strategy and analytics, operations and process and tools. Team members are experts in business strategy and operations and analytical and strategic thinking. They are pragmatic and results-oriented. As a Business Intelligence Analyst, you will focus on empowering sales leadership and the broader sales organization with self-serve access to data and insights. You’ll be responsible for designing, building and maintaining scaled sales analytics solutions (dashboards, data tables) for over one thousand internal users.

What You’ll Do


Collaborate with SS&O team members and sales leaders to define key business metrics and gather requirements for which insights should be made available at scale. Architect data pipelines, design and build new Tableau dashboards for stakeholders to use to address their needs. Maintain and improve existing sales data infrastructure and Tableau dashboards based on evolving business requirements.
Democratize sales data by enabling self-serve access to key business drivers, trends and operating metrics. Design fully automated dashboards that are easy to understand, enable self-serve access for the sales org, and can be used by a broad audience with a variety of use cases.
Publish and maintain clear documentation to inform and educate users at scale, gather feedback to identify opportunities for improvement.
Identify ways to streamline and improve the efficiency of our data. Implement changes to our infrastructure (optimize SQL queries and data workflows) to improve the landing time of our data.
Work with cross-functional teams including Sales, Strategic Finance, and Business Intelligence to identify data needs and gaps, and align on solutions.
Lead projects end to end, see around corners and provide thought partnership to your team.



What We’re Looking For


3+ years of professional experience in highly analytical environments such as management consulting, investment banking, corporate strategy or technology/media companies.
Understanding of sales and digital advertising platforms and working knowledge of sales systems and tools (Salesforce).
Strong data analytics and business intelligence skills - querying large data sets with advanced SQL, building visualizations with Tableau. Experience building and maintaining data pipelines (authoring, scheduling, monitoring workflows).
Ability to visualize complex data sets that provide insights and clearly inform areas of action.
Passion for building new solutions and enabling analysis at scale to drive decision-making.
Experience in a complex, fast-paced environment.
Organized, detail-oriented and strategically focused.
Strong written and verbal communication skills.
Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as business administration, or equivalent experience.



Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement


We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.
This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 1-2 times/month and therefore needs to be in a commutable distance from the NY office.



At Pinterest we believe the workplace should be equitable, inclusive, and inspiring for every employee. In an effort to provide greater transparency, we are sharing the base salary range for this position. The position is also eligible for equity. Final salary is based on a number of factors including location, travel, relevant prior experience, or particular skills and expertise.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Processing data is our core business. We use data to develop, train, and implement models while creating a deeper understanding of business processes for our clients. We believe that data should never be processed in isolation or without the proper context. That’s why we provide contextual analytics—taking into account what the data represents, rather than just analyzing numbers or text stored in a file or database.

And yes, we also develop and train AI/ML models, but only if they add value to what our clients expect from us.

Role

As a Junior Analyst, you will work closely with senior analysts and managers to collect, process, and define data for various projects. This involves conducting detailed data analyses to determine data quality, performing fit-for-purpose assessments, and designing and implementing data pipelines.

To ensure high-quality and meaningful results, you will continuously validate outputs and underlying assumptions. This is achieved by reviewing relevant documentation and discussing findings with internal or client subject matter experts.

Key Responsibilities:

Extract, process, and classify data from structured sources
Develop models to extract data from unstructured sources
Build models to forecast (financial) metrics
Create key metrics to identify patterns and insights
Develop dashboards for (senior) management
Define implementation strategies for productionizing analyses

What We Offer

We value individual contributions and encourage professional growth. We enjoy working together and learning from each other. Our clients benefit from our expertise, and our colleagues develop as professionals.

Our assignments are challenging and diverse, meaning no two days, projects, or clients are the same.

Benefits:

Competitive salary with a bonus scheme
Hybrid & flexible working options, plus 30 vacation days
A young, dynamic, and diverse team with passion and ambition
Two additional leave days per year for volunteering
Choice of a company car or public transport card
Laptop, phone, and internet allowance (also for personal use)

Your Profile

We are looking for ambitious individuals with a strong understanding of mathematics and its applications. You should have an intrinsic drive to learn and understand business processes, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret data in a meaningful way.

Education:

Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Economics, or Quantitative Finance

Required Skills:

Basic programming knowledge (Python, R, SQL)
Ability to design and implement mathematical models
Strong foundation in statistical analysis

Develop and maintain ETL (extract, transform, load) processes to ensure data quality and integrity.
Develop, maintain, and update Power BI dashboards containing customer metrics and KPIs used by various internal stakeholders.
Educating teams on data-informed decision-making and advocating the work of the data team across the business







What will you bring?

Our culture is the result of our behaviors, our personal commitments, our willingness to collaborate, listen and learn. If you recognize yourself in our values, you will feel at home at Paula’s Choice:

In fact, we’re the largest and fastest-growing automotive marketplace, and we’ve been profitable for over 15 years.

What We Do

The market is evolving, and we are too, moving the entire automotive journey online and guiding our customers through every step. That includes everything from the sale of an old car to the financing, purchase, and delivery of a new one. Today, tens of millions of consumers visit CarGurus.com each month, and ~30,000 dealerships use our products. But they're not the only ones who love CarGurus—our employees do, too.
