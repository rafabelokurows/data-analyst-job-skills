Agreena is an exciting, dynamic, and purpose-oriented organisation united in a mission to mobilise farmers and corporations to unlock the value of nature and help restore the planet. While we’re rooted in agriculture, finance, and technology, our team of experts range from soil carbon scientists and software developers to market strategists and regulatory affairs experts. Over 230 employees across more than 40 nationalities are gathered under the common Agreena flag – either working from our headquarters in Copenhagen, offices in London, or remotely across Europe.

As a rapidly scaling climate agtech, Agreena provides solutions that drive both environmental and financial sustainability in farming. We have helped farmers across 20 countries in their journey from conventional agriculture to regenerative farming practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, storing it in soil. Our company offers a supportive and positive work environment with opportunities for learning, leading and growth no matter where you are in your professional journey. We believe in giving our employees a lot of responsibility, and we encourage new thinking, innovation and fun.

We are looking for an in-house statistician to assist our Programme and Data teams. Across both, we are looking to better understand and explain our data in order to bolster our scientific rigour. You will sit between both teams and should be confident working with different types of statistical analysis, process-based modelling, and sampling/stratification.

Equally, you should have a good understanding of statistical modelling and bring a fresh perspective to our machine learning and process-based approaches. Thus, you will be a strong communicator capable of translating complex analysis into simplified insights to both internal and external stakeholders.

The Programme and Data teams are integral to the scientific operations of the company, and you will work closely together with them and our Product teams to ensure state of the art science drives our world leading carbon platform. As such, you will be part of a dynamic and high-paced work environment constantly subject to innovation.

How Will You Make An Impact


Estimating uncertainty and error propagation in our models;
Applying Bayesian methods for the calibration of complex process-based models;
Designing sampling strategies for our data collection campaigns;
Evaluating the quality and quantity of our data;
Communicating and visualising key insights;


Who We’re Looking For


Self-driven individual capable of collaborating in a multi-disciplinary environment;
Minimum Bachelors in Statistics, Mathematics, or appropriate science/engineering field;
3+ years of experience working in a relevant field, with experience in some or all of the following:
Statistical and data-sampling techniques such as regression, imputation, random forest, Monte Carlo, stratification, and/or clustering;
Working with temporal and spatial data;
Experience coding in R;
Strong scientific writing, report creation and communication skills to audiences with a range of technical expertise.


Bonus Points If You Have


Masters or PhD in one of the relevant Science fields mentioned above;
A baseline understanding of greenhouse gas accounting frameworks and methodologies;
Strong theoretical background in Bayesian Statistics;
Knowledge or experience working with crop, pedometrics, or process-based models;
Experience coding in Python;
Handling unstructured/imbalanced data.


What’s In It For You


A unique opportunity to join and help shape a fast-growing tech scale up with the determination and ambitious mission to reverse climate change;
A truly global environment where you can collaborate and socialise with diverse and passionate colleagues;
Competitive compensation package and holidays;
Centrally located modern office in Copenhagen or London and the option to work from home a couple days a week;
Team events throughout the year;
An exciting purpose-led culture and mission;
Open communication and supportive feedback culture.

About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of 220 people and 37 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

Our small Canadian-born business was founded in 1978 and has become a global organization that now spans 120 locations across 20 countries. Our expansion has been rapid, but what matters most is the common belief that drives all 5,000 of our people to be a different type of real estate organization. We believe that the places in which we live, work and play have the power to make us happier and healthier, and we are united by a shared sense of purpose, to have a positive impact on people’s lives. In short, we are a global commercial real estate advisory firm with a simple aim: for real estate to play a leading role in creating vibrant buildings, cities and places that deliver long-lasting social value and economic impact.

Why Work For Us

We believe that our industry is changing, and we want our business to be a melting pot of curious minds, passionate hearts and strategic intelligence. Your gender, religion and race are all highly respected, but are less important to us than your ability to step up and change the game. We provide you with a place where you can do just that, with like-minded people. Collaboration is embedded in the way we work – our people have the autonomy to collaborate on client relationships, engage teams across the business, lead operations, work collectively on projects, participate in strategy and are ultimately responsible for our growth. Our distinctive Principal-led, privately-owned model puts us in the enviable position of being able to offer every employee the opportunity to own a share of our business and inspires and allows anyone to become a Principal.

This could not be a better time to join Octopus Energy. We are already recognised as a global leader in the fight to decarbonise the planet by revolutionising what’s possible in energy - including investments in renewable energy supply, renewable energy generation, smart energy networks, EVs, heat pumps, etc. The government's new green initiatives and the recent investment by Al Gore’s Generation Fund will propel us further and faster.

There has never been a more important moment to join our credit risk team. The energy sector is going through a period of once-in-a-generation volatility. Businesses and households are facing higher energy prices than they ever have before. For these reasons we are looking to add to our credit risk team with this new role. This team sits at the heart of everything we do to support customers that are struggling with their bills. We’re unique because we are genuinely a hybrid of a few different skills and mindsets:

1. Data analytics is our core skillset. Everyone in the team is very strong in this area

2. We have a firm understanding of the needs of our customers and the business

3. We work closely with the tech team, because we’re a tech company, so this how we solve customer problems, efficiently at scale


We work closely with our operations teams who are the people that speak directly to customers



What You'll Do


Take ownership of our management of customers who are struggling with their payments
Deep dive investigations into data in order to surface insight for decision making

40% of all food produced in the world is wasted. And that has a huge impact on the health of our planet, with 10% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from food waste.

We’re more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation with a mission to empower everyone to take action against food waste, so alongside our marketplace app, we create educational tools, explore new business solutions - such as our Retail Technologies offering, and influence legislation to help reduce food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 113 million registered users and 240,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 419+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.132.000 tonnes of CO2e!

Your mission

We are seeking a talented and driven Data Analyst to join us in shaping the future of our newly established Demand Analytics team. The successful candidate will play a pivotal role in enhancing our team's capabilities around Marketing analytics while benefiting from a robust support structure designed to foster growth and innovation. We are also ready to consider candidates with more work experience as Senior Data Analyst.

As a Marketplace, Marketing is one of Too Good To Go’s most powerful levers for driving demand. Consequently, a strong foundation in marketing metrics is essential for this role. The models and methodologies you will help develop are largely marketing-focused, emphasizing the importance of experience with causal impact modeling and econometric modeling.

That said, Demand Analytics at Too Good To Go extends beyond Marketing. We are looking for someone who can also contribute to broader analytical initiatives, such as demand forecasting and other data-driven projects.

If you’re passionate about leveraging analytics to make a real-world impact and thrive in a dynamic, collaborative environment, we’d love to hear from you.

Your role

Provide data-driven guidance to business leaders on key strategic decisions
Design and deliver self-service tools to various functional groups for operational excellence
Collaborate with marketing teams to optimize campaign strategies and resource allocation based on data-driven insights
Conduct in-depth analyses to identify the drivers of demand and measure marketing impact
Utilize marketing insights to inform and enhance demand forecasting models


Requirements


You have an understanding of Marketing Data and KPIs, or a strong appetite to learn this space.
Having experience in analyzing and interpreting marketing performance metrics would be a clear advantage.
You are a great communicator and storyteller - someone who enjoys helping non-technical audiences see what you see in the numbers!
You have hands-on experience working closely with senior stakeholders, ideally within Marketing, to deliver data-driven insights.
You are skilled in designing, executing, and interpreting A/B tests, as well as applying causal inference and impact modeling techniques.
You have econometric modeling experience; familiarity with marketing mix models (MMM) is a plus.
You are proficient in SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and transformation
You have Python expertise for data pre-processing, or statistical analysis. R would also be considered.
You are passionate about data literacy, continuously striving to improve your own skills and those of your team.


Our values


We win together: Food waste is a big beast to fight. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: We always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: Our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple.
We build a legacy: We’re proud of the change we’re driving.
We care: We always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.


What We Have To Offer


An opportunity to work in a global social-impact company and certified B Corporation! where you can see a real and tangible impact in your role.
To be an integral part of our Data & Analytics team. We are eager for you to make an impact and contribute to the role of analytics across key decisions and our solution processes. Your insights are valuable, and we are here to listen.
Work-life balance is important to us! Focus on the job to be done, not the hours spent, there is no need for overtime.
We trust in our employees and encourage an autonomous environment that provides several opportunities for employees to contribute, develop and take ownership of their work in a way that works for them.
To be part of an international company, with over 1,300+ colleagues across 19 countries that are on the same important mission.

Communicate complex data findings to non-technical stakeholders


And... we are a bank so risk is a part of everything we do. We love people who take responsibility, do the right thing for customers, colleagues and Metro Bank and have the ability to call out any concerns.

What you will need: 


Understand the risks associated with your job and what that means for you, Metro Bank and all our stakeholders
Familiarity with data visualisation platforms like Power BI, Tableau, QlikView etc
Experience working with large complex data sets
Proficiency in data analysis tools such as SQL, Alteryx, R, Python, SAS or similar programming languages

Diverse teams really are the best teams. We know that candidates (especially women, research tells us) may be put off applying for a job unless they can tick every box. We also know that ‘normal’ office hours aren’t always doable, and while we can’t accommodate every flexible working request we are happy to be asked. So if you are excited about working with us and think you can do much of what we are looking for but aren’t sure if you are 100% there yet… why not give it a whirl?

What You'll Do


Take ownership of our management of customers who are struggling with their payments
Deep dive investigations into data in order to surface insight for decision making

Develop our empathic approaches towards vulnerable customers
Create strategies to identify and prevent first party and third party fraud
Develop our machine learning models & policies that drive sophisticated decisions

2-5 years experience of consumer credit risk or collections in the financial services, utilities or telecommunications industries

Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists, and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you’ll do

About The Internship Experience

Our internship program provides the opportunity to work on meaningful business initiatives that will grow the GDP of the internet. Through the internship, you will work with many systems and technologies, gain experience in working with large datasets and analytical methodologies/tools to help us better understand our users and build better products.

Each intern has a dedicated mentor, and every intern project is part of the team's roadmap that will directly contribute to Stripe's mission. As you collaborate with industry experts on initiatives that expand global commerce, you will develop a strong first-hand understanding of the role analytics plays in steering business strategy and results.

We're not just focused on your immediate contributions; we're invested in your growth. Stripe sees this internship as an opportunity to grow your technical expertise and facilitate personal development, preparing you for a career in the tech industry.

Responsibilities

You will:


Partner closely with Data Scientists, Data Analysts, and business partners to drive business impact through rigorous analytical solutions
Apply machine learning, causal inference, or advanced analytics on large datasets to: i) measure results and outcomes, ii) identify causal impact and attribution, iii) predict the future performance of users or products, to drive business success
Influence business actions and strategy by developing actionable insights through metrics and dashboards.
Drive the collection of new data and the refinement of existing data sources.
Learn quickly by asking great questions, finding how to work with your mentor and teammates effectively, and communicating the status of your work clearly

Who you are

Minimum Requirements

Enrolled in a quantitative Master's program (e.g. Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, Statistics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2025 or spring/summer 2026
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Experience communicating and collaborating with multidisciplinary stakeholders in a team environment



Preferred Qualifications

You also likely have:


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $135,200 - $135,200. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Let’s kick things off with a quick intro. Jane is a team that’s all about fostering growth, spreading delight, and serving our healthcare community. We’re looking for people who are ready to jump in and join us as we simplify the lives of healthcare practitioners and patients every day.

At Jane, success means collaborating with your team, delivering an aligned result with efficiency and quality, communicating clearly and openly, and embracing continuous improvement. And guess what? Jane is a remote-first company, so every role, including this one, gives you the freedom to work from anywhere in Canada.

Your Role In Our Journey

Jane is looking for a Data Analyst who will be responsible for delivering consistent, meaningful insights across the company with a focus on supporting our Product and Marketing teams. You will have strong experience with SQL, dbt, Looker and preferably experience in a fast growing software company. We're looking for someone who thrives in a fast-paced environment, enjoys working with stakeholders to solve business problems, and is excited about working with data that drives business impact. You’ll have the opportunity to shape how Jane uses data to improve product adoption, customer retention, and marketing efficiency. At Jane, we value transparency, ownership, and a problem-solving mindset. If you’re excited about working with data to unlock business insights and help shape decision-making, this could be the perfect role for you.

Learn More About Us

We're founder-led, which means we live our values while maintaining a clear vision for the future. Our product enables the likes of physiotherapists, mental health counsellors, chiropractors, and other allied health practitioners to run their practices in a digital-first way through features such as online booking, charting, scheduling, telehealth, secure payments and billing along with an evolving library of features. You can see more of them here .

We're a company that is growing rapidly, and with that comes the challenge of navigating an environment with many moving parts, often without a clear-cut path laid out in front of us. If you're the kind of person who gets a kick out of being resourceful and loves solving problems, we would love to hear from you.

No doubt, Jane's a special place to work. There is autonomy and flexibility to help integrate work into your life in a way that makes sense for you. Need to block out time to pick up the kids? Go for it. That's normal here. And yes, we have a Slack channel for parents, but we've also got channels dedicated to plants, furry friends, food, pride, wellness - you get the idea! While we love to connect virtually, the Jane team also connects in person throughout the year.

We believe in collaboration, humility, and keeping a growth mindset. We're looking for people who can embrace our way of working, which often means being flexible and open to change. So, if after reading this, you feel excited about the opportunity — all in the name of helping those who help others — reach out to us to learn more.

Compensation Expectations For The Role

Jane’s committed to paying our team members fairly, clearly, and above all, paying for growth. This role has a minimum annual salary of $75,200 and maximum annual salary of $112,800. As you may have noticed, this salary range is quite large, and this is intentional to account for the growth someone will experience in the role throughout their time at Jane (i.e., from building the skills, to accomplished, to highly proficient, all the way to achieving excellence in the role). When hiring talented folks to join the Jane team, we’ve found that new team members are best set up for success when hired with the expectation of being fully accomplished in the role, which for this role would reflect a starting salary of $89,300.

It's also possible to join Jane at a salary above or below this, which would mean a salary below $89,300 typically reflects someone who has all the potential to be fully accomplished in the role but doesn't yet possess all the skills required, while a salary above $89,300 is typically for individuals who are currently in this role at Jane and had the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on our customers, product and company with deep Jane knowledge. At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.

Paying clearly is one of our compensation fundamentals to help folks build trust in the compensation process at Jane. To better understand Jane’s compensation fundamentals and how this range is determined, click on this link here for a short video walkthrough of how it all works! We also welcome you to ask as many questions as you’d like about compensation throughout the interview process to ensure you feel confident and build trust through the process.

At Jane, we’re committed to fostering an environment that allows you to come to work as your truest self. We believe it’s important to actively recognize, embrace, and celebrate our differences in order to make Jane an inclusive, equitable, and diverse workplace.

We want to build a team of people who make conversations rich with perspective and experience. We are committed to listening to every voice in order to learn and grow because doing this will allow us to meet the needs of the diverse community of helpers that Jane serves.

We do not tolerate discrimination, prejudice, or oppressive isms of any kind. Employment is decided on the basis of qualifications, merit, experience, and the needs of the Jane community. We encourage anyone who requires accommodation or adjustments throughout the interview process to let us know, and we will do our best to support you.

So why — despite the huge leaps we've taken in design and usability — does most business phone software still look, feel, and act like it was born in the 90s? OpenPhone is changing that.

We’re a new type of business phone with a mission to help people communicate better and be more productive.

We’re backed by Y Combinator and some of the best venture firms around including Tiger Global, Craft Ventures, Slow Ventures, and others. We take pride in providing an exceptional customer experience and a product people love, which is why we’re excited that our customers have rated us the #1 VoIP Provider on G2.

OpenPhone is the modern, sophisticated answer to the clunky, outdated phone systems that have been slowing down businesses for years. With thousands of happy customers and several rounds of funding in just five years, it's safe to say we're onto something big.

About The Role

We are hiring a Data Analyst with 4+ years of experience to primarily support our Go-To-Market (GTM) teams by providing insights and reporting to drive strategic decision-making. The ideal candidate will have strong analytical skills, experience with SQL, BI reporting tools, and a passion for translating data into actionable business insights. Experience in SaaS environments and familiarity with key SaaS metrics is highly desirable.

Some Of The Things You’ll Do


Develop and maintain dashboards and reports using BI tools (e.g., Mode, Tableau) to support GTM teams.
Analyze marketing, advertising, and sales data, including conversion funnel and cohort retention analyses, slicing data by attribution models, and providing customer lifecycle insights.
Collaborate with stakeholders across sales, marketing, and customer success to define key metrics and reporting needs.
Write efficient SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data from various sources.
Assist in data modeling and transformation using dbt (a plus but not required).
Comfortable with working large and complex data coming from multiple sources such as Kafka events or web traffic data from ad platforms.
Communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Ensure data accuracy, integrity, and security in all reporting and analysis efforts.


About You


4+ years of experience in data analysis, preferably in a SaaS environment.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills with a quantitative mindset.
Familiarity with analytics engineering and dbt (a plus).
Excellent communication skills with the ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical audiences.
Ability to thrive in a high-paced, high-growth environment.
Experience managing data projects and collaborating with cross-functional teams.

SF Bay Area, Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Boston, New York, and Washington, DC Metro: $158,000 - $176,000 USD

Salary is just one component of OpenPhone’s total compensation package. Your total rewards package will include equity, extensive medical coverage, a monthly lifestyle stipend, and a flexible PTO policy.

And remember, there's no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. We're looking for optimists with grit and determination, who are excited to face the challenges of a growing startup.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

What you’ll do

About The Internship Experience

Our internship program provides the opportunity to work on meaningful business initiatives that will grow the GDP of the internet.

Airports are one of the most important, impactful, and complex parts of Lyft’s Rideshare business, as they are a key part of both the rider and driver Lyft experience and have unique dynamics. Scheduled rides allow riders to book a ride in advance with high reliability, and enable drivers to add structure to their work schedule. Lastly, events such as concerts or sporting games require similar considerations of special operations to ensure a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.

How are riders and drivers using different ride modes at airports and events, and how do we design products to address this behavior?
How are riders and drivers discovering scheduled rides and are there entry point optimizations we can implement?


Responsibilities:


Leverage data and analytic frameworks to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency across Verticals products, recommending solutions to drive business impact
Understand the complex business dynamics across the Verticals product areas, specifically how these products differ from traditional rideshare marketplaces, to propose enhancements that compliment Lyft-wide products
Partner with product managers, engineers, marketers, designers, and operators to translate data insights into decisions and action
Develop dashboards and analytical frameworks to monitor business and product performance
Establish metrics that measure the health of our products, the business, as well as the rider and driver experiences

5-7+ years of experience in data analytics in a high-growth environment
Degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, economics, applied math, operations research or engineering (an asset, advanced degrees also an asset)
End-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, analysis, and visualization
Ability to manage, influence, negotiate, and inspire others in a fast-moving environment
Proficient in SQL and quantitative analysis, you can deep dive into large amounts of data, draw meaningful insights, dissect business issues and draw actionable conclusions
Outcome-driven approach to developing recommendations and demonstrated ability to develop a story and execution plan to support goals and objectives
Exceptional communication (listening, written, and oral) skills with the ability to present findings and recommendations targeted to the audience in question.
A drive to understand the core issues along with the determination to uncover the solution

Imagine if there was something we could all change today that would reduce global warming by 10%. That’s how much food waste contributes to the climate crisis, and yet we continue to waste edible food all over the world.

As the world’s largest food waste-fighting app, we connect stores that have unsold, surplus food with consumers who buy and enjoy it. But we’re more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation and our mission is to inspire and empower everyone to take action against food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 115 million registered users and 241,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 427+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.153.000 tonnes of CO2e!

This role can be based in New York City or Toronto.

Your mission

We are looking for a Data Analytics Business Partner to strengthen our knowledge around how to drive excellence in Operations.

While you will report directly to the Director of Analytics, you will be embedded in the Operational Leadership team for our North American markets. Your mission will be to work as a trusted advisor to our Vice President of Operations in driving key strategic decisions with a data-driven approach, mapping strategy to data-driven ways of working, and championing data literacy across your operational area. You will be 1 of 6 in a similar role, each dedicated to an Operational Leadership team, working together to share cross-country insights in an efficient and scalable way.

Generate new ideas for how to leverage the data we have to drive operational excellence in our North American markets
Drive the measurement and design for the North American Operations test & learn agenda
Opportunity size and prioritise analytics ideas and questions in our North American markets, with the support of your Vice President of Operations
Elevate the data literacy across the North American team
Proactively bring relevant & actionable insights from the rest of the Analytics team (embedded in other areas of the organisation) to the North American team
Identify, advocate, and build opportunities for scale and automation across the Analytics team
Elevate our Global Analytics specialisation by sharing best practices and learnings and offering ad-hoc guidance to other team members on their projects


Requirements


You demonstrate business acumen through significant experience in an analytical role supporting 2 or more of the following functions: Sales, Marketing, Operations, Finance, Strategy, Business Operations, Leadership; or relevant work experience in Consulting
You are proficient in SQL, comfortable with Python or R, and proficient in manipulating data efficiently for ad-hoc analysis
You are experienced with Data Visualization tools like Looker, Tableau, PowerBI or similar
You are focused on business outcomes by framing insights in a way that inspires action
You are comfortable describing statistical uncertainty and educating non-technical audiences on how best to interpret and action off of new insights
You have proven experience in stakeholder management, with the ability to manage a high influx of requests in a structured way
You are driven by the “why” behind the work that you do, always eager to ask an extra question to make sure you’re solving for the right thing
You have a proactive mindset and work well in a team environment
You have the ability to communicate effectively and convincingly in an English-speaking organisation
Previous experience in a hyper growth start-up environment will be valued


Our values


We win together: Food waste is a big beast to fight. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: We always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: Our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple.
We build a legacy: We’re proud of the change we’re driving.
We care: We always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.


What We Offer


A rare opportunity to work in a social impact company (and certified B Corp) where you can see real and tangible impact in your role.
Working alongside an international community of users, partners and 1,300+ colleagues across 19 countries that are on the same important mission.
Personal and professional development opportunities in a fast-paced scale-up environment.
An inclusive company culture where you can bring your authentic self to work
A strong, values-driven team culture where we celebrate successes and socialize with colleagues that care to offer


Benefits
