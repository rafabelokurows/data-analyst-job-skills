What You’ll Do


Collaborate with SS&O team members and sales leaders to define key business metrics and gather requirements for which insights should be made available at scale. Architect data pipelines, design and build new Tableau dashboards for stakeholders to use to address their needs. Maintain and improve existing sales data infrastructure and Tableau dashboards based on evolving business requirements.

Work with cross-functional teams including Sales, Strategic Finance, and Business Intelligence to identify data needs and gaps, and align on solutions.
Lead projects end to end, see around corners and provide thought partnership to your team.



What We’re Looking For


3+ years of professional experience in highly analytical environments such as management consulting, investment banking, corporate strategy or technology/media companies.

Job Summary

The Research Data Analyst functions as a statistical analyst for the UCSF Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy, and Sleep Medicine supporting divisional principal investigators. The Research Data Analyst will primarily be responsible for developing and conducting complex statistical analyses and providing database development and management.

The Research Data Analyst is specifically tailored to work on exposure-related lung diseases. The lung is constantly exposed to various environmental pollutants, allergens, and toxins, which interact with airways and alveoli and result in inflammation, injury, and disease. The specific laboratory that houses this position is focused on the paradigm that respiratory exposures to pollutants and toxicants contribute to development and progression of chronic lung diseases, and may further yield systemic effects well beyond lungs. Under this paradigm, the research activities have focused on understanding the physiologic and immunologic mechanisms via which environmental exposures contribute to chronic lung diseases and how knowledge of these mechanisms could be translated to ways to better define, prognosticate, and manage disease burden at both individual and societal levels.

The Research Data Analyst will use skills as an experienced research professional with an in-depth understanding of biostatistics and research software programming techniques to oversee and conduct the statistical component of new and ongoing protocols. The analyst will work closely with research team members (e.g., principal investigators, research managers, trainees, CRCs, etc.) to support the conduct of the research. The individual will help manage, analyze, interpret, and report on statistical findings. Specifically, the individual will conduct complex statistical analyses and prepare findings for presentation at professional meeting and publication in medical journals.


NOTE: This is a part-time (50%) Contract role for 1 year.


The final salary and offer components are subject to additional approvals based on UC policy.

Your placement within the salary range is dependent on a number of factors including your work experience and internal equity within this position classification at UCSF. For positions that are represented by a labor union, placement within the salary range will be guided by the rules in the collective bargaining agreement.

The salary range for this position is $87,900 - $126,900 (Annual Rate).

Provide the “source of truth” for internal consumers by owning critical analytical reporting and building exploratory dashboards.
Collaborate with the rest of the data organization at Strava (Machine Learning, Data Platform, etc) to collectively improve our technological craftsmanship.



We're excited about you because:


You have 2+ years of experience in analytics, data science, or other quantitative domains, preferably in consumer-facing tech
You are a clear communicator with an orientation towards impact, and you are comfortable working both multi-functionally and independently.
You have a deep understanding of data pipeline concepts (e.g. ETL, scripting common analysis workflows).
You are highly proficient with SQL and have experience with Business Intelligence tools (e.g. Tableau).
You have hands-on experience working with statistical programming languages (e.g. R, Python) for data wrangling and modeling.
You are comfortable managing concurrent projects and meeting goals, even in the context of competing deadlines or priorities.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

The Role

Square is looking for a Data Analyst to join the Seller Customer Success Operations team to help build the strategy by providing data insights around customer satisfaction, team happiness, and operational efficiency.

As a member of the team, you will lead experimentation initiatives, develop automation solutions, run analysis and summarize insights from the vast amount of data captured by Square, and guide strategic decisions based on data to improve the performance of our organization.

You Will


Partner with stakeholders throughout the organization to facilitate data-informed decision-making by leveraging analytics
Utilize a variety of strategies, including statistical analysis and quantitative reasoning, to address challenges, conduct research, and generate actionable insights
Independently manage, coordinate, and resolve intricate problems through data-driven analysis
Communicate analysis and decisions to high-level partners and executives in verbal, visual, and written media
Provide comprehensive daily analytics support to partner teams, develop resources to empower data access and self-service so your expertise can be used where it is most impactful
Contribute in strategic analytical projects that provide relevant insights or promote operational change


You Have


5 years of analytical experience in consulting, data analytics, data science, or machine learning and predictive analytics
Bachelor's degree, with a major in analytics, statistics, finance, or data science field, or equivalent practical experience.
Advanced to expert level SQL proficiency
Experience with reporting and visualization platforms (e.g. Tableau, Looker)
Work experience with Python
Familiarity with statistics techniques to structure analyses and provide insights (e.g. statistical tests, AB testing)
Experience in applying data-backed heuristics to solve practical product problems such as predicting churn, cross selling, clustering user archetypes, and more is a plus

Powered by our H2Ok AI Co-pilot models and state-of-the-art sensors, our solutions optimize facility performance across various processes, including process manufacturing, production, water management, energy reduction, and waste minimization. Based at Greentown Labs, North America's premier cleantech innovation community, we're a woman-founded startup backed by renowned investors like Construct Capital, 2048 Ventures, and Flybridge Capital. Our groundbreaking technologies have earned accolades and adoption from industry giants like Unilever, The Coca-Cola Company, ABinBev, and Mitsubishi Electric. We're committed to unlocking untapped data for our customers, empowering them to gain a competitive edge and create Industry 4.0.

Transforming our most foundational sectors of society is hard. Very hard. But we’re building an empire. And empire building is not easy. It’s deeply fulfilling, and you will learn and grow tremendously while driving sustainable impact globally with some of the largest players that make everything we eat, use, and wear. Our culture is to foster extraordinary growth within our teammates. We believe in autonomy, ownership, empowerment, demanding excellence, being mission-driven.

Your responsibilities will look similar to those of a hands-on AI startup CTO where you will work cross-functionally in sales, customer success, and product delivery to own the delivery of high-impact projects to global clients. The ideal candidate is an excellent critical thinker, a clear and engaging communicator, and knows how to not only explain data, but how to tell a compelling story. Having a background in chemical engineering, process engineering, mechanical engineering, or computer science is a plus.

Develop and maintain ETL (extract, transform, load) processes to ensure data quality and integrity.
Develop, maintain, and update Power BI dashboards containing customer metrics and KPIs used by various internal stakeholders.
Educating teams on data-informed decision-making and advocating the work of the data team across the business







What will you bring?

Processing data is our core business. We use data to develop, train, and implement models while creating a deeper understanding of business processes for our clients. We believe that data should never be processed in isolation or without the proper context. That’s why we provide contextual analytics—taking into account what the data represents, rather than just analyzing numbers or text stored in a file or database.

And yes, we also develop and train AI/ML models, but only if they add value to what our clients expect from us.

Role

As a Junior Analyst, you will work closely with senior analysts and managers to collect, process, and define data for various projects. This involves conducting detailed data analyses to determine data quality, performing fit-for-purpose assessments, and designing and implementing data pipelines.

To ensure high-quality and meaningful results, you will continuously validate outputs and underlying assumptions. This is achieved by reviewing relevant documentation and discussing findings with internal or client subject matter experts.

Key Responsibilities:

Extract, process, and classify data from structured sources
Develop models to extract data from unstructured sources
Build models to forecast (financial) metrics
Create key metrics to identify patterns and insights
Develop dashboards for (senior) management
Define implementation strategies for productionizing analyses

What We Offer

We value individual contributions and encourage professional growth. We enjoy working together and learning from each other. Our clients benefit from our expertise, and our colleagues develop as professionals.

Our assignments are challenging and diverse, meaning no two days, projects, or clients are the same.

Benefits:

Competitive salary with a bonus scheme
Hybrid & flexible working options, plus 30 vacation days
A young, dynamic, and diverse team with passion and ambition
Two additional leave days per year for volunteering
Choice of a company car or public transport card
Laptop, phone, and internet allowance (also for personal use)

Your Profile

We are looking for ambitious individuals with a strong understanding of mathematics and its applications. You should have an intrinsic drive to learn and understand business processes, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret data in a meaningful way.

Education:

Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Economics, or Quantitative Finance

Required Skills:

Basic programming knowledge (Python, R, SQL)
Ability to design and implement mathematical models
Strong foundation in statistical analysis
