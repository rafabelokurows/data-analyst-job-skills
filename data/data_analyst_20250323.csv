Over 230 employees across more than 40 nationalities are gathered under the common Agreena flag – either working from our headquarters in Copenhagen, offices in London, or remotely across Europe.

As a rapidly scaling climate agtech, Agreena provides solutions that drive both environmental and financial sustainability in farming. We have helped farmers across 20 countries in their journey from conventional agriculture to regenerative farming practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, storing it in soil.

A unique opportunity to join and help shape a fast-growing tech scale up with the determination and ambitious mission to reverse climate change;
A truly global environment where you can collaborate and socialise with diverse and passionate colleagues;

About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of more than 240 employees from over 40 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

The company developed 5 apps and games that reached the #1 spot in the App Store across 3 continents.




Backed by some of the world's most esteemed investors, including Accel, Kevin Weil, Riccardo Zacconi, Scott Belsky, and Ilkka Paananen, SLAY is rapidly growing and reaching millions of users.




Our mission is to create digital life through AI and become the leading company for virtual friends that live, grow and evolve like humans—starting with Pengu. Pengu has become the biggest AI character app with its own IP in the US and Europe.


Tasks



Location: In-person working (Berlin). No remote/hybrid.


A-Players Only: We’re building a team of top-tier talent. A-players hire A-players. We’d rather invest in one exceptional person with an above-market salary they’re thrilled about than settle for multiple B-players at standard rates.


Drive: You’re relentless and motivated to do whatever it takes to succeed. You might have something to prove, a fire in your belly, or a mind that works differently. Work isn’t just a job—it’s a core part of who you are and how you find purpose.


Grind. We work/text on weekends and at night. It’s ok to send messages at 3am.


Urgency: Move at lightning speed—turn weeks into days, hours into minutes. Smash through obstacles to get results. Respond instantly, not eventually.


Relentless. Winning comes first.Follow up 10x a day if needed. Triple-text or call if someone’s ghosting you. Persistence is your superpower.


Fast Firing: We move on quickly from anyone who isn’t an A-player. You’ll need to be comfortable with this. Paid trials help us both figure out the fit upfront.


Mission-Driven: Our mission—“Becoming the leading company for virtual characters”—excites you. You’re here to make an impact.


Versatility: No task is beneath you. Wear many hats. No job is not your job.


EV-Based Decisions: We optimize for expected value, not comfort zones. No playing it safe with “good enough” choices.


Flat Structure: Flat company org. Titles reflect scope. No political promotion games.





If you’re an A-player ready to run hard and win big, this is your shot. Let’s build something extraordinary together.


Requirements



Strong expertise in SQL and experience with data analysis tools.


Proficiency in a programming language (e.g., Python or R).


Experience with predictive modeling techniques and forecasting LTV.


Familiarity with machine learning concepts and algorithms relevant to marketing analytics.


Strong knowledge of attribution models, including probabilistic and multi-touch models.


Familiarity with mobile attribution challenges like SKAdNetwork (SKAN).


Experience with cloud data warehouses is a plus.


Having product sense, eyes for the details is great


No product managers


0-1, early stage data experience is great


Passion and experience building consumer-facing products! We’d love to hear about apps you’ve made!

Getreu unserem Motto – People is what makes us us – sind uns deine nachhaltige Ausbildung und Weiterentwicklung, deine ausgeglichene Work-Life-Balance und deine Happiness sehr wichtig. Konkret stellen wir mit 32 Urlaubstagen, 60 % mobilem Arbeiten, bis zu 4 Wochen pro Jahr – im europäischen Ausland – der Möglichkeit remote zu arbeiten, Sabbatical und Überstundenausgleich sicher, dass dir im FUSE-Agentur-Leben nichts fehlt.

In unserem derzeit über 60-köpfigen Team sowie unseren Kund*innen haben wir unser perfektes Match bereits gefunden. Wenn du noch auf der Suche bist, bei „popkulturellem Relevanzmarketing“ neugierig wirst und für Social Media, Influencer Marketing oder Gaming & Esports brennst, dann lass uns zusammen loslegen! Denn : Action Creates Impact .

Dein Job

Als (Junior) Insights Analyst (mensch) bearbeitest du als Teil unseres Data und Analytics Teams in erster Linie die Anfragen unserer Kunden nach Social Media Reportings sowie Social Listening Analysen und beherrschst den Spagat zwischen analytischem und kreativem Denken, um die Kolleg:Innen in deinem und anderen Teams mit datenbasierten Insights zu Kundenmeinungen, Märkten, Zielgruppen, Marken und ihren Social Media-Umfeldern zu versorgen.

Dein Aufgabenbereich

Datenbeschaffung / Toolbedienung

Du bist präzise, schnell, zuverlässig und motiviert, wenn es um die manuelle Erfassung großer (Social Media)- Datenmengen geht, aber auch wissbegierig und begeisterungsfähig, dich diesbezüglich kontinuierlich mit Prozessoptimierung zu befassen, sowie dich in Tools und automatisierte Datenerfassungsprozesse und Methoden einzudenken, um immer bessere Lösungen zu finden.

Datenstrukturierung, Effiziente Datensammlung, Query Writing, Kategorisierung und Datendarstellung werden hier deine täglichen Begleiter.

Studiendurchführung

Von der (manchmal noch recht schwammigen) Fragestellung bis zum fertigen Analysebericht mit guten Insights und Handlungsempfehlungen ist es oft ein weiter aber spannender Weg. Der kann bald auch deiner sein, gemeinsam mit uns im Team.

Du hast ein sehr gutes Gespür für Sprache und Kommunikation? Nice, das brauchst du hier in mindestens dreierlei Hinsicht: Erstens, um aus den Aussagen und Briefings unserer Auftraggeber herausfiltern zu können, wie du ihnen am besten weiterhelfen kannst. Zweitens, wenn es darum geht, die Essenz von Konsumenten-Posts und Kommentaren auf Social Media zu verstehen, schließlich ist Inhaltanalyse unser Daily-Business. Und Drittens, um dann Deine Findings Zielgruppengerecht rüberzubringen - in Reports, in Meetings und bei Präsentationen.

Datenanalyse

Auswertungslogiken passend zu den gegebenen Fragestellungen und Erkenntnisinteressen erstellen, Dimensionierungen & Kategorisierungen für Inhaltsanalysen planen und entwickeln, Daten auszählen, filtern, darstellen, vergleichen, interpretieren, daraus kreative Idee und Empfehlungen ableiten. Das ist dein Playground. Deine Affinität zu Zahlen und Daten kannst du hier immer wieder beweisen. Ein stets strukturiertes Vorgehen und ein souveräner Umgang auch mit großen und komplexen Datenmengen, Statistiken und Zahlen sind für dich selbstverständlich.

Spezielle Social Media Analyse-Tools wirst Du ebenso (kennenlernen und) zum Einsatz bringen wie ganz viel Excel und das gute alte Powerpoint.

Das bringst du mit

Du kannst (erste) Erfahrung in der qualitativen und quantitativen Forschungsarbeit, sowie in der marketing- oder kundenorientierten Projektarbeit vorweisen und hast Lust dich im Bereich Social Media Analytics weiter auszutoben. Du hast, dank deines Studiums, einen kommunikations-, sozial- oder medienwissenschaftlichen Background und bringst Kenntnisse der Methoden im Bereich der quantitativen und qualitativen Marktforschung mit. Du hast neben den analytischen Fähigkeiten, auch ein Gespür für gute kreative Kommunikation und Lust, diese mitzuentwickeln. Du bist organisiert und selbständig, willst aber auch noch ständig ganz viel lernen und verstehst dich als Teamplayer, der immer auf Höhe des Zeitgeists ist und daraus neue Impulse für unsere Teams und Kunden ableitet. Außerdem hast Du sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse in Wort und Schrift, sehr gute MS Office Kenntnisse, insbesondere Excel und PowerPoint und bist im besten Fall mit Analytics Tools im Bereich Social Listening & Web Analytics vertraut.

Darum wir

Als Teil der FUSE erfährst du stets Rückenwind von deinem Team, arbeitest für Kunden - die unsere Werte „BOLD. TRUE. EASY. TOGETHER.“ leben und kannst aktiv Prozesse und Strukturen mitentwickeln. Denn ganz getreu unserem Wert TOGETHER setzen wir auf das Potential im Team. Neben unvergesslichen Events bieten wir dir viel Raum für persönliche und berufliche Weiterentwicklung.

40% of all food produced in the world is wasted. And that has a huge impact on the health of our planet, with 10% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from food waste.

We’re more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation with a mission to empower everyone to take action against food waste, so alongside our marketplace app, we create educational tools, explore new business solutions - such as our Retail Technologies offering, and influence legislation to help reduce food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 113 million registered users and 240,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 419+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.132.000 tonnes of CO2e!

The models and methodologies you will help develop are largely marketing-focused, emphasizing the importance of experience with causal impact modeling and econometric modeling.

That said, Demand Analytics at Too Good To Go extends beyond Marketing. We are looking for someone who can also contribute to broader analytical initiatives, such as demand forecasting and other data-driven projects.

If you’re passionate about leveraging analytics to make a real-world impact and thrive in a dynamic, collaborative environment, we’d love to hear from you.

Requirements


You have an understanding of Marketing Data and KPIs, or a strong appetite to learn this space.
Having experience in analyzing and interpreting marketing performance metrics would be a clear advantage.
You are a great communicator and storyteller - someone who enjoys helping non-technical audiences see what you see in the numbers!
You have hands-on experience working closely with senior stakeholders, ideally within Marketing, to deliver data-driven insights.
You are skilled in designing, executing, and interpreting A/B tests, as well as applying causal inference and impact modeling techniques.
You have econometric modeling experience; familiarity with marketing mix models (MMM) is a plus.
You are proficient in SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and transformation
You have Python expertise for data pre-processing, or statistical analysis. R would also be considered.
You are passionate about data literacy, continuously striving to improve your own skills and those of your team.


Our values


We win together: Food waste is a big beast to fight. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: We always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: Our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple.
We build a legacy: We’re proud of the change we’re driving.
We care: We always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.


What We Have To Offer


An opportunity to work in a global social-impact company and certified B Corporation! where you can see a real and tangible impact in your role.
To be an integral part of our Data & Analytics team. We are eager for you to make an impact and contribute to the role of analytics across key decisions and our solution processes. Your insights are valuable, and we are here to listen.
Work-life balance is important to us! Focus on the job to be done, not the hours spent, there is no need for overtime.
We trust in our employees and encourage an autonomous environment that provides several opportunities for employees to contribute, develop and take ownership of their work in a way that works for them.

A 2:1 degree or higher under your belt (although this isn't a prerequisite)
Strong problem solver – never afraid to get stuck into the detail to uncover insights.
A knack for numbers with the confidence to tackle and interpret large, complex data sets.
A level of attention to detail that will put us all to shame! You'll understand that your accuracy is critical for the correct setup of our digital channels.
Use your strong communication skills to manage both internal stakeholders (ensuring effective planning and briefing of campaigns and execution) and external stakeholders to build lasting relationships.
A demonstrable commercial understanding with the ability to value and prioritise work ruthlessly.
Proven analytical and Excel/Power BI skills to build and evaluate hypotheses using data, with exposure to AB testing.
Agile and scrappy – you are action biased, embrace uncertainty with the tenacity to see things through to the end.

Zero100 is a membership-based intelligence platform that connects, informs, and inspires the world’s most influential C-Level Operations & Supply Chain Officers – and their teams – to unlock the true potential of the AI and Digital Revolution for the lasting benefit of business and our planet. Our members use Zero100’s research and advisory services to shape their supply chain strategies, and they harness the power of our community to expand their thinking, challenge their assumptions, and accelerate progress on their most important digitisation and decarbonisation initiatives.




With a rapidly expanding headquarters in central London, we’re proud to be backed by leading investors and supported by an impressive list of founding members that includes Unilever, Google, The Estee Lauder Companies, and Volvo.




Position Summary

We are seeking a highly motivated Research Data Analyst to support our research analytics endeavours. This unique position offers the opportunity to work closely with both our data and research teams, pushing the boundaries of data exploration on research related to supply chain innovation, digitization, and decarbonization.




Note: This is a primarily office-based role (4 days per week in office and 1 day work from home per week). Candidates must have the right to work in the UK, though Tier 2 visa sponsorship is available for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements.




In this role, your primary focus will be explorative analysis, using strong analytical skills to frame the right questions and delve into data in search of emerging patterns. The data team will support you with data discovery, ingestion, and quality assurance, while you’ll use SQL and Python to self-serve from our internal SQL database, allowing for efficient and autonomous exploration, and follow your own curiosity to pursue new inputs for dataset creation. With the research team, you will write reports and prepare frameworks and deliverables aligned with our research agenda, while reserving a portion of your time to support customer engagements.




Key Responsibilities

Engage in hypothesis-driven explorative analysis to uncover new insights and answer questions around supply chain digitization and decarbonization.
Frame and refine data-focused questions that address strategic industry topics.
Over time, you'll play a role in mentoring junior team members, sharing best practices in hypothesis generation to help them approach data-driven questions with a strategic lens.
Independently query our internal SQL databases allowing you to self-serve and explore data without heavy dependencies on the data team.
Collaborate closely with data team members to identify, ingest, and prepare new datasets relevant to your research.
Conduct primary research on AI and other advanced technology implementations within the supply chain sector.
Visualize and present findings in ways that enhance understanding and support decision-making.
Work with Research Directors to shape insights into member-facing content, including keynotes at our conferences, and strategic reports.




Who you are

You are an experienced research analyst, research manager, or data analyst with a curiosity-driven, critically minded approach to research analytics. With 4-6 years of professional experience in this field, you have solid SQL skills and are adept at both identifying the right questions to ask and creating innovative ways to answer them, including developing proxies and leveraging unconventional data sources. You thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment and are excited by the challenge of uncovering new patterns and insights to drive industry-leading research.




Requirements

Basic proficiency in Python and SQL (BigQuery), with the ability to self-serve analysis queries and modify existing code for more complex and advanced data manipulation - preference given to candidates with more extensive skills.
Strong analytical mindset, with a talent for framing the right questions to drive meaningful explorative analysis.
Ability to visualize data effectively, ideally with experience in PowerBI or similar tools. Excel is a must.
Experience conducting exploratory analysis to derive insights from large, complex datasets.
Exceptional problem-solving skills to tackle multifaceted data questions and identifying new data sources.
Strong communication skills for explaining findings in research reports and discussions with cross-functional teams.
Ability to work both independently on explorative projects and collaboratively within a fast-paced environment.




Preferred Qualifications:

Exposure to data science, LLMs, or machine learning, especially in exploratory contexts.
Experience and/or interest in AI and its applications within supply chain.
Academic background or strong interest in supply chain or similar field.
Experience working with APIs.
Experience working in start-up and/or scale-up environments.




What we offer:

Competitive Salary
Private Healthcare
Enhanced pension/401k
Unlimited vacation policy
Enhanced parental leave
Life insurance

Our small Canadian-born business was founded in 1978 and has become a global organization that now spans 120 locations across 20 countries. Our expansion has been rapid, but what matters most is the common belief that drives all 5,000 of our people to be a different type of real estate organization. We believe that the places in which we live, work and play have the power to make us happier and healthier, and we are united by a shared sense of purpose, to have a positive impact on people’s lives. In short, we are a global commercial real estate advisory firm with a simple aim: for real estate to play a leading role in creating vibrant buildings, cities and places that deliver long-lasting social value and economic impact.

Why Work For Us

We believe that our industry is changing, and we want our business to be a melting pot of curious minds, passionate hearts and strategic intelligence.

Collaboration is embedded in the way we work – our people have the autonomy to collaborate on client relationships, engage teams across the business, lead operations, work collectively on projects, participate in strategy and are ultimately responsible for our growth. Our distinctive Principal-led, privately-owned model puts us in the enviable position of being able to offer every employee the opportunity to own a share of our business and inspires and allows anyone to become a Principal. This role carries voting rights, so our people have a very real say in the future direction and operation of our business.

40% of all food produced in the world is wasted. And that has a huge impact on the health of our planet, with 10% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from food waste.

We’re more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation with a mission to empower everyone to take action against food waste, so alongside our marketplace app, we create educational tools, explore new business solutions - such as our Retail Technologies offering, and influence legislation to help reduce food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 113 million registered users and 240,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 419+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.132.000 tonnes of CO2e!

Your mission

We are seeking a talented and driven Data Analyst to join us in shaping the future of our newly established Demand Analytics team. The successful candidate will play a pivotal role in enhancing our team's capabilities around Marketing analytics while benefiting from a robust support structure designed to foster growth and innovation. We are also ready to consider candidates with more work experience as Senior Data Analyst.

As a Marketplace, Marketing is one of Too Good To Go’s most powerful levers for driving demand. Consequently, a strong foundation in marketing metrics is essential for this role. The models and methodologies you will help develop are largely marketing-focused, emphasizing the importance of experience with causal impact modeling and econometric modeling.

That said, Demand Analytics at Too Good To Go extends beyond Marketing. We are looking for someone who can also contribute to broader analytical initiatives, such as demand forecasting and other data-driven projects.

If you’re passionate about leveraging analytics to make a real-world impact and thrive in a dynamic, collaborative environment, we’d love to hear from you.

Your role


Support business leaders in identifying the right KPIs to drive business performance
Provide data-driven guidance to business leaders on key strategic decisions
Design and deliver self-service tools to various functional groups for operational excellence
Collaborate with marketing teams to optimize campaign strategies and resource allocation based on data-driven insights
Conduct in-depth analyses to identify the drivers of demand and measure marketing impact
Utilize marketing insights to inform and enhance demand forecasting models


Requirements


You have an understanding of Marketing Data and KPIs, or a strong appetite to learn this space.
Having experience in analyzing and interpreting marketing performance metrics would be a clear advantage.
You are a great communicator and storyteller - someone who enjoys helping non-technical audiences see what you see in the numbers!
You have hands-on experience working closely with senior stakeholders, ideally within Marketing, to deliver data-driven insights.
You are skilled in designing, executing, and interpreting A/B tests, as well as applying causal inference and impact modeling techniques.
You have econometric modeling experience; familiarity with marketing mix models (MMM) is a plus.
You are proficient in SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and transformation
You have Python expertise for data pre-processing, or statistical analysis. R would also be considered.
You are passionate about data literacy, continuously striving to improve your own skills and those of your team.


Our values


We win together: Food waste is a big beast to fight. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: We always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: Our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple.
We build a legacy: We’re proud of the change we’re driving.
We care: We always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.


What We Have To Offer


An opportunity to work in a global social-impact company and certified B Corporation! where you can see a real and tangible impact in your role.
To be an integral part of our Data & Analytics team. We are eager for you to make an impact and contribute to the role of analytics across key decisions and our solution processes. Your insights are valuable, and we are here to listen.
Work-life balance is important to us! Focus on the job to be done, not the hours spent, there is no need for overtime.
We trust in our employees and encourage an autonomous environment that provides several opportunities for employees to contribute, develop and take ownership of their work in a way that works for them.
To be part of an international company, with over 1,300+ colleagues across 19 countries that are on the same important mission.
An informal environment, working alongside 190+ passionate people within Tech & Product, mainly based in our HQ in Copenhagen.
We celebrate our differences and our successes and have a strong values-driven team culture.
We work in a hybrid set-up and value in office work weekly. Our London office is located in Shoreditch.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Job Description

We’re seeking a talented and motivated full-time Data Analyst to join our team. We’re looking for a key member of the team to own Data and Analytics to power the rest of the company and contribute to our data culture.

You will play a pivotal role in transforming data into actionable insights that drive key business decisions and product strategies. This is a cross-functional role, working closely with Sales, Revenue Operations, Support, Marketing, and other teams to translate data into meaningful narratives, and self-service tools that improve operational efficiency and drive growth.

You’ll help internal teams across the business make decisions using data and visualizations. The ability to think on one’s feet, enjoy collaborating with highly technical teams, and be comfortable working asynchronously is essential.

Key Responsibilities


Build and maintain dashboards to track key GTM metrics across sales, marketing, and revenue operations.
Analyze sales pipeline, conversion rates, and customer acquisition metrics to identify trends and opportunities.
Develop and automate reporting workflows to improve team efficiency.
Create and maintain documentation of data sources, metrics definitions, and analysis methodologies.
Collaborate with stakeholders to define KPIs and success metrics for GTM initiatives, including product-led growth metrics (user acquisition, activation, retention, etc.) by developing data strategies to provide these insights.
Provide regular insights and recommendations to the leadership team.


What We Are Looking For


Experience in a data analysis role, preferably in B2B SaaS and Growth.
Strong understanding of sales processes, revenue operations, and GTM motions.
Knowledge of SQL, and widely used tools like Salesforce, Snowflake, and dbt.
Proficiency in data visualization tools (Tableau, Looker, PowerBI).
Ability to give and process constructive feedback, as well as work independently.
Ability to communicate openly, supporting and championing innovation and inclusivity.
Flexibility to adjust to the dynamic nature of a startup, and adept at dealing with ambiguity.


As a company, we strive to maintain fair and equitable compensation practices within our team across all roles and all levels.

Individual offers may vary based on experience and skill set.

CAN Pay Ranges

$156,512—$195,640 CAD

Frequently cited statistics show that people who identify with historically marginalized groups are likely to apply to jobs only if they meet 100% of the qualifications. We encourage you to help us break that statistic!

What We Offer


An inclusive, flexible environment where you can be your authentic self. We recognize the impact of diverse voices and backgrounds on the growth of our people, product, and company. And that flexibility in how and when you work empowers our team to integrate work and life.
A competitive total compensation package. This includes a base salary, an equity incentive plan and variable commission (for quota-based roles).
Comprehensive group benefits with no waiting period. Take advantage of coverage for health, vision, dental, and more for you and your family!
All-remote with the opportunity to work from anywhere—enjoy a change of scenery wherever you can get wifi, participate in virtual and in-person social events, and leverage our corporate co-working program to visit WeWork (or other similar spaces near you).
Connect with other Tailscalars IRL. Attend our annual company retreat, participate in team/department off-sites, or use your individual travel budget to meet up with team members in Canada, the US, or the UK.
Support for your personal and professional development. Grow your career thoughtfully with $1500 USD annually for professional development, or take advantage of mentorship, coaching, and internal promotion opportunities.
Paid time off and a healthy work-life integration. Our flexible, paid time off program supports you for any situation life throws your way, whether moving homes or travelling the world! We encourage all Tailscalars to take 4-6 weeks of vacation annually.
A build-your-own home office setup. You choose your own company-owned laptop (Mac or PC), receive a monthly home internet reimbursement, and $1000 USD to customize your workstation to make it your own.

So why — despite the huge leaps we've taken in design and usability — does most business phone software still look, feel, and act like it was born in the 90s? OpenPhone is changing that.

We’re a new type of business phone with a mission to help people communicate better and be more productive.

We’re backed by Y Combinator and some of the best venture firms around including Tiger Global, Craft Ventures, Slow Ventures, and others. We take pride in providing an exceptional customer experience and a product people love, which is why we’re excited that our customers have rated us the #1 VoIP Provider on G2.

OpenPhone is the modern, sophisticated answer to the clunky, outdated phone systems that have been slowing down businesses for years. With thousands of happy customers and several rounds of funding in just five years, it's safe to say we're onto something big.

About The Role

We are hiring a Data Analyst with 4+ years of experience to primarily support our Go-To-Market (GTM) teams by providing insights and reporting to drive strategic decision-making. The ideal candidate will have strong analytical skills, experience with SQL, BI reporting tools, and a passion for translating data into actionable business insights.

Some Of The Things You’ll Do


Develop and maintain dashboards and reports using BI tools (e.g., Mode, Tableau) to support GTM teams.
Analyze marketing, advertising, and sales data, including conversion funnel and cohort retention analyses, slicing data by attribution models, and providing customer lifecycle insights.
Collaborate with stakeholders across sales, marketing, and customer success to define key metrics and reporting needs.
Write efficient SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data from various sources.
Assist in data modeling and transformation using dbt (a plus but not required).
Comfortable with working large and complex data coming from multiple sources such as Kafka events or web traffic data from ad platforms.
Communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Ensure data accuracy, integrity, and security in all reporting and analysis efforts.


About You


4+ years of experience in data analysis, preferably in a SaaS environment.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills with a quantitative mindset.
Familiarity with analytics engineering and dbt (a plus).
Excellent communication skills with the ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical audiences.
Ability to thrive in a high-paced, high-growth environment.
Experience managing data projects and collaborating with cross-functional teams.

And remember, there's no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. We're looking for optimists with grit and determination, who are excited to face the challenges of a growing startup. OpenPhone is the type of company where you can grow, and we encourage you to apply for this role even if you don't think you meet all the requirements.

We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment. It is important that you are able to bring your authentic self to work every day.

So why — despite the huge leaps we've taken in design and usability — does most business phone software still look, feel, and act like it was born in the 90s? OpenPhone is changing that.

We’re a new type of business phone with a mission to help people communicate better and be more productive.

We’re backed by Y Combinator and some of the best venture firms around including Tiger Global, Craft Ventures, Slow Ventures, and others. We take pride in providing an exceptional customer experience and a product people love, which is why we’re excited that our customers have rated us the #1 VoIP Provider on G2.

OpenPhone is the modern, sophisticated answer to the clunky, outdated phone systems that have been slowing down businesses for years. With thousands of happy customers and several rounds of funding in just five years, it's safe to say we're onto something big.

About The Role

We are hiring a Data Analyst with 4+ years of experience to primarily support our Go-To-Market (GTM) teams by providing insights and reporting to drive strategic decision-making. The ideal candidate will have strong analytical skills, experience with SQL, BI reporting tools, and a passion for translating data into actionable business insights. Experience in SaaS environments and familiarity with key SaaS metrics is highly desirable.

Some Of The Things You’ll Do


Develop and maintain dashboards and reports using BI tools (e.g., Mode, Tableau) to support GTM teams.
Analyze marketing, advertising, and sales data, including conversion funnel and cohort retention analyses, slicing data by attribution models, and providing customer lifecycle insights.
Collaborate with stakeholders across sales, marketing, and customer success to define key metrics and reporting needs.
Write efficient SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data from various sources.
Assist in data modeling and transformation using dbt (a plus but not required).
Comfortable with working large and complex data coming from multiple sources such as Kafka events or web traffic data from ad platforms.
Communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Ensure data accuracy, integrity, and security in all reporting and analysis efforts.


About You


4+ years of experience in data analysis, preferably in a SaaS environment.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills with a quantitative mindset.
Familiarity with analytics engineering and dbt (a plus).
Excellent communication skills with the ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical audiences.
Ability to thrive in a high-paced, high-growth environment.
Experience managing data projects and collaborating with cross-functional teams.

SF Bay Area, Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Boston, New York, and Washington, DC Metro: $158,000 - $176,000 USD

Canada: 160,000 - $178,000 CAD


The ranges displayed reflect the target for new hire salaries, and within each range, individual pay is determined by your skills and experience, as well as relevant education. Your recruiter can share more and answer questions about the specific salary range during the hiring process.

Salary is just one component of OpenPhone’s total compensation package. Your total rewards package will include equity, extensive medical coverage, a monthly lifestyle stipend, and a flexible PTO policy.

Who We Are

As a fully remote company, we thrive asynchronously as a team. We are curious, ambitious, and dedicated to our work. We value trust above all else, and have a strong bias for action. If you're looking for a place to do your life's work, please get in touch. We'd love to hear from you.

And remember, there's no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. We're looking for optimists with grit and determination, who are excited to face the challenges of a growing startup. OpenPhone is the type of company where you can grow, and we encourage you to apply for this role even if you don't think you meet all the requirements.

We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment. It is important that you are able to bring your authentic self to work every day.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists, and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you’ll do

About The Internship Experience

Our internship program provides the opportunity to work on meaningful business initiatives that will grow the GDP of the internet. Through the internship, you will work with many systems and technologies, gain experience in working with large datasets and analytical methodologies/tools to help us better understand our users and build better products.

Each intern has a dedicated mentor, and every intern project is part of the team's roadmap that will directly contribute to Stripe's mission. As you collaborate with industry experts on initiatives that expand global commerce, you will develop a strong first-hand understanding of the role analytics plays in steering business strategy and results.

We're not just focused on your immediate contributions; we're invested in your growth. Stripe sees this internship as an opportunity to grow your technical expertise and facilitate personal development, preparing you for a career in the tech industry.

Responsibilities

You will:


Partner closely with Data Scientists, Data Analysts, and business partners to drive business impact through rigorous analytical solutions
Apply machine learning, causal inference, or advanced analytics on large datasets to: i) measure results and outcomes, ii) identify causal impact and attribution, iii) predict the future performance of users or products, to drive business success
Influence business actions and strategy by developing actionable insights through metrics and dashboards.
Drive the collection of new data and the refinement of existing data sources.
Learn quickly by asking great questions, finding how to work with your mentor and teammates effectively, and communicating the status of your work clearly

Who you are

Minimum Requirements

Enrolled in a quantitative Master's program (e.g. Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, Statistics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2025 or spring/summer 2026
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Experience communicating and collaborating with multidisciplinary stakeholders in a team environment



Preferred Qualifications

You also likely have:

Hybrid work at Stripe

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $135,200 - $135,200. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

To do this, we start with our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization.

Data is at the heart of Lyft’s products and decision-making. You will leverage data and rigorous, analytical thinking to shape our products and make business decisions. This will involve performing rigorous product deep dives, identifying opportunities for product enhancements, and measuring the impact of new features.

The Verticals team encompasses 3 critical and unique products / marketplaces within Lyft: airports, scheduled rides, and events. Airports are one of the most important, impactful, and complex parts of Lyft’s Rideshare business, as they are a key part of both the rider and driver Lyft experience and have unique dynamics. Scheduled rides allow riders to book a ride in advance with high reliability, and enable drivers to add structure to their work schedule. Lastly, events such as concerts or sporting games require similar considerations of special operations to ensure a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.

As a Senior Data Analyst on the Verticals team, you will collaborate with engineering, product, design, operations, and marketing to think critically about the current rider and driver experience and implement product enhancements to facilitate market growth. The ideal candidate can apply strong business acumen to propose product and marketplace changes, and is comfortable working with a highly cross functional team. In this role, you will help us tackle problems such as:


Which airports are underperforming and which key metrics can we use to identify and classify airport performance? What targets should we set for these key metrics?
What is driving high cancellation rates today and which types of riders/drivers are cancelling? What product changes can we implement to reduce cancellation rates for scheduled rides?
How are riders and drivers using different ride modes at airports and events, and how do we design products to address this behavior?
How are riders and drivers discovering scheduled rides and are there entry point optimizations we can implement?


Responsibilities:


Leverage data and analytic frameworks to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency across Verticals products, recommending solutions to drive business impact
Understand the complex business dynamics across the Verticals product areas, specifically how these products differ from traditional rideshare marketplaces, to propose enhancements that compliment Lyft-wide products
Partner with product managers, engineers, marketers, designers, and operators to translate data insights into decisions and action
Develop dashboards and analytical frameworks to monitor business and product performance
Establish metrics that measure the health of our products, the business, as well as the rider and driver experiences


Experience:


5-7+ years of experience in data analytics in a high-growth environment
Degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, economics, applied math, operations research or engineering (an asset, advanced degrees also an asset)
End-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, analysis, and visualization
Ability to manage, influence, negotiate, and inspire others in a fast-moving environment
Proficient in SQL and quantitative analysis, you can deep dive into large amounts of data, draw meaningful insights, dissect business issues and draw actionable conclusions
Outcome-driven approach to developing recommendations and demonstrated ability to develop a story and execution plan to support goals and objectives
Exceptional communication (listening, written, and oral) skills with the ability to present findings and recommendations targeted to the audience in question.
A drive to understand the core issues along with the determination to uncover the solution
Thrives within ambiguity and context-switching

Our Business Intelligence Specialist will enable a data-driven strategy at Resolver by building dashboards and providing insights on key results. This is a role where you will work with stakeholders across the business to define how data impacts our business. The future state is a data-centric culture where leaders are empowered with self-service data for decision-making. You will drive conversations across the company on the insights in our data and how we can use them to improve results.

About Resolver:

Resolver is a high-growth SaaS company whose intuitive, no-code platform gives our customers a clear picture of their risks so they can make quick and effective decisions. As a part of the Resolver team, your work will help transform risk management to risk intelligence so organizations can protect people and assets and deliver on their purpose.

We are ambitious in both our mission and our culture. As a business within Kroll, we offer an innovative, non-hierarchical work environment blended with the stability and financial security of an enterprise. Resolver has also been named one of Canada’s Great Places to Work six years in a row!

What you'll be doing:

Data Analysis (60%)


Serve as a centralized reporting agent for all divisions at Resolver, adjusting monthly reports with updated data sources and resolving issues with current reporting as required
Provide new reporting, dashboards and other visualization to the business that will support growth
Proactively identify trends and business insights that improve results against core corporate KPIs: ARR, win-rate, back-to-base revenue
Collaborate with key stakeholders on division-level reports across services, product, sales, marketing and division leads
Ability to break down complex business challenges, identify root causes and develop data-driven solutions is crucial



Data Management(30%)


Detect data quality issues and their root causes; implement fixes and design data audits to capture the issues in the future
Monitor dashboards to ensure they’re functioning properly. Troubleshoot when issues arise
Maintain standards for key metrics to avoid inconsistency in reporting across dashboards and teams
Make use of historical metrics when setting up reporting, with aim of enabling teams to deliver and exceed on division-level and corporate-level objectives
Write and maintain documentation to support our goal of being a data-centric culture; support data integrity. Document untapped data sources that teams could leverage in future reporting



Strategy (10%)


Regularly report to stakeholders on the business impact of the BI infrastructure and BI-related projects
Understand stakeholder requirements and anticipate future needs as it relates to data and data management
Continuously advance our data culture by researching the market and recommending industry best-practices



What you bring to the table:


3-5 years work experience working with BI tools (e.g. Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Domo).
Expert at building intuitive, well-thought-out dashboards that users love. A keen eye for data visualization and finding elegant solutions for making complex data understandable
2+ years data modelling, analysis, cleaning and QA
Experience with SQL
Post Secondary degree is required



Nice to haves:


Background in analytics, mathematics or another quantitative field would be amazing
Experience with Python or R is a plus. Experience with predictive data analytics and data viz libraries would be a big asset (e.g. Scikit-learn, SciPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Plotly)
Experience with Snowflake would be a major asset, as would experience with CRM data



What we’ll give you in return:

Resolver is one of Canada's Great Workplaces. Culture isn't just something we write about (although we do), we live our values and challenge each other to be our best selves. We invest in Resolverites who will grow with us. We have a comprehensive rewards package to show our team our appreciation for everything they do:

We know how important it is to have a good boss, so we invest in their development.

Chainlink Labs is the primary contributing developer of Chainlink, the decentralized computing platform powering the verifiable web. Chainlink is the industry-standard platform for providing access to real-world data, offchain computation, and secure cross-chain interoperability across any blockchain. Chainlink Labs helps power verifiable applications for banking, DeFi, global trade, and gaming by collaborating with some of the world’s largest financial institutions, notably Swift, DTCC, and ANZ. Chainlink Labs also works with top Web3 teams, including Aave, Compound, GMX, Maker, and Synthetix. Chainlink Labs was ranked in Newsweek’s 100 Most Loved Workplaces 2023 in both the United States and United Kingdom.

Chainlink Labs is pioneering the world’s first fully sustainable and decentralized oracle network, and the Economics team is searching for a Senior Analyst to play a critical role in building it. This role will sit at the intersection of blockchain technology, financial innovation, and economic systems, and shape the future of decentralized economics.

As a Senior Analyst, you will combine economics, data science, and blockchain expertise to shape incentives, optimize network design, and influence the decision-making of our Economics and Executive Leadership teams. You will design, analyze, and operationalize economic models for production applications. You will collaborate across departments to bring innovative solutions from concept to production, ensuring economic soundness and scalability throughout.

This is a high-impact role, offering visibility and influence as you contribute to the development of the Chainlink network. If you’re a meticulous, creative, and motivated individual ready to solve complex economic problems through data-driven decisions in the rapidly evolving world of Web3, this is the role for you.

Your Impact


You'll serve two primary functions: (1) designing and performing analyses that help the Economics and Executive Leadership teams make informed, data-driven decisions, and (2) building and maintaining systems for the parameterization of production applications.
You'll work on a wide array of blockchain economics projects, analyses, and systems, including:
Designing novel mechanisms and incentive schemes
Building models and simulations to evaluate investment opportunities
Designing and parameterizing trading systems
Optimizing parameters for production applications
Contributing to the design of Economics programs and applications
You'll optimize network incentives and systems by engaging directly with the Economics, Product, Engineering, Research, and Data Science teams to understand network dynamics at the deepest level.
You'll operationalize processes and analytics systems, and coordinate cross-functionally to implement them.
This is both a highly technical and highly social role. You will have high visibility and a large impact on how Chainlink builds the world’s first fully sustainable decentralized oracle network.

Requirements


5+ years experience in a quantitative role, particularly trading or quant research
A deep understanding of financial and crypto markets and incentives
Extensive financial modeling background, including data engineering and model automation
Strong SQL and Python skills are mandatory
Experience solving economic problems through statistical/econometric analyses
Substantial data analysis and/or data science experience
Meticulous attention to detail.


Preferred Qualifications


Strong Economics and/or Finance background through Masters-level academics and/or multiple years of industry experience.
Strong organizational and coordination skills necessary to productionize/operationalize processes and applications.
Preferably smart contract programming experience (Rust, Go, Solidity), but familiarity with smart contract code and dApp architecture at a minimum
Published research with an economics or crypto focus (e.g., papers on MEV or PBS, staking and slashing dynamics, node compensation, tokenomics, etc.)


All roles with Chainlink Labs are global and remote-based. Unless otherwise stated, we ask that you try to overlap some working hours with Eastern Standard Time (EST).
