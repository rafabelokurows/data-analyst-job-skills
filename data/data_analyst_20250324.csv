Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It’s where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you’ll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You’ll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Creating a life you love also means finding a career that celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences that you bring. As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

The Sales Strategy & Operations (SS&O) team partners with advertising sales leaders across sales strategy and analytics, operations and process and tools. Team members are experts in business strategy and operations and analytical and strategic thinking. They are pragmatic and results-oriented. As a Business Intelligence Analyst, you will focus on empowering sales leadership and the broader sales organization with self-serve access to data and insights. You’ll be responsible for designing, building and maintaining scaled sales analytics solutions (dashboards, data tables) for over one thousand internal users.

What You’ll Do


Collaborate with SS&O team members and sales leaders to define key business metrics and gather requirements for which insights should be made available at scale. Architect data pipelines, design and build new Tableau dashboards for stakeholders to use to address their needs. Maintain and improve existing sales data infrastructure and Tableau dashboards based on evolving business requirements.
Democratize sales data by enabling self-serve access to key business drivers, trends and operating metrics. Design fully automated dashboards that are easy to understand, enable self-serve access for the sales org, and can be used by a broad audience with a variety of use cases.
Publish and maintain clear documentation to inform and educate users at scale, gather feedback to identify opportunities for improvement.
Identify ways to streamline and improve the efficiency of our data. Implement changes to our infrastructure (optimize SQL queries and data workflows) to improve the landing time of our data.
Work with cross-functional teams including Sales, Strategic Finance, and Business Intelligence to identify data needs and gaps, and align on solutions.
Lead projects end to end, see around corners and provide thought partnership to your team.



What We’re Looking For


3+ years of professional experience in highly analytical environments such as management consulting, investment banking, corporate strategy or technology/media companies.
Understanding of sales and digital advertising platforms and working knowledge of sales systems and tools (Salesforce).
Strong data analytics and business intelligence skills - querying large data sets with advanced SQL, building visualizations with Tableau. Experience building and maintaining data pipelines (authoring, scheduling, monitoring workflows).
Ability to visualize complex data sets that provide insights and clearly inform areas of action.
Passion for building new solutions and enabling analysis at scale to drive decision-making.
Experience in a complex, fast-paced environment.
Organized, detail-oriented and strategically focused.
Strong written and verbal communication skills.
Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as business administration, or equivalent experience.



Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement


We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.
This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 1-2 times/month and therefore needs to be in a commutable distance from the NY office.



At Pinterest we believe the workplace should be equitable, inclusive, and inspiring for every employee. In an effort to provide greater transparency, we are sharing the base salary range for this position. The position is also eligible for equity. Final salary is based on a number of factors including location, travel, relevant prior experience, or particular skills and expertise.

Job Summary

The Research Data Analyst functions as a statistical analyst for the UCSF Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy, and Sleep Medicine supporting divisional principal investigators. The Research Data Analyst will primarily be responsible for developing and conducting complex statistical analyses and providing database development and management.

The Research Data Analyst is specifically tailored to work on exposure-related lung diseases. The lung is constantly exposed to various environmental pollutants, allergens, and toxins, which interact with airways and alveoli and result in inflammation, injury, and disease. The specific laboratory that houses this position is focused on the paradigm that respiratory exposures to pollutants and toxicants contribute to development and progression of chronic lung diseases, and may further yield systemic effects well beyond lungs. Under this paradigm, the research activities have focused on understanding the physiologic and immunologic mechanisms via which environmental exposures contribute to chronic lung diseases and how knowledge of these mechanisms could be translated to ways to better define, prognosticate, and manage disease burden at both individual and societal levels.

The Research Data Analyst will use skills as an experienced research professional with an in-depth understanding of biostatistics and research software programming techniques to oversee and conduct the statistical component of new and ongoing protocols. The analyst will work closely with research team members (e.g., principal investigators, research managers, trainees, CRCs, etc.) to support the conduct of the research. The individual will help manage, analyze, interpret, and report on statistical findings. Specifically, the individual will conduct complex statistical analyses and prepare findings for presentation at professional meeting and publication in medical journals.


NOTE: This is a part-time (50%) Contract role for 1 year.


The final salary and offer components are subject to additional approvals based on UC policy.

Your placement within the salary range is dependent on a number of factors including your work experience and internal equity within this position classification at UCSF. For positions that are represented by a labor union, placement within the salary range will be guided by the rules in the collective bargaining agreement.

The salary range for this position is $87,900 - $126,900 (Annual Rate).

Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities. In fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.

Our vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we're creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality. Homeward supports Medicare-eligible beneficiaries by partnering with health plans, providers, and communities to align incentives – taking full financial accountability for clinical outcomes and the total cost of care across rural counties.

As a public benefit corporation and Certified B Corp™, Homeward's mission and business model are aligned to address the healthcare, economic, and demographic challenges that make it challenging for rural Americans to stay healthy. Our Homeward Navigation™ platform uses advanced analytics to connect members to the right care and local resources that address social determinants of health and improve holistic health outcomes. Since many rural communities lack adequate clinical capacity, Homeward also employs care teams that supplement local practices and reach people who cannot otherwise access care.

Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo's products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding. With this leadership team and funding, Homeward is committed to bringing high-quality healthcare to rural communities in need.

Built by engineers for engineers, The Teleport Access Platform delivers on-demand, least privileged access to infrastructure based on cryptographic identity and zero trust, with built-in identity security and policy governance, making the happy path for engineers the secure path.

Teleport is trusted by the world’s fastest-moving companies, including Elastic, Snowflake, Doordash, and NASDAQ. We recently raised US$110M at a US$1.1B valuation.

Our Vision

Today's computing environments have too much complexity, too many network boundaries, and too little trust. Complexity slows engineers down and leads to human errors. Complex systems can’t be secure despite the red tape of bureaucracy. We make trusted computing simple. This gives engineers the freedom to move and build a better future.

Why Teleport

At Teleport, we focus on empowering our people to accomplish their goals by working alongside highly talented people to make the most of their careers. You have the freedom, autonomy and trust to do what you’re great at and have a significant impact on the future prospects of the company. 

Whether that’s taking a feature or project from ideation to deployment or working with some of the biggest, most interesting companies in the world and solving real challenges for them, we want you to help us build the future.

We’re not a big company. You won’t get lost in a crowd. Instead, we move fast, with a team that wants to make an impact, that shares in our success, and gives you the freedom, power, and autonomy to become the very best at what you do.

The Benefits

While many companies flaunt their benefits and perks to convince you to join their company, we believe your career is more important than that. That’s why we focus on making your day-to-day the best it can be while empowering you to achieve your goals and aspirations. 

What does that mean?

- It means you’ll have the autonomy to make your own decisions and focus on what’s important to you and your role.

- It means having access to a senior team that supports you and wants to see you succeed.

- You’ll have a smart team you can learn from, collaborate with, and grow with.

- It means being able to make an impact and have a voice in the future of the feature, product or company direction. We don’t just leave you to focus on a niche. We allow you to spread your wings and take advantage of opportunities, challenging projects and exciting problems.

- It means removing the bureaucracy and red tape that stifles innovation while giving you access to all the information you need to build and take action more quickly. 

- It means allowing you to have the career you’ve always wanted today, rather than having to “earn your stripes” and wait for the right moment. If you’re good enough, you’re good enough.

But we don’t stop there.

In addition to the career opportunities at Teleport, we offer a whole range of benefits that help you to maximize your future, including:

- Extensive health coverage

- Annual expense budget

- Rest & recovery policies that maximize leave and your ability to recharge

Do you have what it takes?

Get to use (and know) Teleport through our unique interview process 

At Teleport, we do things a bit differently. And when we say we only hire top talent, we actually mean it. Because of this, our interview process is different too - and we’re proud of it.  We let your work do the talking. We don’t go in for six rounds of interviews, live whiteboard or live-coding. We don’t hire people that can talk a good game. We only want the best. And for that, we need to see what you can do,  in your own time, in your own way.  For real.

But interviews are a two-way street. Through the project, you’ll get a real taste of life at Teleport, including: 

- We’re flexible - you’ll have plenty of time to complete your project, if life gets in the way, that’s ok. We can - work around you. 

- We give you autonomy  - you’ll have the space and freedom to figure things out, make decisions, and problem-solve.

- We’re collaborative -  Got questions?

- We have answers. You’ll have support from your team - the one you’ll be working with day in day out if you’re successful in getting the role.

- We progress careers - During the project,  see how much you learn. That’s what working at Teleport is like. We like learning, on the job. All-the-time. 

- We can move fast (if you can) - two weeks sound like a long time? No problem? Early submissions are fine, and we’ll keep the process moving. 

Think you’ve got what it takes? We’d love to see it! Unconvinced? We can guarantee three things: 

- It’ll challenge you.

- You'll learn a lot. 

- If you love the process, you'll love working at Teleport.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

As the founding member of our Finance Data Science and Analytics team, you will play an instrumental role in our company’s mission of building safe and beneficial artificial intelligence by building and scaling a data driven culture from the ground up. In this unique company, technology, and moment in history, your work will be critical to informing our product and commercial strategy as we deploy safe, frontier AI at scale to the world.

As the first data scientist embedded in our Finance team, you will use advanced analytics to drive strategic decision-making and business intelligence. You'll work at the intersection of finance, data science, and business to develop models that provide insights into our consumption-based and subscription-based business model, help optimize cloud spend, and support financial forecasting. You've worked in cultures of excellence in the past and are eager to apply that experience to building robust and scalable systems and processes as our company goes through a phase of rapid growth.

Responsibilities


Establish the foundation for financial data science at Anthropic, creating processes and best practices
Develop predictive models and analytics systems to support financial planning, forecasting, and scenario analysis
Partner with Strategic Finance teams to optimize customer health, cloud spend and model unit economics
Create and maintain dashboards and reporting systems that provide actionable insights to leadership
Use machine learning and statistical techniques to identify trends, anomalies, and opportunities in financial and operational data
Develop scalable data pipelines and infrastructure to support financial analytics
Translate complex analytical findings into clear recommendations for business stakeholders
Champion data-driven decision making across the organization


You May Be a Good Fit If You Have


6+ years of experience in data science or analytics roles
3+ years of experience deeply embedding in Finance teams with a proven track record of using data science to drive business decisions and financial outcomes
A passion for the company's mission of building helpful, honest, and harmless AI
Expertise in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools.
Experience with cloud computing platforms (AWS, GCP) and their cost structures
A bias for action and urgency, not letting perfect be the enemy of the effective
A strong disposition to thrive in ambiguity, taking initiative to create clarity and forward progress
A deep curiosity and energy for pulling the thread on hard questions
Experience in turning open questions and data into concise and insightful analysis
Proven ability to build strong cross-functional partnerships


Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$265,000 - $315,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

The Role

Square is looking for a Data Analyst to join the Seller Customer Success Operations team to help build the strategy by providing data insights around customer satisfaction, team happiness, and operational efficiency.

As a member of the team, you will lead experimentation initiatives, develop automation solutions, run analysis and summarize insights from the vast amount of data captured by Square, and guide strategic decisions based on data to improve the performance of our organization.

You Will


Partner with stakeholders throughout the organization to facilitate data-informed decision-making by leveraging analytics
Utilize a variety of strategies, including statistical analysis and quantitative reasoning, to address challenges, conduct research, and generate actionable insights
Independently manage, coordinate, and resolve intricate problems through data-driven analysis
Communicate analysis and decisions to high-level partners and executives in verbal, visual, and written media
Provide comprehensive daily analytics support to partner teams, develop resources to empower data access and self-service so your expertise can be used where it is most impactful
Contribute in strategic analytical projects that provide relevant insights or promote operational change


You Have


5 years of analytical experience in consulting, data analytics, data science, or machine learning and predictive analytics
Bachelor's degree, with a major in analytics, statistics, finance, or data science field, or equivalent practical experience.
Advanced to expert level SQL proficiency
Experience with reporting and visualization platforms (e.g. Tableau, Looker)
Work experience with Python
Familiarity with statistics techniques to structure analyses and provide insights (e.g. statistical tests, AB testing)
Experience in applying data-backed heuristics to solve practical product problems such as predicting churn, cross selling, clustering user archetypes, and more is a plus

          Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.<br><br>So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.<br><br>Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.<br><br><strong>The Role<br><br></strong>Square is looking for a Data Analyst to join the Seller Customer Success Operations team to help build the strategy by providing data insights around customer satisfaction, team happiness, and operational efficiency.<br><br>As a member of the team, you will lead experimentation initiatives, develop automation solutions, run analysis and summarize insights from the vast amount of data captured by Square, and guide strategic decisions based on data to improve the performance of our organization.<br><br><strong>You Will<br><br></strong><ul><li>Partner with stakeholders throughout the organization to facilitate data-informed decision-making by leveraging analytics</li><li>Utilize a variety of strategies, including statistical analysis and quantitative reasoning, to address challenges, conduct research, and generate actionable insights</li><li>Independently manage, coordinate, and resolve intricate problems through data-driven analysis</li><li>Communicate analysis and decisions to high-level partners and executives in verbal, visual, and written media</li><li>Provide comprehensive daily analytics support to partner teams, develop resources to empower data access and self-service so your expertise can be used where it is most impactful</li><li>Contribute in strategic analytical projects that provide relevant insights or promote operational change<br><br></li></ul><strong>You Have<br><br></strong><ul><li>5 years of analytical experience in consulting, data analytics, data science, or machine learning and predictive analytics</li><li>Bachelor's degree, with a major in analytics, statistics, finance, or data science field, or equivalent practical experience.</li><li>Advanced to expert level SQL proficiency </li><li>Experience with reporting and visualization platforms (e.g. Tableau, Looker)</li><li>Work experience with Python</li><li>Familiarity with statistics techniques to structure analyses and provide insights (e.g. statistical tests, AB testing)</li><li>Experience in applying data-backed heuristics to solve practical product problems such as predicting churn, cross selling, clustering user archetypes, and more is a plus<br><br></li></ul>Block takes a market-based approach to pay, and pay may vary depending on your location.

Processing data is our core business. We use data to develop, train, and implement models while creating a deeper understanding of business processes for our clients. We believe that data should never be processed in isolation or without the proper context. That’s why we provide contextual analytics—taking into account what the data represents, rather than just analyzing numbers or text stored in a file or database.

And yes, we also develop and train AI/ML models, but only if they add value to what our clients expect from us.

Role

As a Junior Analyst, you will work closely with senior analysts and managers to collect, process, and define data for various projects. This involves conducting detailed data analyses to determine data quality, performing fit-for-purpose assessments, and designing and implementing data pipelines.

To ensure high-quality and meaningful results, you will continuously validate outputs and underlying assumptions. This is achieved by reviewing relevant documentation and discussing findings with internal or client subject matter experts.

Key Responsibilities:

Extract, process, and classify data from structured sources
Develop models to extract data from unstructured sources
Build models to forecast (financial) metrics
Create key metrics to identify patterns and insights
Develop dashboards for (senior) management
Define implementation strategies for productionizing analyses

What We Offer

We value individual contributions and encourage professional growth. We enjoy working together and learning from each other. Our clients benefit from our expertise, and our colleagues develop as professionals.

Our assignments are challenging and diverse, meaning no two days, projects, or clients are the same.

Benefits:

Competitive salary with a bonus scheme
Hybrid & flexible working options, plus 30 vacation days
A young, dynamic, and diverse team with passion and ambition
Two additional leave days per year for volunteering
Choice of a company car or public transport card
Laptop, phone, and internet allowance (also for personal use)

Your Profile

We are looking for ambitious individuals with a strong understanding of mathematics and its applications. You should have an intrinsic drive to learn and understand business processes, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret data in a meaningful way.

Education:

Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Economics, or Quantitative Finance

Required Skills:

Basic programming knowledge (Python, R, SQL)
Ability to design and implement mathematical models
Strong foundation in statistical analysis

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own.
