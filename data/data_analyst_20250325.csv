About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of more than 240 employees from over 40 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

Getreu unserem Motto – People is what makes us us – sind uns deine nachhaltige Ausbildung und Weiterentwicklung, deine ausgeglichene Work-Life-Balance und deine Happiness sehr wichtig. Konkret stellen wir mit 32 Urlaubstagen, 60 % mobilem Arbeiten, bis zu 4 Wochen pro Jahr – im europäischen Ausland – der Möglichkeit remote zu arbeiten, Sabbatical und Überstundenausgleich sicher, dass dir im FUSE-Agentur-Leben nichts fehlt.

In unserem derzeit über 60-köpfigen Team sowie unseren Kund*innen haben wir unser perfektes Match bereits gefunden. Wenn du noch auf der Suche bist, bei „popkulturellem Relevanzmarketing“ neugierig wirst und für Social Media, Influencer Marketing oder Gaming & Esports brennst, dann lass uns zusammen loslegen! Denn : Action Creates Impact .

Dein Job

Als (Junior) Insights Analyst (mensch) bearbeitest du als Teil unseres Data und Analytics Teams in erster Linie die Anfragen unserer Kunden nach Social Media Reportings sowie Social Listening Analysen und beherrschst den Spagat zwischen analytischem und kreativem Denken, um die Kolleg:Innen in deinem und anderen Teams mit datenbasierten Insights zu Kundenmeinungen, Märkten, Zielgruppen, Marken und ihren Social Media-Umfeldern zu versorgen.

Dein Aufgabenbereich

Datenbeschaffung / Toolbedienung

Du bist präzise, schnell, zuverlässig und motiviert, wenn es um die manuelle Erfassung großer (Social Media)- Datenmengen geht, aber auch wissbegierig und begeisterungsfähig, dich diesbezüglich kontinuierlich mit Prozessoptimierung zu befassen, sowie dich in Tools und automatisierte Datenerfassungsprozesse und Methoden einzudenken, um immer bessere Lösungen zu finden.

Datenstrukturierung, Effiziente Datensammlung, Query Writing, Kategorisierung und Datendarstellung werden hier deine täglichen Begleiter.

Studiendurchführung

Von der (manchmal noch recht schwammigen) Fragestellung bis zum fertigen Analysebericht mit guten Insights und Handlungsempfehlungen ist es oft ein weiter aber spannender Weg. Der kann bald auch deiner sein, gemeinsam mit uns im Team.

Du hast ein sehr gutes Gespür für Sprache und Kommunikation? Nice, das brauchst du hier in mindestens dreierlei Hinsicht: Erstens, um aus den Aussagen und Briefings unserer Auftraggeber herausfiltern zu können, wie du ihnen am besten weiterhelfen kannst. Zweitens, wenn es darum geht, die Essenz von Konsumenten-Posts und Kommentaren auf Social Media zu verstehen, schließlich ist Inhaltanalyse unser Daily-Business. Und Drittens, um dann Deine Findings Zielgruppengerecht rüberzubringen - in Reports, in Meetings und bei Präsentationen.

Datenanalyse

Auswertungslogiken passend zu den gegebenen Fragestellungen und Erkenntnisinteressen erstellen, Dimensionierungen & Kategorisierungen für Inhaltsanalysen planen und entwickeln, Daten auszählen, filtern, darstellen, vergleichen, interpretieren, daraus kreative Idee und Empfehlungen ableiten. Das ist dein Playground. Deine Affinität zu Zahlen und Daten kannst du hier immer wieder beweisen. Ein stets strukturiertes Vorgehen und ein souveräner Umgang auch mit großen und komplexen Datenmengen, Statistiken und Zahlen sind für dich selbstverständlich.

Spezielle Social Media Analyse-Tools wirst Du ebenso (kennenlernen und) zum Einsatz bringen wie ganz viel Excel und das gute alte Powerpoint.

Das bringst du mit

Du kannst (erste) Erfahrung in der qualitativen und quantitativen Forschungsarbeit, sowie in der marketing- oder kundenorientierten Projektarbeit vorweisen und hast Lust dich im Bereich Social Media Analytics weiter auszutoben. Du hast, dank deines Studiums, einen kommunikations-, sozial- oder medienwissenschaftlichen Background und bringst Kenntnisse der Methoden im Bereich der quantitativen und qualitativen Marktforschung mit. Du hast neben den analytischen Fähigkeiten, auch ein Gespür für gute kreative Kommunikation und Lust, diese mitzuentwickeln. Du bist organisiert und selbständig, willst aber auch noch ständig ganz viel lernen und verstehst dich als Teamplayer, der immer auf Höhe des Zeitgeists ist und daraus neue Impulse für unsere Teams und Kunden ableitet. Außerdem hast Du sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse in Wort und Schrift, sehr gute MS Office Kenntnisse, insbesondere Excel und PowerPoint und bist im besten Fall mit Analytics Tools im Bereich Social Listening & Web Analytics vertraut.

Darum wir

Als Teil der FUSE erfährst du stets Rückenwind von deinem Team, arbeitest für Kunden - die unsere Werte „BOLD. TRUE. EASY. TOGETHER.“ leben und kannst aktiv Prozesse und Strukturen mitentwickeln. Denn ganz getreu unserem Wert TOGETHER setzen wir auf das Potential im Team. Neben unvergesslichen Events bieten wir dir viel Raum für persönliche und berufliche Weiterentwicklung.

Information about the position

As a Decision Scientist at Vinted, your work will have a tangible impact on the real world, empowering Vinted’s members to lead more sustainable lives. You will play a key role in shaping our product and business strategy by leveraging data to drive impactful decision-making.

This role is ideal for someone who thrives in a fast-paced environment, enjoys problem-solving, and is passionate about using data to drive meaningful change.

Our Decision Scientists work within the broader Data Science & Analytics (DSA) organisation, where we have three distinct roles.

Decision Scientists are responsible for actionable insights, identifying and sizing opportunities, and developing automated tools that increase the quality of product and business decisions by applying statistical methods and data-driven decision-making.

Data Scientists are responsible for identification of algorithmic opportunities, ensuring those opportunities are addressed in an optimal fashion and design, development and maintenance of production-grade statistical and machine learning algorithms.

Analytics Engineers are responsible for data curation – translating data needs from stakeholders into architecting, building and maintaining efficient & reliable data models and pipelines.

As a Decision Scientist at Vinted, you’ll:


Partner with your team and stakeholders at Vinted, to identify strategic opportunities and provide data-driven recommendations, as well as answer critical business questions.
Test and analyse developed opportunities to validate their value and understand their business impact, using statistical methods and visualisation tools
Select, calculate, and monitor your team's key performance indicators, proactively flagging issues, running analyses and understanding root causes
Enable your team and direct stakeholders to independently leverage data for business insights via self-service dashboards
Contribute to a data-driven culture by promoting best practices in analytics and decision-making to make data count.


About You


Experience in a Decision Science or Data Analytics role.

We focus every day on building the foundation for tomorrow and creating a workplace that embraces differences, values flexibility, and is aligned to our purpose-driven and future-focused work. We offer a highly collaborative, caring team environment with a strong focus on learning and development, recognition for your individual contributions, and a variety of benefit options for you to choose from.

What you`ll do:

Summary

Working in this role, you’ll drive and contribute to efficiency, transparency and data intelligence projects with a focus on the automation of information flows and demand-oriented information provisioning. Your work will directly support the SAP BTP leadership team in their decision-making processes, enable data driven decision making and increase the availability and accuracy of business insights.

The Role

The role comes with three main activities – exploring data, conducting data analysis and proactively acting on the potential outcomes; more specifically, it will fall under your responsibilities to ...


seek for adequate data sources throughout the company,
provide insights via SAP Analytics Cloud dashboards, identify potential issues and investigate the respective context and reasoning, and
take on projects in order to provide solutions, together with the responsible teams and colleagues.


Working with specialized business solutions such as SAP Analytics Cloud, SAP Datasphere and SAP HANA databases, the role requires first knowledge and experience with the mentioned or comparable solutions as well as basic programming skills in pro-code and low-code environments.

Working in a dynamic environment and in an agile setup, strong collaboration and self-organization skills as well as the ability to work on complex scenarios will be considered as highly beneficial. It's crucial to highlight a key requirement for this position: relocation to our Potsdam or Berlin office since our team primarily operates from Potsdam/Berlin three days a week.

Meet Your Team

Our team supports the Member of the SAP Extended Board – General Manager & Chief Product Officer, SAP BTP. We focus on the identification and contribution to strategic projects/initiatives with an elevated impact/importance for the SAP BTP Unit and the success of our underlaying platform, the BTP.

Getreu unserem Motto – People is what makes us us – sind uns deine nachhaltige Ausbildung und Weiterentwicklung, deine ausgeglichene Work-Life-Balance und deine Happiness sehr wichtig. Konkret stellen wir mit 32 Urlaubstagen, 60 % mobilem Arbeiten, bis zu 4 Wochen pro Jahr – im europäischen Ausland – der Möglichkeit remote zu arbeiten, Sabbatical und Überstundenausgleich sicher, dass dir im FUSE-Agentur-Leben nichts fehlt.

In unserem derzeit über 60-köpfigen Team sowie unseren Kund*innen haben wir unser perfektes Match bereits gefunden. Wenn du noch auf der Suche bist, bei „popkulturellem Relevanzmarketing“ neugierig wirst und für Social Media, Influencer Marketing oder Gaming & Esports brennst, dann lass uns zusammen loslegen! Denn : Action Creates Impact .

Dein Job

Als (Junior) Insights Analyst (mensch) bearbeitest du als Teil unseres Data und Analytics Teams in erster Linie die Anfragen unserer Kunden nach Social Media Reportings sowie Social Listening Analysen und beherrschst den Spagat zwischen analytischem und kreativem Denken, um die Kolleg:Innen in deinem und anderen Teams mit datenbasierten Insights zu Kundenmeinungen, Märkten, Zielgruppen, Marken und ihren Social Media-Umfeldern zu versorgen.

Dein Aufgabenbereich

Datenbeschaffung / Toolbedienung

Du bist präzise, schnell, zuverlässig und motiviert, wenn es um die manuelle Erfassung großer (Social Media)- Datenmengen geht, aber auch wissbegierig und begeisterungsfähig, dich diesbezüglich kontinuierlich mit Prozessoptimierung zu befassen, sowie dich in Tools und automatisierte Datenerfassungsprozesse und Methoden einzudenken, um immer bessere Lösungen zu finden.

Datenstrukturierung, Effiziente Datensammlung, Query Writing, Kategorisierung und Datendarstellung werden hier deine täglichen Begleiter.

Studiendurchführung

Von der (manchmal noch recht schwammigen) Fragestellung bis zum fertigen Analysebericht mit guten Insights und Handlungsempfehlungen ist es oft ein weiter aber spannender Weg. Der kann bald auch deiner sein, gemeinsam mit uns im Team.

Du hast ein sehr gutes Gespür für Sprache und Kommunikation? Nice, das brauchst du hier in mindestens dreierlei Hinsicht: Erstens, um aus den Aussagen und Briefings unserer Auftraggeber herausfiltern zu können, wie du ihnen am besten weiterhelfen kannst. Zweitens, wenn es darum geht, die Essenz von Konsumenten-Posts und Kommentaren auf Social Media zu verstehen, schließlich ist Inhaltanalyse unser Daily-Business. Und Drittens, um dann Deine Findings Zielgruppengerecht rüberzubringen - in Reports, in Meetings und bei Präsentationen.

Datenanalyse

Auswertungslogiken passend zu den gegebenen Fragestellungen und Erkenntnisinteressen erstellen, Dimensionierungen & Kategorisierungen für Inhaltsanalysen planen und entwickeln, Daten auszählen, filtern, darstellen, vergleichen, interpretieren, daraus kreative Idee und Empfehlungen ableiten. Das ist dein Playground. Deine Affinität zu Zahlen und Daten kannst du hier immer wieder beweisen. Ein stets strukturiertes Vorgehen und ein souveräner Umgang auch mit großen und komplexen Datenmengen, Statistiken und Zahlen sind für dich selbstverständlich.

Spezielle Social Media Analyse-Tools wirst Du ebenso (kennenlernen und) zum Einsatz bringen wie ganz viel Excel und das gute alte Powerpoint.

Wenn du noch auf der Suche bist, bei „popkulturellem Relevanzmarketing“ neugierig wirst und für Social Media, Influencer Marketing oder Gaming &amp; Esports brennst, dann lass uns zusammen loslegen! Denn : Action Creates Impact .<br><br><strong>Dein Job<br><br></strong>Als <strong>(Junior) Insights Analyst</strong> (mensch) bearbeitest du als Teil unseres Data und Analytics Teams in erster Linie die Anfragen unserer Kunden nach Social Media Reportings sowie Social Listening Analysen und beherrschst den Spagat zwischen analytischem und kreativem Denken, um die Kolleg:Innen in deinem und anderen Teams mit datenbasierten Insights zu Kundenmeinungen, Märkten, Zielgruppen, Marken und ihren Social Media-Umfeldern zu versorgen.<br><br><strong>Dein Aufgabenbereich<br><br></strong><strong>Datenbeschaffung / Toolbedienung<br><br></strong>Du bist präzise, schnell, zuverlässig und motiviert, wenn es um die manuelle Erfassung großer (Social Media)- Datenmengen geht, aber auch wissbegierig und begeisterungsfähig, dich diesbezüglich kontinuierlich mit Prozessoptimierung zu befassen, sowie dich in Tools und automatisierte Datenerfassungsprozesse und Methoden einzudenken, um immer bessere Lösungen zu finden.<br><br>Datenstrukturierung, Effiziente Datensammlung, Query Writing, Kategorisierung und Datendarstellung werden hier deine täglichen Begleiter.<br><br><strong>Studiendurchführung<br><br></strong>Von der (manchmal noch recht schwammigen) Fragestellung bis zum fertigen Analysebericht mit guten Insights und Handlungsempfehlungen ist es oft ein weiter aber spannender Weg. Der kann bald auch deiner sein, gemeinsam mit uns im Team.<br><br>Du hast ein sehr gutes Gespür für Sprache und Kommunikation? Nice, das brauchst du hier in mindestens dreierlei Hinsicht: Erstens, um aus den Aussagen und Briefings unserer Auftraggeber herausfiltern zu können, wie du ihnen am besten weiterhelfen kannst. Zweitens, wenn es darum geht, die Essenz von Konsumenten-Posts und Kommentaren auf Social Media zu verstehen, schließlich ist Inhaltanalyse unser Daily-Business. Und Drittens, um dann Deine Findings Zielgruppengerecht rüberzubringen - in Reports, in Meetings und bei Präsentationen.<br><br><strong>Datenanalyse<br><br></strong>Auswertungslogiken passend zu den gegebenen Fragestellungen und Erkenntnisinteressen erstellen, Dimensionierungen &amp; Kategorisierungen für Inhaltsanalysen planen und entwickeln, Daten auszählen, filtern, darstellen, vergleichen, interpretieren, daraus kreative Idee und Empfehlungen ableiten. Das ist dein Playground. Deine Affinität zu Zahlen und Daten kannst du hier immer wieder beweisen.

Our small Canadian-born business was founded in 1978 and has become a global organization that now spans 120 locations across 20 countries. Our expansion has been rapid, but what matters most is the common belief that drives all 5,000 of our people to be a different type of real estate organization. We believe that the places in which we live, work and play have the power to make us happier and healthier, and we are united by a shared sense of purpose, to have a positive impact on people’s lives. In short, we are a global commercial real estate advisory firm with a simple aim: for real estate to play a leading role in creating vibrant buildings, cities and places that deliver long-lasting social value and economic impact.

Why Work For Us

We believe that our industry is changing, and we want our business to be a melting pot of curious minds, passionate hearts and strategic intelligence. Your gender, religion and race are all highly respected, but are less important to us than your ability to step up and change the game.

Collaboration is embedded in the way we work – our people have the autonomy to collaborate on client relationships, engage teams across the business, lead operations, work collectively on projects, participate in strategy and are ultimately responsible for our growth. Our distinctive Principal-led, privately-owned model puts us in the enviable position of being able to offer every employee the opportunity to own a share of our business and inspires and allows anyone to become a Principal. This role carries voting rights, so our people have a very real say in the future direction and operation of our business. This means that we are able to attract, engage and retain the best talent from the industry.

40% of all food produced in the world is wasted. And that has a huge impact on the health of our planet, with 10% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from food waste.

We’re more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation with a mission to empower everyone to take action against food waste, so alongside our marketplace app, we create educational tools, explore new business solutions - such as our Retail Technologies offering, and influence legislation to help reduce food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 113 million registered users and 240,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 419+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.132.000 tonnes of CO2e!

Your mission

We are seeking a talented and driven Data Analyst to join us in shaping the future of our newly established Demand Analytics team. The successful candidate will play a pivotal role in enhancing our team's capabilities around Marketing analytics while benefiting from a robust support structure designed to foster growth and innovation. We are also ready to consider candidates with more work experience as Senior Data Analyst.

As a Marketplace, Marketing is one of Too Good To Go’s most powerful levers for driving demand. Consequently, a strong foundation in marketing metrics is essential for this role. The models and methodologies you will help develop are largely marketing-focused, emphasizing the importance of experience with causal impact modeling and econometric modeling.

That said, Demand Analytics at Too Good To Go extends beyond Marketing. We are looking for someone who can also contribute to broader analytical initiatives, such as demand forecasting and other data-driven projects.

If you’re passionate about leveraging analytics to make a real-world impact and thrive in a dynamic, collaborative environment, we’d love to hear from you.

Your role


Support business leaders in identifying the right KPIs to drive business performance
Provide data-driven guidance to business leaders on key strategic decisions
Design and deliver self-service tools to various functional groups for operational excellence
Collaborate with marketing teams to optimize campaign strategies and resource allocation based on data-driven insights
Conduct in-depth analyses to identify the drivers of demand and measure marketing impact
Utilize marketing insights to inform and enhance demand forecasting models


Requirements


You have an understanding of Marketing Data and KPIs, or a strong appetite to learn this space.
Having experience in analyzing and interpreting marketing performance metrics would be a clear advantage.
You are a great communicator and storyteller - someone who enjoys helping non-technical audiences see what you see in the numbers!
You have hands-on experience working closely with senior stakeholders, ideally within Marketing, to deliver data-driven insights.
You are skilled in designing, executing, and interpreting A/B tests, as well as applying causal inference and impact modeling techniques.
You have econometric modeling experience; familiarity with marketing mix models (MMM) is a plus.
You are proficient in SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and transformation
You have Python expertise for data pre-processing, or statistical analysis. R would also be considered.
You are passionate about data literacy, continuously striving to improve your own skills and those of your team.


Our values


We win together: Food waste is a big beast to fight. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: We always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: Our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple.
We build a legacy: We’re proud of the change we’re driving.
We care: We always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.


What We Have To Offer


An opportunity to work in a global social-impact company and certified B Corporation! where you can see a real and tangible impact in your role.
To be an integral part of our Data & Analytics team. We are eager for you to make an impact and contribute to the role of analytics across key decisions and our solution processes. Your insights are valuable, and we are here to listen.
Work-life balance is important to us! Focus on the job to be done, not the hours spent, there is no need for overtime.
We trust in our employees and encourage an autonomous environment that provides several opportunities for employees to contribute, develop and take ownership of their work in a way that works for them.
To be part of an international company, with over 1,300+ colleagues across 19 countries that are on the same important mission.
An informal environment, working alongside 190+ passionate people within Tech & Product, mainly based in our HQ in Copenhagen.
We celebrate our differences and our successes and have a strong values-driven team culture.
We work in a hybrid set-up and value in office work weekly. Our London office is located in Shoreditch.

Our small Canadian-born business was founded in 1978 and has become a global organization that now spans 120 locations across 20 countries.

We believe that the places in which we live, work and play have the power to make us happier and healthier, and we are united by a shared sense of purpose, to have a positive impact on people’s lives.

40% of all food produced in the world is wasted. And that has a huge impact on the health of our planet, with 10% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from food waste.

We’re more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation with a mission to empower everyone to take action against food waste, so alongside our marketplace app, we create educational tools, explore new business solutions - such as our Retail Technologies offering, and influence legislation to help reduce food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 113 million registered users and 240,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 419+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.132.000 tonnes of CO2e!

Your mission

We are seeking a talented and driven Data Analyst to join us in shaping the future of our newly established Demand Analytics team. The successful candidate will play a pivotal role in enhancing our team's capabilities around Marketing analytics while benefiting from a robust support structure designed to foster growth and innovation. We are also ready to consider candidates with more work experience as Senior Data Analyst.

As a Marketplace, Marketing is one of Too Good To Go’s most powerful levers for driving demand. Consequently, a strong foundation in marketing metrics is essential for this role. The models and methodologies you will help develop are largely marketing-focused, emphasizing the importance of experience with causal impact modeling and econometric modeling.

That said, Demand Analytics at Too Good To Go extends beyond Marketing. We are looking for someone who can also contribute to broader analytical initiatives, such as demand forecasting and other data-driven projects.

If you’re passionate about leveraging analytics to make a real-world impact and thrive in a dynamic, collaborative environment, we’d love to hear from you.

Your role


Support business leaders in identifying the right KPIs to drive business performance
Provide data-driven guidance to business leaders on key strategic decisions
Design and deliver self-service tools to various functional groups for operational excellence
Collaborate with marketing teams to optimize campaign strategies and resource allocation based on data-driven insights
Conduct in-depth analyses to identify the drivers of demand and measure marketing impact
Utilize marketing insights to inform and enhance demand forecasting models


Requirements


You have an understanding of Marketing Data and KPIs, or a strong appetite to learn this space.
Having experience in analyzing and interpreting marketing performance metrics would be a clear advantage.
You are a great communicator and storyteller - someone who enjoys helping non-technical audiences see what you see in the numbers!
You have hands-on experience working closely with senior stakeholders, ideally within Marketing, to deliver data-driven insights.
You are skilled in designing, executing, and interpreting A/B tests, as well as applying causal inference and impact modeling techniques.
You have econometric modeling experience; familiarity with marketing mix models (MMM) is a plus.
You are proficient in SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and transformation
You have Python expertise for data pre-processing, or statistical analysis. R would also be considered.
You are passionate about data literacy, continuously striving to improve your own skills and those of your team.


Our values


We win together: Food waste is a big beast to fight. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: We always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: Our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple.
We build a legacy: We’re proud of the change we’re driving.
We care: We always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.


What We Have To Offer


An opportunity to work in a global social-impact company and certified B Corporation! where you can see a real and tangible impact in your role.
To be an integral part of our Data & Analytics team. We are eager for you to make an impact and contribute to the role of analytics across key decisions and our solution processes. Your insights are valuable, and we are here to listen.
Work-life balance is important to us! Focus on the job to be done, not the hours spent, there is no need for overtime.
We trust in our employees and encourage an autonomous environment that provides several opportunities for employees to contribute, develop and take ownership of their work in a way that works for them.

﻿﻿Experience in defining and creating metrics for consumption by our BI tool and other services
﻿﻿Experience using data visualisation tools. We use Looker and experience here will be a big bonus, but other tools & experiences are of course still relevant

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you’ll do

About The Internship Experience

Our internship program provides the opportunity to work on meaningful business initiatives that will grow the GDP of the internet. Through the internship, you will work with many systems and technologies, gain experience in working with large datasets and analytical methodologies/tools to help us better understand our users and build better products.

Each intern has a dedicated mentor, and every intern project is part of the team's roadmap that will directly contribute to Stripe's mission. As you collaborate with industry experts on initiatives that expand global commerce, you will develop a strong first-hand understanding of the role analytics plays in steering business strategy and results.

So why — despite the huge leaps we've taken in design and usability — does most business phone software still look, feel, and act like it was born in the 90s? OpenPhone is changing that.

We’re a new type of business phone with a mission to help people communicate better and be more productive.

We’re backed by Y Combinator and some of the best venture firms around including Tiger Global, Craft Ventures, Slow Ventures, and others. We take pride in providing an exceptional customer experience and a product people love, which is why we’re excited that our customers have rated us the #1 VoIP Provider on G2.

OpenPhone is the modern, sophisticated answer to the clunky, outdated phone systems that have been slowing down businesses for years. With thousands of happy customers and several rounds of funding in just five years, it's safe to say we're onto something big.

About The Role

We are hiring a Data Analyst with 4+ years of experience to primarily support our Go-To-Market (GTM) teams by providing insights and reporting to drive strategic decision-making. The ideal candidate will have strong analytical skills, experience with SQL, BI reporting tools, and a passion for translating data into actionable business insights.

Some Of The Things You’ll Do


Develop and maintain dashboards and reports using BI tools (e.g., Mode, Tableau) to support GTM teams.
Analyze marketing, advertising, and sales data, including conversion funnel and cohort retention analyses, slicing data by attribution models, and providing customer lifecycle insights.
Collaborate with stakeholders across sales, marketing, and customer success to define key metrics and reporting needs.
Write efficient SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data from various sources.
Assist in data modeling and transformation using dbt (a plus but not required).
Comfortable with working large and complex data coming from multiple sources such as Kafka events or web traffic data from ad platforms.
Communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Ensure data accuracy, integrity, and security in all reporting and analysis efforts.


About You


4+ years of experience in data analysis, preferably in a SaaS environment.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills with a quantitative mindset.
Familiarity with analytics engineering and dbt (a plus).
Excellent communication skills with the ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical audiences.
Ability to thrive in a high-paced, high-growth environment.
Experience managing data projects and collaborating with cross-functional teams.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists, and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you’ll do

About The Internship Experience

Our internship program provides the opportunity to work on meaningful business initiatives that will grow the GDP of the internet. Through the internship, you will work with many systems and technologies, gain experience in working with large datasets and analytical methodologies/tools to help us better understand our users and build better products.

Each intern has a dedicated mentor, and every intern project is part of the team's roadmap that will directly contribute to Stripe's mission. As you collaborate with industry experts on initiatives that expand global commerce, you will develop a strong first-hand understanding of the role analytics plays in steering business strategy and results.

Partner closely with Data Scientists, Data Analysts, and business partners to drive business impact through rigorous analytical solutions

Who you are

Minimum Requirements

Enrolled in a quantitative Master's program (e.g. Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, Statistics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2025 or spring/summer 2026
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Experience communicating and collaborating with multidisciplinary stakeholders in a team environment



Preferred Qualifications

You also likely have:


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $135,200 - $135,200. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

The Senior Analyst, Data and Analytics, reports to the Manager of Data and Analytics in the Quality division of the Clinical Institutes and Quality Programs portfolio. The Senior Analyst will support the development of primary data analysis and reporting content for emerging provincial quality issues, high-priority initiatives, and quality programs (e.g., Clinical and Quality Standards, Quality Improvement Plans, the Ontario Surgical Quality Improvement Network, the Emergency Department Return Visit Quality Program). In doing so, they will use Ontario’s health administrative databases and concise evidence-based guidance with associated quality indicators developed by Ontario Health.

The Senior Analyst will use their research and data analytical skills and their knowledge of Ontario’s health care data to support the analyses of administrative and clinical data to identify areas of Ontario’s health care system that suggest quality gaps between current practice and optimal care. They will provide descriptive analyses on populations and service areas of interest, examine and interpret regional and institutional variations in utilization and outcomes, and compare data on practice patterns and performance with those of other health care systems. They will identify and leverage the findings of relevant existing published research and combine these with their own primary data analysis to develop analytical plans and reporting products.

The Senior Analyst will support the development of analytical methodology using health administrative and clinical data sources, create internal and external information products, and derive actionable insights to support quality improvement and performance management. They will work in cross-functional teams with stakeholders with varying degrees of technical knowledge to identify analysis requirements, inform indicator development, and prepare and analyze data to support other initiatives within the Quality division. In collaboration with the Lead and Manager of Data Analytics, they may also be responsible for communicating information to program areas across Ontario Health, as well as to external stakeholders, subject matter experts, and organizations.

This will involve performing rigorous product deep dives, identifying opportunities for product enhancements, and measuring the impact of new features.

The Verticals team encompasses 3 critical and unique products / marketplaces within Lyft: airports, scheduled rides, and events. Airports are one of the most important, impactful, and complex parts of Lyft’s Rideshare business, as they are a key part of both the rider and driver Lyft experience and have unique dynamics. Scheduled rides allow riders to book a ride in advance with high reliability, and enable drivers to add structure to their work schedule. Lastly, events such as concerts or sporting games require similar considerations of special operations to ensure a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.

What is driving high cancellation rates today and which types of riders/drivers are cancelling? What product changes can we implement to reduce cancellation rates for scheduled rides?
How are riders and drivers using different ride modes at airports and events, and how do we design products to address this behavior?
How are riders and drivers discovering scheduled rides and are there entry point optimizations we can implement?


Responsibilities:


Leverage data and analytic frameworks to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency across Verticals products, recommending solutions to drive business impact
Understand the complex business dynamics across the Verticals product areas, specifically how these products differ from traditional rideshare marketplaces, to propose enhancements that compliment Lyft-wide products
Partner with product managers, engineers, marketers, designers, and operators to translate data insights into decisions and action
Develop dashboards and analytical frameworks to monitor business and product performance
Establish metrics that measure the health of our products, the business, as well as the rider and driver experiences


Experience:


5-7+ years of experience in data analytics in a high-growth environment
Degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, economics, applied math, operations research or engineering (an asset, advanced degrees also an asset)
End-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, analysis, and visualization
Ability to manage, influence, negotiate, and inspire others in a fast-moving environment
Proficient in SQL and quantitative analysis, you can deep dive into large amounts of data, draw meaningful insights, dissect business issues and draw actionable conclusions
Outcome-driven approach to developing recommendations and demonstrated ability to develop a story and execution plan to support goals and objectives
Exceptional communication (listening, written, and oral) skills with the ability to present findings and recommendations targeted to the audience in question.
A drive to understand the core issues along with the determination to uncover the solution
Thrives within ambiguity and context-switching

Designing novel mechanisms and incentive schemes
Building models and simulations to evaluate investment opportunities
Designing and parameterizing trading systems
Optimizing parameters for production applications
Contributing to the design of Economics programs and applications
You'll optimize network incentives and systems by engaging directly with the Economics, Product, Engineering, Research, and Data Science teams to understand network dynamics at the deepest level.
You'll operationalize processes and analytics systems, and coordinate cross-functionally to implement them.
This is both a highly technical and highly social role. You will have high visibility and a large impact on how Chainlink builds the world’s first fully sustainable decentralized oracle network.

Requirements
