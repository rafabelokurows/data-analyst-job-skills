Job Summary

The Research Data Analyst functions as a statistical analyst for the UCSF Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy, and Sleep Medicine supporting divisional principal investigators. The Research Data Analyst will primarily be responsible for developing and conducting complex statistical analyses and providing database development and management.

The Research Data Analyst is specifically tailored to work on exposure-related lung diseases. The lung is constantly exposed to various environmental pollutants, allergens, and toxins, which interact with airways and alveoli and result in inflammation, injury, and disease. The specific laboratory that houses this position is focused on the paradigm that respiratory exposures to pollutants and toxicants contribute to development and progression of chronic lung diseases, and may further yield systemic effects well beyond lungs. Under this paradigm, the research activities have focused on understanding the physiologic and immunologic mechanisms via which environmental exposures contribute to chronic lung diseases and how knowledge of these mechanisms could be translated to ways to better define, prognosticate, and manage disease burden at both individual and societal levels.

The Research Data Analyst will use skills as an experienced research professional with an in-depth understanding of biostatistics and research software programming techniques to oversee and conduct the statistical component of new and ongoing protocols. The analyst will work closely with research team members (e.g., principal investigators, research managers, trainees, CRCs, etc.) to support the conduct of the research. The individual will help manage, analyze, interpret, and report on statistical findings. Specifically, the individual will conduct complex statistical analyses and prepare findings for presentation at professional meeting and publication in medical journals.


NOTE: This is a part-time (50%) Contract role for 1 year.


The final salary and offer components are subject to additional approvals based on UC policy.

Your placement within the salary range is dependent on a number of factors including your work experience and internal equity within this position classification at UCSF. For positions that are represented by a labor union, placement within the salary range will be guided by the rules in the collective bargaining agreement.

The salary range for this position is $87,900 - $126,900 (Annual Rate).

Collaborate with the rest of the data organization at Strava (Machine Learning, Data Platform, etc) to collectively improve our technological craftsmanship.

You have hands-on experience working with statistical programming languages (e.g. R, Python) for data wrangling and modeling.
You are comfortable managing concurrent projects and meeting goals, even in the context of competing deadlines or priorities.

4184912175,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/senior-data-analyst-at-homeward-4184912175?position=56&pageNum=0&refId=GYCbiwUizHYc3gWARiKR0w%3D%3D&trackingId=iywZoB8Pwhpn16DmBP2w3w%3D%3D,Senior Data Analyst,Homeward,"San Francisco, CA","Homeward is rearchitecting the delivery of health and care in partnership with communities everywhere, starting in rural America. Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities. In fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.

Our vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we're creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality. Homeward supports Medicare-eligible beneficiaries by partnering with health plans, providers, and communities to align incentives – taking full financial accountability for clinical outcomes and the total cost of care across rural counties.

As a public benefit corporation and Certified B Corp™, Homeward's mission and business model are aligned to address the healthcare, economic, and demographic challenges that make it challenging for rural Americans to stay healthy. Our Homeward Navigation™ platform uses advanced analytics to connect members to the right care and local resources that address social determinants of health and improve holistic health outcomes. Since many rural communities lack adequate clinical capacity, Homeward also employs care teams that supplement local practices and reach people who cannot otherwise access care.

Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo's products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding. With this leadership team and funding, Homeward is committed to bringing high-quality healthcare to rural communities in need.

The Opportunity

Join us in tackling healthcare for rural America! We're seeking a Senior Data Analyst who is passionate about having a positive societal impact and using technology for good – solving issues of health inequity for communities that have been perennially underserved. As a Senior Data Analyst, you'll join our Data Analytics and Data Science team as a strong ""all-arounder"" in the analytics space. You will leverage your proven track record for success in healthcare analytics to take ownership of business intelligence, member engagement, and operational reporting and complete ad-hoc analyses to support various functions across the business.

What you'll do:


Identify needs and deliver analytic products – from formal business intelligence products to ad-hoc analytics
Develop, mature, and deliver our business intelligence strategy across the enterprise, across growth, clinical delivery, quality, and cost results for internal and external audiences
Collaborate with stakeholders to identify highest-priority analytic questions, analyze relevant data, and generate actionable insights that enable improvement
Develop systems and processes to use our data effectively, accurately, and efficiently across the enterprise
Collaborate with our Technology team to deliver requirements on the highest priority data sources and most appropriate structures for analytics
Standardize and transform data into data structures that support operational reporting


What you bring:


3+ years of experience in data analysis and/or business intelligence development
Demonstrated orientation toward ensuring data quality and accuracy on a case-by-case basis and at scale
Strong technical skills necessary to perform advanced analytics: coding ( SQL, Python, R) and experience with data management (dbt) and visualization tools (Tableau, Metabase, Looker)
Collaborative spirit and ability to drive analyses with technical and non-technical stakeholders
Ability to zoom in with attention to detail and also zoom out to see the big picture
Strong communicator of questions, challenges, opportunities, and results to technical and non-technical audiences


Bonus Points:


Expertise in Medicare data including claims, EHR data, provider data, HEDIS, Star Ratings, risk adjustment as well as value-based care analytics
Experience with the TUVA Project
Experience with marketing measurement, attribution, forecasting, capacity management, and experimental test design and evaluation
Experience building and consolidating longitudinal data from multiple sources
Experience with QA validation and automation tools
Previous experience building from the ground up on a small, fast-paced team


What shapes our company:


Deep commitment to one another, the people and communities we serve, and to care that enables everyone to achieve their best health
Compassion and empathy
Curiosity, and an eagerness to listen
Drive to deliver high-quality experiences, clinical care, and cost-effectiveness
Strong focus on sustainability of our business and scalability of our services, to maximize our reach and impact
Nurturing a diverse workforce, with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and points of view
Taking our mission and business seriously, but not taking ourselves too seriously– having fun as we build!


Benefits:


Competitive salary, equity grant, generous paid time off
Comprehensive benefits package including medical, dental & vision insurance with 100% of monthly premium covered for employees
Company-sponsored 401k plan
Flexible working arrangement


The base salary range for this position is $140,000 - $165,000 annually. Compensation may vary outside of this range depending on a number of factors, including a candidate's qualifications, skills, location, competencies and experience. Base pay is one part of the total compensation package that is provided to compensate and recognize employees for their work at Homeward Health. This role is eligible for an annual bonus, stock options, as well as a comprehensive benefits package.

At Homeward, a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences enrich our teams and allow us to achieve above and beyond our goals.

Built by engineers for engineers, The Teleport Access Platform delivers on-demand, least privileged access to infrastructure based on cryptographic identity and zero trust, with built-in identity security and policy governance, making the happy path for engineers the secure path.

Teleport is trusted by the world’s fastest-moving companies, including Elastic, Snowflake, Doordash, and NASDAQ. We recently raised US$110M at a US$1.1B valuation.

Our Vision

Today's computing environments have too much complexity, too many network boundaries, and too little trust. Complexity slows engineers down and leads to human errors. Complex systems can’t be secure despite the red tape of bureaucracy. We make trusted computing simple. This gives engineers the freedom to move and build a better future.

Why Teleport

At Teleport, we focus on empowering our people to accomplish their goals by working alongside highly talented people to make the most of their careers. You have the freedom, autonomy and trust to do what you’re great at and have a significant impact on the future prospects of the company. 

Whether that’s taking a feature or project from ideation to deployment or working with some of the biggest, most interesting companies in the world and solving real challenges for them, we want you to help us build the future.

We’re not a big company. You won’t get lost in a crowd. Instead, we move fast, with a team that wants to make an impact, that shares in our success, and gives you the freedom, power, and autonomy to become the very best at what you do.

Who you are - To succeed at Teleport and take your career into the future, we are looking for people who are:
Autonomous: We value those who take initiative and get things done. Our team trusts in their ability to make decisions that benefit the company and its customers, letting their work speak for itself
Security-minded: Working on the very fabric of the internet and providing infrastructure access to some of the world’s biggest companies means you need to think security-first. Our platform is the gatekeeper - The Wall. And winter is coming. We need to ensure we’re secure
Business-savvy: We don’t code for coding's sake. We build for our customers. Designed by engineers for engineers, we understand their environment, challenges and needs better than anyone else. That means we have built a business that can support them by making the right choices that ensure we are in business for the long haul
Professional: We are a team of dedicated professionals, committed to excellence. We set a high bar for joining Teleport, ensuring we attract top talent ready to help shape the future. If you’re passionate about being the best at what you do, Teleport is the place for you

The Benefits

While many companies flaunt their benefits and perks to convince you to join their company, we believe your career is more important than that. That’s why we focus on making your day-to-day the best it can be while empowering you to achieve your goals and aspirations. 

What does that mean?

- It means you’ll have the autonomy to make your own decisions and focus on what’s important to you and your role.

- It means having access to a senior team that supports you and wants to see you succeed.

- You’ll have a smart team you can learn from, collaborate with, and grow with.

- It means being able to make an impact and have a voice in the future of the feature, product or company direction. We don’t just leave you to focus on a niche. We allow you to spread your wings and take advantage of opportunities, challenging projects and exciting problems.

- It means removing the bureaucracy and red tape that stifles innovation while giving you access to all the information you need to build and take action more quickly. 

- It means allowing you to have the career you’ve always wanted today, rather than having to “earn your stripes” and wait for the right moment. If you’re good enough, you’re good enough.

But we don’t stop there.

In addition to the career opportunities at Teleport, we offer a whole range of benefits that help you to maximize your future, including:

- Extensive health coverage

- Annual expense budget

- Rest & recovery policies that maximize leave and your ability to recharge

- Investment in your future with retirement savings plans

Do you have what it takes?

Get to use (and know) Teleport through our unique interview process 

At Teleport, we do things a bit differently. And when we say we only hire top talent, we actually mean it. Because of this, our interview process is different too - and we’re proud of it.  We let your work do the talking. We don’t go in for six rounds of interviews, live whiteboard or live-coding. We don’t hire people that can talk a good game. We only want the best. And for that, we need to see what you can do,  in your own time, in your own way.  For real.

But interviews are a two-way street. Through the project, you’ll get a real taste of life at Teleport, including: 

- We’re flexible - you’ll have plenty of time to complete your project, if life gets in the way, that’s ok. We can - work around you. 

- We give you autonomy  - you’ll have the space and freedom to figure things out, make decisions, and problem-solve.

- We’re collaborative -  Got questions?

- We have answers. You’ll have support from your team - the one you’ll be working with day in day out if you’re successful in getting the role.

- We progress careers - During the project,  see how much you learn. That’s what working at Teleport is like. We like learning, on the job. All-the-time. 

- We can move fast (if you can) - two weeks sound like a long time? No problem? Early submissions are fine, and we’ll keep the process moving. 

Think you’ve got what it takes? We’d love to see it! Unconvinced? We can guarantee three things: 

- It’ll challenge you.

- You'll learn a lot. 

- If you love the process, you'll love working at Teleport.

Zaandam - 40 uur per week

Wil jij graag bepalen welke producten in onze winkels gevoerd worden en jouw werk terugzien op de schappen in meer dan 1.250 winkels? Zie jij jezelf daarbij meewerken aan gave projecten op het snijvlak van commercie en analytics? En ben je op zoek naar een leuk team waar hard werken in combinatie gaat met humor en gezelligheid? Dan is deze baan zeker iets voor jou!




Albert Heijn vult met 125.000 collega’s, verdeeld over ruim 1.250 winkels in Nederland en Vlaanderen, negen home shop centers, zeven distributiecentra en ons hoofdkantoor elke avond ruim zeven miljoen borden.




Jouw nieuwe baan en werkplek.

Als Data Analist Assortiment bij Albert Heijn maak jij impact door te zorgen dat het juiste assortiment op de beste plek in de schappen van onze ruim 1.250 winkels wordt gepresenteerd. Je werkt op het snijvlak van het belang van de klant, commercie en onze winkels. Een uitdagende rol, waarbij je als belangrijke drijver achter grote assortimentsveranderingen nadenkt over hoe we iedere klant optimaal kunnen bedienen, zo veel mogelijk resultaat kunnen behalen én tegelijkertijd zo min mogelijk producten hoeven af te prijzen of weg te gooien. En dit doen we door continue bij te sturen. Dit alles doe je natuurlijk niet alleen: je werkt veel samen met de afdeling Commercie om kansen te presenteren en initiatieven te ontwikkelen en Analytics om onze assortiment modellen te verbeteren. Met jouw focus op ons assortiment, haarscherpe analyses en lef ben je in staat om vernieuwende inzichten te geven, de juiste partijen bij elkaar te brengen én zorg je dat alle doelen op tijd worden gerealiseerd. Je bent hierbij dé sparringpartner van de Category Manager op het gebied van assortiment: je denkt met hem/haar mee en stuurt hierbij op het juiste eindresultaat. Dat komt neer op een ideale mix van een commerciële mindset, de wil om te blijven verbeteren waarbij je een beroep kan doen op jouw skills in projectmanagement en procesbewaking.




In deze functie werk je 40 uur per week, deels vanuit het hoofdkantoor in Zaandam en deels vanuit huis.




Dit ga je als Data Analist Assortiment bij ons doen.

Je signaleert continue kansen op het gebied van assortiment en zet deze om tot concrete inzichten en acties tijdens integrale ‘deep-dives’.
Je bent de sparringpartner voor bijvoorbeeld Category Managers. Je neemt hen mee en overtuigt hen van met vernieuwende inzichten of voorstellen als het gaat om continue het juiste assortiment voor klant en winkel bieden.
Je analyseert het assortiment op basis van performance data en gebruikt daarvoor big data-applicaties zoals PowerBI en Assortiment Optimization. Hiermee vertaal je de data in specifieke assortimentsadviezen.
Je weet verzoeken vanuit Commercie voor schapanalyse en ruimteverdeling te vertalen naar kansen en commerciële plannen en draagt zorg voor de implementatie daarvan.
Je stuurt continu op kansen in assortiment. Denk aan assortiment met hoge derving, lage marge, kansen op biologisch of producten met een slechte beschikbaarheid.
Je biedt end-to-end begeleiding bij het proces voor veranderingen van assortiment in de winkel waarbij je verschillende afdelingen binnen Albert Heijn (Concept Development, Winkel Support, Merchandising, Strategy en Analytics) aanhaakt, informeert en samenbrengt.




We vinden het belangrijk dat jij bij Albert Heijn jezelf kunt zijn in een omgeving die openstaat voor verschillende perspectieven, een omgeving waarin we nieuwsgierig zijn en elkaar waarderen. Voor deze functie zoeken we bij voorkeur iemand die de diversiteit in ons team, in de breedste zin van het woord, versterkt. Iemand die vanuit eigen achtergrond en persoonlijke eigenschappen een ander geluid brengt en daarmee een goede aanvulling is op ons team.




Dit bieden we jou.

We betalen je inzet terug met een bruto jaarsalaris tussen €50.800 en €61.700 - afhankelijk van je ervaring. Dit bedrag is inclusief 8% vakantiegeld.
Je werkt mee aan onze groei en ontvangt daarom een gegarandeerde winstuitkering.
Je kunt 45 (ja, vijf-en-veertig) dagen met vakantie: je krijgt 25,5 vaste vakantiedagen en 19,5 Adv-dagen.
Een uitstekende pensioenregeling bij het Ahold Delhaize Pensioenfonds.
Een reiskostenvergoeding of NS-trajectkaart om van en naar Zaandam te reizen.
10% korting op je boodschappen bij Albert Heijn, tot maximaal €300 per jaar.
Verdere doorgroeimogelijkheden in de Albert Heijn en/of Ahold Delhaize organisatie.
Een Mijn Albert Heijn Premium abonnement met vele voordelen.
Via onze Albert Heijn Deals ontvang je exclusieve kortingen op leuke uitjes en producten van grote merken.
Een inclusieve omgeving waarin je op persoonlijk en vakinhoudelijk vlak continu kan blijven ontwikkelen.




Dit breng je mee.

Met onze 125.000 collega’s vullen we elke avond ruim zeven miljoen borden. En als het aan ons ligt, doen we dat binnenkort ook samen met jou als onze nieuwe Data Analist Assortiment. Zeker als je jouw commerciële kennis en analytische blik naar Albert Heijn meebrengt. Ook heb je:

Een afgeronde WO-opleiding, bij voorkeur in de richting van Economie of Bedrijfskunde.
Circa 3-5 jaar werkervaring liefst in een commerciële, trade marketing of consulting rol.
Je hebt affiniteit met assortiment en presentatie, kwantitatieve analyses en automatiseringssoftware
Je bent thuis in een Retail- of FMCG-omgeving.
Ervaring met Consultancy en/of onze winkels is een flink pluspunt.
Als je, net als wij, graag onderdeel bent van een team dat hard werken combineert met humor en gezelligheid, helemaal top!




Daarnaast ben je:

Analytisch, een must voor deze baan! Je kan snel problemen en oorzaken onderkennen, je ziet samenhang tussen onderwerpen, software en behoudt structuur en overzicht. Je interpreteert grote datasets en vertaalt deze naar inzichten richting de business en naar regels voor modellen.
Een denker in oplossingen en lekker proactief, je deinst niet terug voor complexe uitdagingen op het snijvlak van business, software en algoritmes.
Resultaatgericht: je weet concrete commerciële resultaten en/of doelstellingen te behalen. Je geeft niet op bij tegenslagen en houdt de uitgezette lijn voor ogen.
Overtuigend, je kan verschillende stakeholders overtuigen van onderbouwde ideeën en houdt daarbij rekening met mogelijke weerstand. Ook ben je in staat een boodschap krachtig, doelgericht en duidelijk over te brengen.
Flexibel/wendbaar en in staat je (snel) aan te passen aan veranderende omstandigheden of werkwijze, blijft daarbij kalm en houdt overzicht.
Verbindend, je bent je bewust van anderen, kan effectief de samenwerking opzoeken en verwachtingen van collega’s begrijpen en hier het eigen gedrag waar nodig op aanpassen.
Ondernemend, je wacht ontwikkelingen niet af, maar bent proactief en onderneemt zelf actie en stelt zaken ter discussie.

Work with internal Customer Success and Support data to find key improvement metrics on process and product
Help provide feedback to Hearsay Systems’ Product team on customer and company data needs
