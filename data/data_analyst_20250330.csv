Agreena is an exciting, dynamic, and purpose-oriented organisation united in a mission to mobilise farmers and corporations to unlock the value of nature and help restore the planet. While we’re rooted in agriculture, finance, and technology, our team of experts range from soil carbon scientists and software developers to market strategists and regulatory affairs experts. Over 160 employees across more than 30 nationalities are gathered under the common Agreena flag – either working from our headquarters in Copenhagen, offices in London, or remotely across Europe.

As a rapidly scaling climate agtech, Agreena provides solutions that drive both environmental and financial sustainability in farming. We have helped farmers across 20 countries in their journey from conventional agriculture to regenerative farming practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, storing it in soil. Our company offers a supportive and positive work environment with opportunities for learning, leading and growth no matter where you are in your professional journey. We believe in giving our employees a lot of responsibility, and we encourage new thinking, innovation and fun.

We are looking for an in-house statistician to assist our Programme and Data teams. Across both, we are looking to better understand and explain our data in order to bolster our scientific rigour. You will sit between both teams and should be confident working with different types of statistical analysis, process-based modelling, and sampling/stratification.

Equally, you should have a good understanding of statistical modelling and bring a fresh perspective to our machine learning and process-based approaches. Thus, you will be a strong communicator capable of translating complex analysis into simplified insights to both internal and external stakeholders.

The Programme and Data teams are integral to the scientific operations of the company, and you will work closely together with them and our Product teams to ensure state of the art science drives our world leading carbon platform. As such, you will be part of a dynamic and high-paced work environment constantly subject to innovation.

How Will You Make An Impact


Estimating uncertainty and error propagation in our models;
Applying Bayesian methods for the calibration of complex process-based models;
Designing sampling strategies for our data collection campaigns;
Evaluating the quality and quantity of our data;
Communicating and visualising key insights;


Who We’re Looking For


Self-driven individual capable of collaborating in a multi-disciplinary environment;
Minimum Bachelors in Statistics, Mathematics, or appropriate science/engineering field;
3+ years of experience working in a relevant field, with experience in some or all of the following:
Statistical and data-sampling techniques such as regression, imputation, random forest, Monte Carlo, stratification, and/or clustering;
Working with temporal and spatial data;
Experience coding in R;
Strong scientific writing, report creation and communication skills to audiences with a range of technical expertise.


Bonus Points If You Have


Masters or PhD in one of the relevant Science fields mentioned above;
A baseline understanding of greenhouse gas accounting frameworks and methodologies;
Strong theoretical background in Bayesian Statistics;
Knowledge or experience working with crop, pedometrics, or process-based models;
Experience coding in Python;
Handling unstructured/imbalanced data.


What’s In It For You


A unique opportunity to join and help shape a fast-growing tech scale up with the determination and ambitious mission to reverse climate change;
A truly global environment where you can collaborate and socialise with diverse and passionate colleagues;
Competitive compensation package and holidays;
Centrally located modern office in Copenhagen or London and the option to work from home a couple days a week;
Team events throughout the year;
An exciting purpose-led culture and mission;

Data insight and analytics is core to our decision-making at Mous, and a highly valued skill for anyone in the business. We’re looking for someone passionate and ambitious to help us grow Analytics at Mous.

📱 About Us

We are Mous. (Pronounced mouse, not moose.) Our vision is for everyone to live better with technology. With an in-house team of expert product engineers and designers, we’re constantly evolving in a rapidly changing market. We make high-performance tech accessories and innovative product ecosystems, crafted with purpose, and demonstrate their value through impactful content. We believe in show, not tell, so we produce extreme content to prove what our products can do, including throwing phones from helicopters, cranes and even the roof at Google HQ in California.

We started by designing a phone case that focused on high performance, optimal functionality and considered style. We have since expanded our product range to include ecosystems of MagSafe® compatible magnetic accessories, mechanical mounts for content creation and bikes, ultra-fast wireless chargers, and backpacks that all adhere to these principles.

Our products are for risk-takers and thrill-seekers as well as tech-lovers and city dwellers. We create solutions to the problems that come from busy lives and outlandish adventures. No matter what your everyday life looks like you can trust our products to expand the experiences you have with the tech you use the most.

You are not only detail-oriented but also capable of seeing the bigger picture, transforming complex data sets into actionable insights. Your adaptability and desire to continuously learn make you an ideal candidate for navigating the dynamic landscape of eCommerce. A collaborative team player, you excel at communicating complex data findings in a clear, concise manner, making data accessible to all levels of the company.

You will be pivotal in understanding and addressing the data needs of various departments, including Ecommerce, Pricing, and Growth.

You will be at the forefront of promoting a data-driven culture, empowering the organisation through informed decision-making and self-sufficient data management.

Create and refine dynamic dashboards to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and objectives and key results (OKRs), enhancing decision-making processes.
Proactively identify areas for improvement within the company's processes and systems and implement automated solutions.
Lead and support strategic cross-department initiatives to drive value. E.g. Pricing Optimisation, Segmentation Analysis, Marketing Mix Modelling.
Support in building out fundamental data sources, to allow analysis of data from multiple key platforms.


🤓 Skills Requirements


A genuine passion and dedication to kick-starting your career at a start-up.
A 2:1 degree or higher under your belt (although this isn't a prerequisite)
Strong problem solver – never afraid to get stuck into the detail to uncover insights.
A knack for numbers with the confidence to tackle and interpret large, complex data sets.
A level of attention to detail that will put us all to shame! You'll understand that your accuracy is critical for the correct setup of our digital channels.
Use your strong communication skills to manage both internal stakeholders (ensuring effective planning and briefing of campaigns and execution) and external stakeholders to build lasting relationships.
A demonstrable commercial understanding with the ability to value and prioritise work ruthlessly.
Proven analytical and Excel/Power BI skills to build and evaluate hypotheses using data, with exposure to AB testing.
Agile and scrappy – you are action biased, embrace uncertainty with the tenacity to see things through to the end.

Enjoy The Ride


We invite everyone at Mous to grab new opportunities and find ways to make each role their own. Things can change fast in an unpredictable industry like ours, so we always want to stay agile.

We strive to be different and know that if we are to create the most innovative products and deliver the best customer experience, we need to build a diverse team of individuals who can bring a variety of skills, experiences, and perspectives to the table. No matter your age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, or physical ability, at Mous, your individuality is celebrated.

As a D2C business and heavy user of plastics, we understand (and take very seriously) our responsibility to the planet. To stay true to our word, we've placed ""Planet"" firmly in our key business objectives and have formed a dedicated team, alongside our cofounders, to build an ESG plan we're proud of. Ultimately, we want to create a better world through our actions and we're doing so across our products, how we transport from A to B, and socially.

Our small Canadian-born business was founded in 1978 and has become a global organization that now spans 120 locations across 20 countries. Our expansion has been rapid, but what matters most is the common belief that drives all 5,000 of our people to be a different type of real estate organization. We believe that the places in which we live, work and play have the power to make us happier and healthier, and we are united by a shared sense of purpose, to have a positive impact on people’s lives. In short, we are a global commercial real estate advisory firm with a simple aim: for real estate to play a leading role in creating vibrant buildings, cities and places that deliver long-lasting social value and economic impact.

Why Work For Us

We believe that our industry is changing, and we want our business to be a melting pot of curious minds, passionate hearts and strategic intelligence. Your gender, religion and race are all highly respected, but are less important to us than your ability to step up and change the game.

Collaboration is embedded in the way we work – our people have the autonomy to collaborate on client relationships, engage teams across the business, lead operations, work collectively on projects, participate in strategy and are ultimately responsible for our growth. Our distinctive Principal-led, privately-owned model puts us in the enviable position of being able to offer every employee the opportunity to own a share of our business and inspires and allows anyone to become a Principal. This role carries voting rights, so our people have a very real say in the future direction and operation of our business. This means that we are able to attract, engage and retain the best talent from the industry.

That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Let’s kick things off with a quick intro. Jane is a team that’s all about fostering growth, spreading delight, and serving our healthcare community. We’re looking for people who are ready to jump in and join us as we simplify the lives of healthcare practitioners and patients every day.

At Jane, success means collaborating with your team, delivering an aligned result with efficiency and quality, communicating clearly and openly, and embracing continuous improvement. And guess what? Jane is a remote-first company, so every role, including this one, gives you the freedom to work from anywhere in Canada.

Your Role In Our Journey

Jane is looking for a Data Analyst who will be responsible for delivering consistent, meaningful insights across the company with a focus on supporting our Product and Marketing teams. You will have strong experience with SQL, dbt, Looker and preferably experience in a fast growing software company. We're looking for someone who thrives in a fast-paced environment, enjoys working with stakeholders to solve business problems, and is excited about working with data that drives business impact. You’ll have the opportunity to shape how Jane uses data to improve product adoption, customer retention, and marketing efficiency. At Jane, we value transparency, ownership, and a problem-solving mindset. If you’re excited about working with data to unlock business insights and help shape decision-making, this could be the perfect role for you.

Learn More About Us

We're founder-led, which means we live our values while maintaining a clear vision for the future. Our product enables the likes of physiotherapists, mental health counsellors, chiropractors, and other allied health practitioners to run their practices in a digital-first way through features such as online booking, charting, scheduling, telehealth, secure payments and billing along with an evolving library of features. You can see more of them here .

We're a company that is growing rapidly, and with that comes the challenge of navigating an environment with many moving parts, often without a clear-cut path laid out in front of us. If you're the kind of person who gets a kick out of being resourceful and loves solving problems, we would love to hear from you.

No doubt, Jane's a special place to work. There is autonomy and flexibility to help integrate work into your life in a way that makes sense for you. Need to block out time to pick up the kids? Go for it. That's normal here. And yes, we have a Slack channel for parents, but we've also got channels dedicated to plants, furry friends, food, pride, wellness - you get the idea! While we love to connect virtually, the Jane team also connects in person throughout the year.

We believe in collaboration, humility, and keeping a growth mindset. We're looking for people who can embrace our way of working, which often means being flexible and open to change. So, if after reading this, you feel excited about the opportunity — all in the name of helping those who help others — reach out to us to learn more.

You can also learn more about Jane as a company and a product by checking out our Glassdoor reviews and our Capterra Reviews

Compensation Expectations For The Role

Jane’s committed to paying our team members fairly, clearly, and above all, paying for growth. This role has a minimum annual salary of $75,200 and maximum annual salary of $112,800. As you may have noticed, this salary range is quite large, and this is intentional to account for the growth someone will experience in the role throughout their time at Jane (i.e., from building the skills, to accomplished, to highly proficient, all the way to achieving excellence in the role). When hiring talented folks to join the Jane team, we’ve found that new team members are best set up for success when hired with the expectation of being fully accomplished in the role, which for this role would reflect a starting salary of $89,300.

It's also possible to join Jane at a salary above or below this, which would mean a salary below $89,300 typically reflects someone who has all the potential to be fully accomplished in the role but doesn't yet possess all the skills required, while a salary above $89,300 is typically for individuals who are currently in this role at Jane and had the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on our customers, product and company with deep Jane knowledge. At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.

Paying clearly is one of our compensation fundamentals to help folks build trust in the compensation process at Jane. To better understand Jane’s compensation fundamentals and how this range is determined, click on this link here for a short video walkthrough of how it all works! We also welcome you to ask as many questions as you’d like about compensation throughout the interview process to ensure you feel confident and build trust through the process.

More information on our benefits can be found here !

At Jane, we’re committed to fostering an environment that allows you to come to work as your truest self. We believe it’s important to actively recognize, embrace, and celebrate our differences in order to make Jane an inclusive, equitable, and diverse workplace.

We want to build a team of people who make conversations rich with perspective and experience. We are committed to listening to every voice in order to learn and grow because doing this will allow us to meet the needs of the diverse community of helpers that Jane serves.

We do not tolerate discrimination, prejudice, or oppressive isms of any kind. Employment is decided on the basis of qualifications, merit, experience, and the needs of the Jane community. We encourage anyone who requires accommodation or adjustments throughout the interview process to let us know, and we will do our best to support you.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists, and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you’ll do

About The Internship Experience

Our internship program provides the opportunity to work on meaningful business initiatives that will grow the GDP of the internet. Through the internship, you will work with many systems and technologies, gain experience in working with large datasets and analytical methodologies/tools to help us better understand our users and build better products.

Each intern has a dedicated mentor, and every intern project is part of the team's roadmap that will directly contribute to Stripe's mission. As you collaborate with industry experts on initiatives that expand global commerce, you will develop a strong first-hand understanding of the role analytics plays in steering business strategy and results.

We're not just focused on your immediate contributions; we're invested in your growth. Stripe sees this internship as an opportunity to grow your technical expertise and facilitate personal development, preparing you for a career in the tech industry.

Responsibilities

You will:


Partner closely with Data Scientists, Data Analysts, and business partners to drive business impact through rigorous analytical solutions
Apply machine learning, causal inference, or advanced analytics on large datasets to: i) measure results and outcomes, ii) identify causal impact and attribution, iii) predict the future performance of users or products, to drive business success
Influence business actions and strategy by developing actionable insights through metrics and dashboards.
Drive the collection of new data and the refinement of existing data sources.
Learn quickly by asking great questions, finding how to work with your mentor and teammates effectively, and communicating the status of your work clearly
Present your work to the Data Science team, partner teams, and fellow interns



Who you are

Minimum Requirements

We’re looking for someone who has:


Enrolled in a quantitative Master's program (e.g. Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, Statistics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2025 or spring/summer 2026
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Experience communicating and collaborating with multidisciplinary stakeholders in a team environment



Preferred Qualifications

You also likely have:


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects
Ability to learn new systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, San Francisco Bay Area, or New York City. We are hiring these positions in Chicago, IL or Toronto, Ontario, Canada.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $135,200 - $135,200. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

You will play a pivotal role in transforming data into actionable insights that drive key business decisions and product strategies. This is a cross-functional role, working closely with Sales, Revenue Operations, Support, Marketing, and other teams to translate data into meaningful narratives, and self-service tools that improve operational efficiency and drive growth.

You’ll help internal teams across the business make decisions using data and visualizations. The ability to think on one’s feet, enjoy collaborating with highly technical teams, and be comfortable working asynchronously is essential.

Key Responsibilities


Advise the go-to-market team with key insights based on data to identify and support opportunities for growth
Analyze sales pipeline, conversion rates, and customer acquisition metrics to identify trends and opportunities.
Develop and automate reporting workflows to improve team efficiency.
Create and maintain documentation of data sources, metrics definitions, and analysis methodologies.
Collaborate with stakeholders to define KPIs and success metrics for GTM initiatives, including product-led growth metrics (user acquisition, activation, retention, etc.) by developing data strategies to provide these insights.
Provide regular insights and recommendations to the leadership team.


What We Are Looking For


Experience at a high growth B2B SaaS company.
Strong understanding of go to market motions, sales metrics, and marketing metrics.
Knowledge of SQL, and widely used tools like Salesforce, Snowflake, and dbt.
Proficiency in data visualization tools (Tableau, Looker, metabase, etc).
Ability to give and process constructive feedback, as well as work independently.
Ability to communicate openly, supporting and championing innovation.
Flexibility to adjust to the dynamic nature of a startup, and adept at dealing with ambiguity.


As a company, we strive to maintain fair compensation practices within our team across all roles and all levels.

What We Offer


An inclusive, flexible environment where you can be your authentic self. We recognize the impact of diverse voices and backgrounds on the growth of our people, product, and company. And that flexibility in how and when you work empowers our team to integrate work and life.
A competitive total compensation package. This includes a base salary, an equity incentive plan and variable commission (for quota-based roles).
Comprehensive group benefits with no waiting period. Take advantage of coverage for health, vision, dental, and more for you and your family!
All-remote with the opportunity to work from anywhere—enjoy a change of scenery wherever you can get wifi, participate in virtual and in-person social events, and leverage our corporate co-working program to visit WeWork (or other similar spaces near you).
Connect with other Tailscalars IRL. Attend our annual company retreat, participate in team/department off-sites, or use your individual travel budget to meet up with team members in Canada, the US, or the UK.
Support for your personal and professional development. Grow your career thoughtfully with $1500 USD annually for professional development, or take advantage of mentorship, coaching, and internal promotion opportunities.
Paid time off and a healthy work-life integration. Our flexible, paid time off program supports you for any situation life throws your way, whether moving homes or travelling the world!
A build-your-own home office setup. You choose your own company-owned laptop (Mac or PC), receive a monthly home internet reimbursement, and $1000 USD to customize your workstation to make it your own.

Als data analist binnen de afdeling Beleidsinformatie vergroot je de data-, analyse- en presentatiedeskundigheid van de afdeling. Je geeft mede richting aan innovatie en je bent verantwoordelijk voor het realiseren van informatieproducten en data-oplossingen.

Vanuit een datagedreven mindset adviseer je en denk je mee over vernieuwende oplossingen en toepassingen voor concrete vragen. Jij begrijpt snel waar het om gaat en ziet onmiddellijk verbanden met andere vragen. Je benadert vraagstukken vanuit een concept en weet ze in context te plaatsen. Zo realiseer je begrijpelijke informatieproducten en data oplossingen op het gebied van de rijksbrede bedrijfsvoering, denk aan: rijkswerkgelegenheid, inkoop, huisvesting en duurzaamheid. Je weet je weg te vinden in R en gebruikt deze tool om verschillende analyses uit te voeren. Van eenvoudige databewerking en koppelingen tot een geavanceerde tekstanalyse, jij draait je hand er niet voor om. Daarnaast gebruiken we bij Beleidsinformatie Shiny dashboards om onze data te visualiseren. Omdat dit een belangrijk onderdeel van je dagelijkse werkzaamheden betreft, verwachten we dat je hier aantoonbare ervaring in hebt.

Naast verstand van de techniek, ga je als data analist bij Beleidsinformatie nog een stap verder. Je bent een luisteraar en doorvrager. Je maakt de vertaalslag tussen beleid en data analyse, en vice versa. Je geeft advies over datavraagstukken en je ontwikkelt nieuwe oplossingen. Je bent een vraagbaak voor je collega's.

De afdeling is volop in ontwikkeling en maakt een grote professionaliseringslag door. Wij bieden een dynamische, uitdagende werkomgeving waarin ruimte is voor innovatie, gezelligheid en professionele ontwikkeling. Je komt te werken in een warm en gedreven team!

Afgeronde WO-studie in een relevante richting.
Een groot analytisch vermogen.
Ervaring met programmeren in R (, eventueel Python) en R Shiny.
Je bent in staat om data duidelijk te presenteren.
Kennis van de laatste ontwikkelingen op het gebied van toepasbare tooling.

So why — despite the huge leaps we've taken in design and usability — does most business phone software still look, feel, and act like it was born in the 90s? OpenPhone is changing that.

We’re a new type of business phone with a mission to help people communicate better and be more productive.

We’re backed by Y Combinator and some of the best venture firms around including Tiger Global, Craft Ventures, Slow Ventures, and others. We take pride in providing an exceptional customer experience and a product people love, which is why we’re excited that our customers have rated us the #1 VoIP Provider on G2.

OpenPhone is the modern, sophisticated answer to the clunky, outdated phone systems that have been slowing down businesses for years. With thousands of happy customers and several rounds of funding in just five years, it's safe to say we're onto something big.

About The Role

We are hiring a Data Analyst with 4+ years of experience to primarily support our Go-To-Market (GTM) teams by providing insights and reporting to drive strategic decision-making. The ideal candidate will have strong analytical skills, experience with SQL, BI reporting tools, and a passion for translating data into actionable business insights. Experience in SaaS environments and familiarity with key SaaS metrics is highly desirable.

Some Of The Things You’ll Do


Develop and maintain dashboards and reports using BI tools (e.g., Mode, Tableau) to support GTM teams.
Analyze marketing, advertising, and sales data, including conversion funnel and cohort retention analyses, slicing data by attribution models, and providing customer lifecycle insights.
Collaborate with stakeholders across sales, marketing, and customer success to define key metrics and reporting needs.
Write efficient SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data from various sources.
Assist in data modeling and transformation using dbt (a plus but not required).
Comfortable with working large and complex data coming from multiple sources such as Kafka events or web traffic data from ad platforms.
Communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Ensure data accuracy, integrity, and security in all reporting and analysis efforts.


About You


4+ years of experience in data analysis, preferably in a SaaS environment.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills with a quantitative mindset.
Familiarity with analytics engineering and dbt (a plus).
Excellent communication skills with the ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical audiences.
Ability to thrive in a high-paced, high-growth environment.
Experience managing data projects and collaborating with cross-functional teams.


Compensation

The annual base salary range for this position is as follows, plus equity and benefits:


SF Bay Area, Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Boston, New York, and Washington, DC Metro: $158,000 - $176,000 USD
All other US Locations: $141,000 - $156,000 USD
Canada: 160,000 - $178,000 CAD


The ranges displayed reflect the target for new hire salaries, and within each range, individual pay is determined by your skills and experience, as well as relevant education. Your recruiter can share more and answer questions about the specific salary range during the hiring process.

Salary is just one component of OpenPhone’s total compensation package. Your total rewards package will include equity, extensive medical coverage, a monthly lifestyle stipend, and a flexible PTO policy.

Who We Are

As a fully remote company, we thrive asynchronously as a team. We are curious, ambitious, and dedicated to our work. We value trust above all else, and have a strong bias for action. If you're looking for a place to do your life's work, please get in touch. We'd love to hear from you.

And remember, there's no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. We're looking for optimists with grit and determination, who are excited to face the challenges of a growing startup. OpenPhone is the type of company where you can grow, and we encourage you to apply for this role even if you don't think you meet all the requirements.

We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment. It is important that you are able to bring your authentic self to work every day. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists, and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you’ll do

About The Internship Experience

Our internship program provides the opportunity to work on meaningful business initiatives that will grow the GDP of the internet. Through the internship, you will work with many systems and technologies, gain experience in working with large datasets and analytical methodologies/tools to help us better understand our users and build better products.

Each intern has a dedicated mentor, and every intern project is part of the team's roadmap that will directly contribute to Stripe's mission. As you collaborate with industry experts on initiatives that expand global commerce, you will develop a strong first-hand understanding of the role analytics plays in steering business strategy and results.

We're not just focused on your immediate contributions; we're invested in your growth. Stripe sees this internship as an opportunity to grow your technical expertise and facilitate personal development, preparing you for a career in the tech industry.

Responsibilities

You will:


Partner closely with Data Scientists, Data Analysts, and business partners to drive business impact through rigorous analytical solutions
Apply machine learning, causal inference, or advanced analytics on large datasets to: i) measure results and outcomes, ii) identify causal impact and attribution, iii) predict the future performance of users or products, to drive business success
Influence business actions and strategy by developing actionable insights through metrics and dashboards.
Drive the collection of new data and the refinement of existing data sources.
Learn quickly by asking great questions, finding how to work with your mentor and teammates effectively, and communicating the status of your work clearly

Who you are

Minimum Requirements

Enrolled in a quantitative Master's program (e.g. Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, Statistics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2025 or spring/summer 2026
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Experience communicating and collaborating with multidisciplinary stakeholders in a team environment



Preferred Qualifications

You also likely have:


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $135,200 - $135,200. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location.

We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

The Senior Analyst, Data and Analytics, reports to the Manager of Data and Analytics in the Quality division of the Clinical Institutes and Quality Programs portfolio. The Senior Analyst will support the development of primary data analysis and reporting content for emerging provincial quality issues, high-priority initiatives, and quality programs (e.g., Clinical and Quality Standards, Quality Improvement Plans, the Ontario Surgical Quality Improvement Network, the Emergency Department Return Visit Quality Program). In doing so, they will use Ontario’s health administrative databases and concise evidence-based guidance with associated quality indicators developed by Ontario Health.

They will identify and leverage the findings of relevant existing published research and combine these with their own primary data analysis to develop analytical plans and reporting products.

The Senior Analyst will support the development of analytical methodology using health administrative and clinical data sources, create internal and external information products, and derive actionable insights to support quality improvement and performance management. They will work in cross-functional teams with stakeholders with varying degrees of technical knowledge to identify analysis requirements, inform indicator development, and prepare and analyze data to support other initiatives within the Quality division. In collaboration with the Lead and Manager of Data Analytics, they may also be responsible for communicating information to program areas across Ontario Health, as well as to external stakeholders, subject matter experts, and organizations.

To do this, we start with our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization.

Data is at the heart of Lyft’s products and decision-making. You will leverage data and rigorous, analytical thinking to shape our products and make business decisions. This will involve performing rigorous product deep dives, identifying opportunities for product enhancements, and measuring the impact of new features.

The Verticals team encompasses 3 critical and unique products / marketplaces within Lyft: airports, scheduled rides, and events. Airports are one of the most important, impactful, and complex parts of Lyft’s Rideshare business, as they are a key part of both the rider and driver Lyft experience and have unique dynamics. Scheduled rides allow riders to book a ride in advance with high reliability, and enable drivers to add structure to their work schedule. Lastly, events such as concerts or sporting games require similar considerations of special operations to ensure a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.

As a Senior Data Analyst on the Verticals team, you will collaborate with engineering, product, design, operations, and marketing to think critically about the current rider and driver experience and implement product enhancements to facilitate market growth. The ideal candidate can apply strong business acumen to propose product and marketplace changes, and is comfortable working with a highly cross functional team. In this role, you will help us tackle problems such as:


Which airports are underperforming and which key metrics can we use to identify and classify airport performance? What targets should we set for these key metrics?
What is driving high cancellation rates today and which types of riders/drivers are cancelling? What product changes can we implement to reduce cancellation rates for scheduled rides?
How are riders and drivers using different ride modes at airports and events, and how do we design products to address this behavior?
How are riders and drivers discovering scheduled rides and are there entry point optimizations we can implement?


Responsibilities:


Leverage data and analytic frameworks to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency across Verticals products, recommending solutions to drive business impact
Understand the complex business dynamics across the Verticals product areas, specifically how these products differ from traditional rideshare marketplaces, to propose enhancements that compliment Lyft-wide products
Partner with product managers, engineers, marketers, designers, and operators to translate data insights into decisions and action
Develop dashboards and analytical frameworks to monitor business and product performance
Establish metrics that measure the health of our products, the business, as well as the rider and driver experiences


Experience:


5-7+ years of experience in data analytics in a high-growth environment
Degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, economics, applied math, operations research or engineering (an asset, advanced degrees also an asset)
End-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, analysis, and visualization
Ability to manage, influence, negotiate, and inspire others in a fast-moving environment
Proficient in SQL and quantitative analysis, you can deep dive into large amounts of data, draw meaningful insights, dissect business issues and draw actionable conclusions
Outcome-driven approach to developing recommendations and demonstrated ability to develop a story and execution plan to support goals and objectives
Exceptional communication (listening, written, and oral) skills with the ability to present findings and recommendations targeted to the audience in question.
A drive to understand the core issues along with the determination to uncover the solution
Thrives within ambiguity and context-switching
Strong oral and written communication skills, and ability to collaborate with cross-functional partners


Benefits:


Extended health and dental coverage options, along with life insurance and disability benefits
Mental health benefits
Family building benefits
Child care and pet benefits
Access to a Lyft funded Health Care Savings Account
RRSP plan to help save for your future
In addition to provincial observed holidays, salaried team members are covered under Lyft's flexible paid time off policy. The policy allows team members to take off as much time as they need (with manager approval). Hourly team members get 15 days paid time off, with an additional day for each year of service
Lyft is proud to support new parents with 18 weeks of paid time off, designed as a top-up plan to complement provincial programs. Biological, adoptive, and foster parents are all eligible.
Subsidized commuter benefits

When it comes to your career, we want to provide big opportunities to help you make a big impact. But for this to be possible, we strive to feel small. Small enough to quickly change tack, small enough to learn from different teams and small enough to connect authentically with leadership.

Plenty of flexible leave options and employee benefits including up to 31 days of paid time off in your first year, continuing education with access to LinkedIn Learning, a full benefits package including medical, dental & vision, 401K with company match, and wellness program.




What You’ll Do




We’re looking for a Senior Data Analyst to join our team and drive insights that enhance our customers’ understanding of user behavior and the path to purchase. This individual will play a key role in analyzing marketplace data across multiple websites to inform data-driven media planning & marketing decisions for our partners.




Analyze user behavior to identify interests, predict actions, and map the path to purchase for RVs, motorcycles, boats, and commercial equipment
Develop and maintain dashboards and reports using tools like Tableau and Power BI to enable self-serve insights for sales teams
Work on sales attribution by combining cross-category sales data with on-site user shopping behavior to support the value of our partnerships
Leverage multiple data sources to create innovative visualizations that better depict user engagement and the customer journey
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to design the next generation of insights and analysis frameworks
Provide actionable recommendations to improve customer engagement and product performance throughout the purchase journey




What We’re Looking For




4+ years of experience in data analysis, ideally within the media or digital space
Proficiency in tools like Tableau, Power BI, and SQL
Strong analytical skills with experience in user behavior analysis and predictive modeling
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to present complex data in an easily understandable manner
Experience working with diverse data sets and creating compelling visualizations




Bonus Points:




Bachelor’s degree in Data Science, Analytics, Statistics, or a related field (or equivalent experience)
Basic coding skills in Python, R, or a similar language to support data preparation and advanced analysis




So come and join our team - because every role is a big role in our plans to go big.

Chainlink Labs is the primary contributing developer of Chainlink, the decentralized computing platform powering the verifiable web. Chainlink is the industry-standard platform for providing access to real-world data, offchain computation, and secure cross-chain interoperability across any blockchain. Chainlink Labs helps power verifiable applications for banking, DeFi, global trade, and gaming by collaborating with some of the world’s largest financial institutions, notably Swift, DTCC, and ANZ. Chainlink Labs also works with top Web3 teams, including Aave, Compound, GMX, Maker, and Synthetix. Chainlink Labs was ranked in Newsweek’s 100 Most Loved Workplaces 2023 in both the United States and United Kingdom.

Chainlink Labs is pioneering the world’s first fully sustainable and decentralized oracle network, and the Economics team is searching for a Senior Analyst to play a critical role in building it. This role will sit at the intersection of blockchain technology, financial innovation, and economic systems, and shape the future of decentralized economics.

As a Senior Analyst, you will combine economics, data science, and blockchain expertise to shape incentives, optimize network design, and influence the decision-making of our Economics and Executive Leadership teams. You will design, analyze, and operationalize economic models for production applications. You will collaborate across departments to bring innovative solutions from concept to production, ensuring economic soundness and scalability throughout.

You'll work on a wide array of blockchain economics projects, analyses, and systems, including:
Designing novel mechanisms and incentive schemes
Building models and simulations to evaluate investment opportunities
Designing and parameterizing trading systems
Optimizing parameters for production applications
Contributing to the design of Economics programs and applications
You'll optimize network incentives and systems by engaging directly with the Economics, Product, Engineering, Research, and Data Science teams to understand network dynamics at the deepest level.
You'll operationalize processes and analytics systems, and coordinate cross-functionally to implement them.
This is both a highly technical and highly social role. You will have high visibility and a large impact on how Chainlink builds the world’s first fully sustainable decentralized oracle network.

Requirements


5+ years experience in a quantitative role, particularly trading or quant research
A deep understanding of financial and crypto markets and incentives
Extensive financial modeling background, including data engineering and model automation
Strong SQL and Python skills are mandatory
Experience solving economic problems through statistical/econometric analyses
Substantial data analysis and/or data science experience
Meticulous attention to detail.


Preferred Qualifications


Strong Economics and/or Finance background through Masters-level academics and/or multiple years of industry experience.
