About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Payment Intelligence Engineering’s purpose is to mitigate threats to our systems in order to keep our merchants, Stripe and financial partners safe. We empower global businesses with intelligent solutions for conversion and fraud prevention, leveraging consumer intelligence and transparent ML to maximize growth and build trust. Our Payments Intelligence portfolio delivers actionable insights to all user segments.

The Payments Health Technical Operations team is pioneering new ways to achieve this mission. Our dynamic team relies on the expertise of integration reliability engineers and data analysts to identify gaps and build comprehensive solutions in the ever changing arena of fraud prevention.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and maintain SQL queries to analyze and navigate complex financial data effectively.
Enhance overall observability by identifying gaps and proposing actionable insights to improve our monitoring systems.
Actively hunt for patterns and anomalies in data that could indicate potential threats or operational issues.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to consolidate and gather relevant data for informed engineering efforts.
Design and implement comprehensive dashboards for real-time visibility into key metrics and system health.
Establish and refine key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress and improvements over time.
Support the creation and maintenance of observability frameworks to ensure early detection of issues.
Contribute to efforts that reduce organizational toil by optimizing data analysis processes.
Communicate findings and insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Stay updated with industry trends in data analysis and financial data handling to ensure best practices.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have 5+ years of experience in Payments at a leading technology or payments company
Have experience writing SQL to query relational databases
Have experience managing communications and workflows with technical and non-technical teams across internal and external stakeholders
Experience mentoring junior team members in technical skill development, operational strategy and problem solving
Have experience navigating the nuanced complexity of financial systems and solving large scale, technical challenges
Have strong financial modeling and analytical skills to investigate, prioritize, and identify the root cause of issues
Have experience managing multiple, concurrent work streams, identifying and triaging technical issues and driving solutions with clear metrics to show impact



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,400 - $219,600. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Job Summary

The Research Data Analyst functions as a statistical analyst for the UCSF Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy, and Sleep Medicine supporting divisional principal investigators. The Research Data Analyst will primarily be responsible for developing and conducting complex statistical analyses and providing database development and management.

The Research Data Analyst is specifically tailored to work on exposure-related lung diseases. The lung is constantly exposed to various environmental pollutants, allergens, and toxins, which interact with airways and alveoli and result in inflammation, injury, and disease. The specific laboratory that houses this position is focused on the paradigm that respiratory exposures to pollutants and toxicants contribute to development and progression of chronic lung diseases, and may further yield systemic effects well beyond lungs. Under this paradigm, the research activities have focused on understanding the physiologic and immunologic mechanisms via which environmental exposures contribute to chronic lung diseases and how knowledge of these mechanisms could be translated to ways to better define, prognosticate, and manage disease burden at both individual and societal levels.

The Research Data Analyst will use skills as an experienced research professional with an in-depth understanding of biostatistics and research software programming techniques to oversee and conduct the statistical component of new and ongoing protocols. The analyst will work closely with research team members (e.g., principal investigators, research managers, trainees, CRCs, etc.) to support the conduct of the research. The individual will help manage, analyze, interpret, and report on statistical findings. Specifically, the individual will conduct complex statistical analyses and prepare findings for presentation at professional meeting and publication in medical journals.


NOTE: This is a part-time (50%) Contract role for 1 year.


The final salary and offer components are subject to additional approvals based on UC policy.

Your placement within the salary range is dependent on a number of factors including your work experience and internal equity within this position classification at UCSF. For positions that are represented by a labor union, placement within the salary range will be guided by the rules in the collective bargaining agreement.

The salary range for this position is $87,900 - $126,900 (Annual Rate).

Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities. In fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.

Our vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we're creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality. Homeward supports Medicare-eligible beneficiaries by partnering with health plans, providers, and communities to align incentives – taking full financial accountability for clinical outcomes and the total cost of care across rural counties.

As a public benefit corporation and Certified B Corp™, Homeward's mission and business model are aligned to address the healthcare, economic, and demographic challenges that make it challenging for rural Americans to stay healthy. Our Homeward Navigation™ platform uses advanced analytics to connect members to the right care and local resources that address social determinants of health and improve holistic health outcomes. Since many rural communities lack adequate clinical capacity, Homeward also employs care teams that supplement local practices and reach people who cannot otherwise access care.

Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo's products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding. With this leadership team and funding, Homeward is committed to bringing high-quality healthcare to rural communities in need.

Collaborative spirit and ability to drive analyses with technical and non-technical stakeholders
Ability to zoom in with attention to detail and also zoom out to see the big picture
Strong communicator of questions, challenges, opportunities, and results to technical and non-technical audiences

Compassion and empathy
Curiosity, and an eagerness to listen
Drive to deliver high-quality experiences, clinical care, and cost-effectiveness
Strong focus on sustainability of our business and scalability of our services, to maximize our reach and impact

Benefits:


Competitive salary, equity grant, generous paid time off

Hi there, we're Yendo, and our vision is to empower everyday people to build a stronger financial future. In less than 2 years, we’ve saved customers over $100 million in unnecessary interest and fees.

We are using AI to unlock the $1.1 Trillion in vehicle equity trapped within cars owned by Americans in the form of a high limit, standard rate credit card for those traditionally excluded from mainstream financial offerings.

Yendo Credit Cards have similar APRs to those issued for prime borrowers with no hidden fees or overdraft charges and help build their customers' credit score. Yendo's credit limits are 4x higher than cards typically available for non-prime borrowers.




Role Overview

The Data Analyst is a key contributor in advancing the products offerings of the company and developing models that create valuable insights used to advance product development, improve operational processes, and more. In this role, your mandate is to synthesize large amounts of data across a variety of verticals (financial, acquisition, customer behavior, etc.) to drive actionable insights for a wide range of teams. We are working day-in and day-out to defeat predatory lending and unlock affordable finances for 100 million people. No task is too small for anyone within Yendo. This is a fast-paced and fun environment.




Responsibilities

You will work on a number of data analysis projects across the company to synthesize large amounts of data and create insights for key stakeholders and departments
You will anticipate the analytical needs of the company and produce reports and dashboards, which enable timely and relevant decision making
You're a thought leader to the business, owning end-to-end analytic work streams







What you’ll need

5+ years of hands-on analytics experience with product, finance, or growth teams, ideally at a software company
Background in data-informed decision-making and partnering with multi-functional teams.
Proficient in SQL, Excel, and visualization tools such as Metabase or Tableau
Experience with a statistical programming language like R or Python
You are competitive and want to win
Self-starter attitude and ability to work independently
Passionate about financial inclusion and mobility
Demonstrated ability to partner effectively across the organization
Must have a positive attitude and willingness to roll-up their sleeves and get things done
Strong interpersonal skills and the ability to cultivate relationships with senior leadership







Why join us

🤝You can make a real impact to the lives of our customers.

💳 100 million Americans lack access to sustainable credit and are forced to use predatory loans. Think 500%+ APR alternative financing options such as Auto Title, Payday, Pawn, and Personal Loans.
