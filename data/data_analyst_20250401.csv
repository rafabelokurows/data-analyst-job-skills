About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of more than 240 employees from over 40 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

Getreu unserem Motto – People is what makes us us – sind uns deine nachhaltige Ausbildung und Weiterentwicklung, deine ausgeglichene Work-Life-Balance und deine Happiness sehr wichtig. Konkret stellen wir mit 32 Urlaubstagen, 60 % mobilem Arbeiten, bis zu 4 Wochen pro Jahr – im europäischen Ausland – der Möglichkeit remote zu arbeiten, Sabbatical und Überstundenausgleich sicher, dass dir im FUSE-Agentur-Leben nichts fehlt.

In unserem derzeit über 60-köpfigen Team sowie unseren Kund*innen haben wir unser perfektes Match bereits gefunden. Wenn du noch auf der Suche bist, bei „popkulturellem Relevanzmarketing“ neugierig wirst und für Social Media, Influencer Marketing oder Gaming & Esports brennst, dann lass uns zusammen loslegen! Denn : Action Creates Impact .

Dein Job

Als (Junior) Insights Analyst (mensch) bearbeitest du als Teil unseres Data und Analytics Teams in erster Linie die Anfragen unserer Kunden nach Social Media Reportings sowie Social Listening Analysen und beherrschst den Spagat zwischen analytischem und kreativem Denken, um die Kolleg:Innen in deinem und anderen Teams mit datenbasierten Insights zu Kundenmeinungen, Märkten, Zielgruppen, Marken und ihren Social Media-Umfeldern zu versorgen.

Dein Aufgabenbereich

Datenbeschaffung / Toolbedienung

Du bist präzise, schnell, zuverlässig und motiviert, wenn es um die manuelle Erfassung großer (Social Media)- Datenmengen geht, aber auch wissbegierig und begeisterungsfähig, dich diesbezüglich kontinuierlich mit Prozessoptimierung zu befassen, sowie dich in Tools und automatisierte Datenerfassungsprozesse und Methoden einzudenken, um immer bessere Lösungen zu finden.

Datenstrukturierung, Effiziente Datensammlung, Query Writing, Kategorisierung und Datendarstellung werden hier deine täglichen Begleiter.

Studiendurchführung

Von der (manchmal noch recht schwammigen) Fragestellung bis zum fertigen Analysebericht mit guten Insights und Handlungsempfehlungen ist es oft ein weiter aber spannender Weg. Der kann bald auch deiner sein, gemeinsam mit uns im Team.

Du hast ein sehr gutes Gespür für Sprache und Kommunikation? Nice, das brauchst du hier in mindestens dreierlei Hinsicht: Erstens, um aus den Aussagen und Briefings unserer Auftraggeber herausfiltern zu können, wie du ihnen am besten weiterhelfen kannst. Zweitens, wenn es darum geht, die Essenz von Konsumenten-Posts und Kommentaren auf Social Media zu verstehen, schließlich ist Inhaltanalyse unser Daily-Business. Und Drittens, um dann Deine Findings Zielgruppengerecht rüberzubringen - in Reports, in Meetings und bei Präsentationen.

Datenanalyse

Auswertungslogiken passend zu den gegebenen Fragestellungen und Erkenntnisinteressen erstellen, Dimensionierungen & Kategorisierungen für Inhaltsanalysen planen und entwickeln, Daten auszählen, filtern, darstellen, vergleichen, interpretieren, daraus kreative Idee und Empfehlungen ableiten. Das ist dein Playground. Deine Affinität zu Zahlen und Daten kannst du hier immer wieder beweisen. Ein stets strukturiertes Vorgehen und ein souveräner Umgang auch mit großen und komplexen Datenmengen, Statistiken und Zahlen sind für dich selbstverständlich.

Spezielle Social Media Analyse-Tools wirst Du ebenso (kennenlernen und) zum Einsatz bringen wie ganz viel Excel und das gute alte Powerpoint.

Das bringst du mit

Du kannst (erste) Erfahrung in der qualitativen und quantitativen Forschungsarbeit, sowie in der marketing- oder kundenorientierten Projektarbeit vorweisen und hast Lust dich im Bereich Social Media Analytics weiter auszutoben. Du hast, dank deines Studiums, einen kommunikations-, sozial- oder medienwissenschaftlichen Background und bringst Kenntnisse der Methoden im Bereich der quantitativen und qualitativen Marktforschung mit. Du hast neben den analytischen Fähigkeiten, auch ein Gespür für gute kreative Kommunikation und Lust, diese mitzuentwickeln. Du bist organisiert und selbständig, willst aber auch noch ständig ganz viel lernen und verstehst dich als Teamplayer, der immer auf Höhe des Zeitgeists ist und daraus neue Impulse für unsere Teams und Kunden ableitet.

At our headquarters in the heart of Berlin, 90+ passionate team members collaborate across functions to shape the future of visual content. With 25 years of success behind us, we are now evolving rapidly to meet the demands of a data-driven, digital-first future.




We're looking for a Data Engineer (f/m/d) to join our growing Data & BI team. In this role, you'll work on the backbone of our data infrastructure - ensuring reliable data pipelines while also helping modernize and scale our platform for the future.

You'll work closely with stakeholders across the organization to understand their needs, translate them into scalable data solutions, and help shape the way data is used across IMAGO.


Tasks



Design, build, and maintain scalable ETL pipelines using Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and SQL


Contribute to ongoing efforts to modernize our data stack, including evaluating and introducing modern tools (e.g. Python-based ETL, dbt, orchestration frameworks, cloud DWH solutions)


Monitor and troubleshoot daily enterprise data workflows to ensure timely and accurate data delivery


Optimize and evolve our existing data warehouse infrastructure to support analytical and operational use cases


Conduct stakeholder interviews, understand data requirements and turn them into actionable reports and dashboards in Tableau


Develop and manage data source connections, refresh schedules, and job monitoring for Tableau dashboards


Implement and support data quality checks, performance tuning, and structured documentation



Requirements



3+ years of experience in a data engineering or similar role, ideally in an analytics or business-focused environment


Proficient in SQL and hands-on experience with Microsoft SQL Server and SSIS


Solid understanding of data modeling, ETL design principles, and data warehouse architecture


Experience with Tableau (or similar BI tools), including dashboard data preparation and source management


Familiarity with scripting languages such as Python or PowerShell for automation and pipeline support


Interest in or exposure to modern data tools (e.g. dbt, Airflow, Snowflake, BigQuery, or similar)


Ability to work independently and take ownership of projects while collaborating with technical and non-technical teams


Strong communication and interpersonal skills - you enjoy collaborating with stakeholders across departments





Nice to have:





Experience with NoSQL databases or Big Data technologies (e.g. Hadoop, Spark, Hive)


Familiarity with Infrastructure as Code tools (e.g. Terraform, Ansible)


German is a plus but not required



Benefits



Permanent employment contract


A company pension scheme


A modern workplace in the heart of Berlin


Ticket for public transportation (e.g. Germany ticket)


Platform for employee discounts from a wide range of providers


Additional English or German courses if needed





Looking forward to your application.

Our small Canadian-born business was founded in 1978 and has become a global organization that now spans 120 locations across 20 countries. Our expansion has been rapid, but what matters most is the common belief that drives all 5,000 of our people to be a different type of real estate organization. We believe that the places in which we live, work and play have the power to make us happier and healthier, and we are united by a shared sense of purpose, to have a positive impact on people’s lives. In short, we are a global commercial real estate advisory firm with a simple aim: for real estate to play a leading role in creating vibrant buildings, cities and places that deliver long-lasting social value and economic impact.

Why Work For Us

We believe that our industry is changing, and we want our business to be a melting pot of curious minds, passionate hearts and strategic intelligence. Your gender, religion and race are all highly respected, but are less important to us than your ability to step up and change the game. We provide you with a place where you can do just that, with like-minded people. Collaboration is embedded in the way we work – our people have the autonomy to collaborate on client relationships, engage teams across the business, lead operations, work collectively on projects, participate in strategy and are ultimately responsible for our growth. Our distinctive Principal-led, privately-owned model puts us in the enviable position of being able to offer every employee the opportunity to own a share of our business and inspires and allows anyone to become a Principal. This role carries voting rights, so our people have a very real say in the future direction and operation of our business.

This is a hybrid contract role offering £400 - £500 per day (Inside IR35), for an initial 3-6 months, with the opportunity to play a pivotal role in system integration and data transformation at a business-critical moment.

The Company
This PE-backed telecoms business has rapidly scaled to become a major player in the UK fibre broadband space. With a strong presence in London and ambitious expansion plans underway, the company is investing heavily in its systems, data architecture, and finance capabilities to support sustained growth. As they embark on a significant system and customer migration programme, the business is seeking a commercially-minded Interim Data Analyst to support this evolution and drive insight-led decision-making across the business.

The Role
As Interim Data Analyst, you'll sit at the centre of a fast-moving transformation programme, supporting system integration, customer migration, and enhanced reporting across the business. This is a hands-on, commercially focused role requiring both technical expertise and the ability to communicate insight with clarity.

Key responsibilities include:

Acting as a bridge between finance, IT, and operations - aligning data sets, uncovering insights, and driving informed decision-making.
Building scalable, flexible data models to support evolving business needs during systems change.
Designing automated dashboards and reporting tools to empower business leaders with real-time, actionable information.
Identifying and resolving data quality issues at source, embedding governance improvements in the process.
Analysing performance across key drivers - including revenue, cost, and customer behaviour - and delivering clear, concise recommendations.
Supporting senior stakeholders with data-led input across a range of strategic and operational initiatives.
Championing best practices in reporting, data visualisation, and cross-team collaboration.

Your Profile
You'll likely bring:

Strong SQL skills and hands-on experience building reporting tools in a fast-paced, change-driven environment.
A commercial lens - you understand how data influences strategy, finance, and operational decision-making.
Experience working across teams - whether it's finance, tech, or operations - with the ability to communicate clearly and credibly at all levels.
A proactive mindset and the confidence to take ownership, drive clarity and challenge assumptions when needed.
Exposure to telecoms, infrastructure, or other data-rich sectors undergoing change would be helpful, but not essential.
Immediate or short notice availability, with the flexibility to pick things up quickly and deliver at pace.

The day rate of £400 - £500 per day should represent a fair value or a logical uplift on your previous compensation.

Compensation & Benefits
As well as the day rate of £400-500, this Interim Data Analyst role offers the opportunity to directly shape the data environment of a high-growth telecoms business. You'll work closely with a forward-thinking and commercially astute finance team, helping to build long-term data infrastructure while delivering short-term insights that influence strategic decisions.

The company's City office is well connected, and the team embraces a flexible hybrid working model (typically 2-3 days in-office per week), reflecting a modern and pragmatic culture.

This is a hybrid contract role offering £400 - £500 per day (Inside IR35), for an initial 3-6 months, with the opportunity to play a pivotal role in system integration and data transformation at a business-critical moment.

The Company
This PE-backed telecoms business has rapidly scaled to become a major player in the UK fibre broadband space. With a strong presence in London and ambitious expansion plans underway, the company is investing heavily in its systems, data architecture, and finance capabilities to support sustained growth. As they embark on a significant system and customer migration programme, the business is seeking a commercially-minded Interim Data Analyst to support this evolution and drive insight-led decision-making across the business.

The Role
As Interim Data Analyst, you'll sit at the centre of a fast-moving transformation programme, supporting system integration, customer migration, and enhanced reporting across the business. This is a hands-on, commercially focused role requiring both technical expertise and the ability to communicate insight with clarity.

Key responsibilities include:

Acting as a bridge between finance, IT, and operations - aligning data sets, uncovering insights, and driving informed decision-making.
Building scalable, flexible data models to support evolving business needs during systems change.
Designing automated dashboards and reporting tools to empower business leaders with real-time, actionable information.
Identifying and resolving data quality issues at source, embedding governance improvements in the process.
Analysing performance across key drivers - including revenue, cost, and customer behaviour - and delivering clear, concise recommendations.
Supporting senior stakeholders with data-led input across a range of strategic and operational initiatives.
Championing best practices in reporting, data visualisation, and cross-team collaboration.

Your Profile
You'll likely bring:

Strong SQL skills and hands-on experience building reporting tools in a fast-paced, change-driven environment.
A commercial lens - you understand how data influences strategy, finance, and operational decision-making.
Experience working across teams - whether it's finance, tech, or operations - with the ability to communicate clearly and credibly at all levels.
A proactive mindset and the confidence to take ownership, drive clarity and challenge assumptions when needed.
Exposure to telecoms, infrastructure, or other data-rich sectors undergoing change would be helpful, but not essential.
Immediate or short notice availability, with the flexibility to pick things up quickly and deliver at pace.

The day rate of £400 - £500 per day should represent a fair value or a logical uplift on your previous compensation.

Compensation & Benefits
As well as the day rate of £400-500, this Interim Data Analyst role offers the opportunity to directly shape the data environment of a high-growth telecoms business. You'll work closely with a forward-thinking and commercially astute finance team, helping to build long-term data infrastructure while delivering short-term insights that influence strategic decisions.

The company's City office is well connected, and the team embraces a flexible hybrid working model (typically 2-3 days in-office per week), reflecting a modern and pragmatic culture.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Let’s kick things off with a quick intro. Jane is a team that’s all about fostering growth, spreading delight, and serving our healthcare community. We’re looking for people who are ready to jump in and join us as we simplify the lives of healthcare practitioners and patients every day.

At Jane, success means collaborating with your team, delivering an aligned result with efficiency and quality, communicating clearly and openly, and embracing continuous improvement. And guess what? Jane is a remote-first company, so every role, including this one, gives you the freedom to work from anywhere in Canada.

Your Role In Our Journey

Jane is looking for a Data Analyst who will be responsible for delivering consistent, meaningful insights across the company with a focus on supporting our Product and Marketing teams. You will have strong experience with SQL, dbt, Looker and preferably experience in a fast growing software company. We're looking for someone who thrives in a fast-paced environment, enjoys working with stakeholders to solve business problems, and is excited about working with data that drives business impact. You’ll have the opportunity to shape how Jane uses data to improve product adoption, customer retention, and marketing efficiency. At Jane, we value transparency, ownership, and a problem-solving mindset. If you’re excited about working with data to unlock business insights and help shape decision-making, this could be the perfect role for you.

Learn More About Us

We're founder-led, which means we live our values while maintaining a clear vision for the future. Our product enables the likes of physiotherapists, mental health counsellors, chiropractors, and other allied health practitioners to run their practices in a digital-first way through features such as online booking, charting, scheduling, telehealth, secure payments and billing along with an evolving library of features. You can see more of them here .

We're a company that is growing rapidly, and with that comes the challenge of navigating an environment with many moving parts, often without a clear-cut path laid out in front of us. If you're the kind of person who gets a kick out of being resourceful and loves solving problems, we would love to hear from you.

No doubt, Jane's a special place to work. There is autonomy and flexibility to help integrate work into your life in a way that makes sense for you. Need to block out time to pick up the kids? Go for it. That's normal here. And yes, we have a Slack channel for parents, but we've also got channels dedicated to plants, furry friends, food, pride, wellness - you get the idea! While we love to connect virtually, the Jane team also connects in person throughout the year.

We believe in collaboration, humility, and keeping a growth mindset. We're looking for people who can embrace our way of working, which often means being flexible and open to change. So, if after reading this, you feel excited about the opportunity — all in the name of helping those who help others — reach out to us to learn more.

You can also learn more about Jane as a company and a product by checking out our Glassdoor reviews and our Capterra Reviews

If you're excited by our growth, ready to contribute to a challenging yet rewarding environment, and eager to be a disruptor alongside a team of talented individuals, we’d love to hear from you!

The impact you could have


Collaborate with Product and Marketing teams to create and improve existing metrics, models, and documentation across multiple subject areas.
Own analysis from concept to implementation, build Looker reports and dashboards and share results with relevant stakeholders.
Develop and optimize Looker dashboards to surface insights and track business performance.
Help build and refine data models using DBT and Snowflake.
Build and maintain data pipelines to drive decision-making.
Work with ambiguous or incomplete requirements — identify gaps, ask the right questions, and deliver valuable insights.


The Experience We Feel We Need


3+ years experience as a data analyst in a high growth environment
Strong experience with SQL, DBT, and Looker — able to write complex queries, model data effectively, and create insightful dashboards.
Excellent communication skills and the ability to explain technical insights to non-technical audiences.
Experience working with product or marketing teams to define business requirements and drive insights.
Ability to take initiative and ownership, comfortable working independently and seeing projects through to completion.
Strong analytical skills with attention to detail and accuracy.
Experience with Github/version control.


Bonus Points

Experience with event tracking data like RudderStack.
Experience with SQL query optimization and performance tuning
Familiarity with different data architectures (e.g., star vs snowflake schema)


Compensation Expectations For The Role

Jane’s committed to paying our team members fairly, clearly, and above all, paying for growth. This role has a minimum annual salary of $75,200 and maximum annual salary of $112,800. As you may have noticed, this salary range is quite large, and this is intentional to account for the growth someone will experience in the role throughout their time at Jane (i.e., from building the skills, to accomplished, to highly proficient, all the way to achieving excellence in the role). When hiring talented folks to join the Jane team, we’ve found that new team members are best set up for success when hired with the expectation of being fully accomplished in the role, which for this role would reflect a starting salary of $89,300.

It's also possible to join Jane at a salary above or below this, which would mean a salary below $89,300 typically reflects someone who has all the potential to be fully accomplished in the role but doesn't yet possess all the skills required, while a salary above $89,300 is typically for individuals who are currently in this role at Jane and had the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on our customers, product and company with deep Jane knowledge. At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.

Paying clearly is one of our compensation fundamentals to help folks build trust in the compensation process at Jane. To better understand Jane’s compensation fundamentals and how this range is determined, click on this link here for a short video walkthrough of how it all works! We also welcome you to ask as many questions as you’d like about compensation throughout the interview process to ensure you feel confident and build trust through the process.

More information on our benefits can be found here !

At Jane, we’re committed to fostering an environment that allows you to come to work as your truest self. We believe it’s important to actively recognize, embrace, and celebrate our differences in order to make Jane an inclusive, equitable, and diverse workplace.

We want to build a team of people who make conversations rich with perspective and experience. We are committed to listening to every voice in order to learn and grow because doing this will allow us to meet the needs of the diverse community of helpers that Jane serves.

We do not tolerate discrimination, prejudice, or oppressive isms of any kind. Employment is decided on the basis of qualifications, merit, experience, and the needs of the Jane community. We encourage anyone who requires accommodation or adjustments throughout the interview process to let us know, and we will do our best to support you.

You can see more of them here .<br><br>We're a company that is growing rapidly, and with that comes the challenge of navigating an environment with many moving parts, often without a clear-cut path laid out in front of us. If you're the kind of person who gets a kick out of being resourceful and loves solving problems, we would love to hear from you.<br><br>No doubt, Jane's a special place to work. There is autonomy and flexibility to help integrate work into your life in a way that makes sense for you. Need to block out time to pick up the kids? Go for it. That's normal here. And yes, we have a Slack channel for parents, but we've also got channels dedicated to plants, furry friends, food, pride, wellness - you get the idea! While we love to connect virtually, the Jane team also connects in person throughout the year.<br><br>We believe in collaboration, humility, and keeping a growth mindset.

As you may have noticed, this salary range is quite large, and this is intentional to account for the growth someone will experience in the role throughout their time at Jane (i.e., from building the skills, to accomplished, to highly proficient, all the way to achieving excellence in the role). When hiring talented folks to join the Jane team, we’ve found that new team members are best set up for success when hired with the expectation of being fully accomplished in the role, which for this role would reflect <strong>a starting salary of $89,300.<br><br></strong>It's also possible to join Jane at a salary above or below this, which would mean a salary below $89,300 typically reflects someone who has all the potential to be fully accomplished in the role but doesn't yet possess all the skills required, while a salary above $89,300 is typically for individuals who are currently in this role at Jane and had the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on our customers, product and company with deep Jane knowledge. At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.<br><br><em><strong>Paying clearly</strong> is one of our compensation fundamentals to help folks build trust in the compensation process at Jane. To better understand Jane’s compensation fundamentals and how this range is determined, </em> <em>click on this link here</em> <em> for a short video walkthrough of how it all works! We also welcome you to ask as many questions as you’d like about compensation throughout the interview process to ensure you feel confident and build trust through the process.<br><br></em><strong>More information on our benefits can be found here !<br><br></strong>At Jane, we’re committed to fostering an environment that allows you to come to work as your truest self. We believe it’s important to actively recognize, embrace, and celebrate our differences in order to make Jane an inclusive, equitable, and diverse workplace.<br><br>We want to build a team of people who make conversations rich with perspective and experience. We are committed to listening to every voice in order to learn and grow because doing this will allow us to meet the needs of the diverse community of helpers that Jane serves.<br><br>We do not tolerate discrimination, prejudice, or oppressive isms of any kind.

We encourage anyone who requires accommodation or adjustments throughout the interview process to let us know, and we will do our best to support you.

So why — despite the huge leaps we've taken in design and usability — does most business phone software still look, feel, and act like it was born in the 90s? OpenPhone is changing that.

We’re a new type of business phone with a mission to help people communicate better and be more productive.

We’re backed by Y Combinator and some of the best venture firms around including Tiger Global, Craft Ventures, Slow Ventures, and others. We take pride in providing an exceptional customer experience and a product people love, which is why we’re excited that our customers have rated us the #1 VoIP Provider on G2.

OpenPhone is the modern, sophisticated answer to the clunky, outdated phone systems that have been slowing down businesses for years. With thousands of happy customers and several rounds of funding in just five years, it's safe to say we're onto something big.

About The Role

We are hiring a Data Analyst with 4+ years of experience to primarily support our Go-To-Market (GTM) teams by providing insights and reporting to drive strategic decision-making. The ideal candidate will have strong analytical skills, experience with SQL, BI reporting tools, and a passion for translating data into actionable business insights. Experience in SaaS environments and familiarity with key SaaS metrics is highly desirable.

Some Of The Things You’ll Do


Develop and maintain dashboards and reports using BI tools (e.g., Mode, Tableau) to support GTM teams.
Analyze marketing, advertising, and sales data, including conversion funnel and cohort retention analyses, slicing data by attribution models, and providing customer lifecycle insights.
Collaborate with stakeholders across sales, marketing, and customer success to define key metrics and reporting needs.
Write efficient SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data from various sources.
Assist in data modeling and transformation using dbt (a plus but not required).
Comfortable with working large and complex data coming from multiple sources such as Kafka events or web traffic data from ad platforms.
Communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Ensure data accuracy, integrity, and security in all reporting and analysis efforts.


About You


4+ years of experience in data analysis, preferably in a SaaS environment.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills with a quantitative mindset.
Familiarity with analytics engineering and dbt (a plus).
Excellent communication skills with the ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical audiences.
Ability to thrive in a high-paced, high-growth environment.
Experience managing data projects and collaborating with cross-functional teams.

SF Bay Area, Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Boston, New York, and Washington, DC Metro: $158,000 - $176,000 USD
All other US Locations: $141,000 - $156,000 USD
Canada: 160,000 - $178,000 CAD


The ranges displayed reflect the target for new hire salaries, and within each range, individual pay is determined by your skills and experience, as well as relevant education. Your recruiter can share more and answer questions about the specific salary range during the hiring process.

Salary is just one component of OpenPhone’s total compensation package. Your total rewards package will include equity, extensive medical coverage, a monthly lifestyle stipend, and a flexible PTO policy.

Who We Are

As a fully remote company, we thrive asynchronously as a team. We are curious, ambitious, and dedicated to our work. We value trust above all else, and have a strong bias for action. If you're looking for a place to do your life's work, please get in touch. We'd love to hear from you.

And remember, there's no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. We're looking for optimists with grit and determination, who are excited to face the challenges of a growing startup. OpenPhone is the type of company where you can grow, and we encourage you to apply for this role even if you don't think you meet all the requirements.

We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment. It is important that you are able to bring your authentic self to work every day.

Develop and automate reporting workflows to improve team efficiency.

Collaborate with stakeholders to define KPIs and success metrics for GTM initiatives, including product-led growth metrics (user acquisition, activation, retention, etc.) by developing data strategies to provide these insights.
Provide regular insights and recommendations to the leadership team.


What We Are Looking For


Experience at a high growth B2B SaaS company.
Strong understanding of go to market motions, sales metrics, and marketing metrics.
Knowledge of SQL, and widely used tools like Salesforce, Snowflake, and dbt.
Proficiency in data visualization tools (Tableau, Looker, metabase, etc).
Ability to give and process constructive feedback, as well as work independently.
Ability to communicate openly, supporting and championing innovation.
Flexibility to adjust to the dynamic nature of a startup, and adept at dealing with ambiguity.


As a company, we strive to maintain fair compensation practices within our team across all roles and all levels.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists, and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you’ll do

About The Internship Experience

Our internship program provides the opportunity to work on meaningful business initiatives that will grow the GDP of the internet. Through the internship, you will work with many systems and technologies, gain experience in working with large datasets and analytical methodologies/tools to help us better understand our users and build better products.

Each intern has a dedicated mentor, and every intern project is part of the team's roadmap that will directly contribute to Stripe's mission. As you collaborate with industry experts on initiatives that expand global commerce, you will develop a strong first-hand understanding of the role analytics plays in steering business strategy and results.

We're not just focused on your immediate contributions; we're invested in your growth. Stripe sees this internship as an opportunity to grow your technical expertise and facilitate personal development, preparing you for a career in the tech industry.

Responsibilities

You will:


Partner closely with Data Scientists, Data Analysts, and business partners to drive business impact through rigorous analytical solutions

Influence business actions and strategy by developing actionable insights through metrics and dashboards.
Drive the collection of new data and the refinement of existing data sources.
Learn quickly by asking great questions, finding how to work with your mentor and teammates effectively, and communicating the status of your work clearly
Present your work to the Data Science team, partner teams, and fellow interns



Who you are

Minimum Requirements

We’re looking for someone who has:


Enrolled in a quantitative Master's program (e.g. Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Economics, Statistics, or Computer Science) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2025 or spring/summer 2026
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources
Define and monitor key economic impact metrics
Go deep on understanding business drivers, user segments, cohorts and macroeconomic trends
Prepare presentations, analyses and visualizations for internal and external executive audiences
Partner closely with Communications, Policy, Marketing and Product teams to identify and analyze key trends and produce thought leadership pieces and campaign content leveraging Stripe data
Collaborate with external vendors, academics, and think tanks to advance Stripe’s research agenda and advocacy positions



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our Business Intelligence Specialist will enable a data-driven strategy at Resolver by building dashboards and providing insights on key results. This is a role where you will work with stakeholders across the business to define how data impacts our business. The future state is a data-centric culture where leaders are empowered with self-service data for decision-making. You will drive conversations across the company on the insights in our data and how we can use them to improve results.

About Resolver:

Resolver is a high-growth SaaS company whose intuitive, no-code platform gives our customers a clear picture of their risks so they can make quick and effective decisions. As a part of the Resolver team, your work will help transform risk management to risk intelligence so organizations can protect people and assets and deliver on their purpose.

We are ambitious in both our mission and our culture. As a business within Kroll, we offer an innovative, non-hierarchical work environment blended with the stability and financial security of an enterprise. Resolver has also been named one of Canada’s Great Places to Work six years in a row!

What you'll be doing:

Data Analysis (60%)


Serve as a centralized reporting agent for all divisions at Resolver, adjusting monthly reports with updated data sources and resolving issues with current reporting as required
Provide new reporting, dashboards and other visualization to the business that will support growth
Proactively identify trends and business insights that improve results against core corporate KPIs: ARR, win-rate, back-to-base revenue
Collaborate with key stakeholders on division-level reports across services, product, sales, marketing and division leads
Ability to break down complex business challenges, identify root causes and develop data-driven solutions is crucial



Data Management(30%)


Detect data quality issues and their root causes; implement fixes and design data audits to capture the issues in the future
Monitor dashboards to ensure they’re functioning properly. Troubleshoot when issues arise
Maintain standards for key metrics to avoid inconsistency in reporting across dashboards and teams
Make use of historical metrics when setting up reporting, with aim of enabling teams to deliver and exceed on division-level and corporate-level objectives
Write and maintain documentation to support our goal of being a data-centric culture; support data integrity. Document untapped data sources that teams could leverage in future reporting



Strategy (10%)


Regularly report to stakeholders on the business impact of the BI infrastructure and BI-related projects
Understand stakeholder requirements and anticipate future needs as it relates to data and data management
Continuously advance our data culture by researching the market and recommending industry best-practices



What you bring to the table:


3-5 years work experience working with BI tools (e.g. Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Domo).
Expert at building intuitive, well-thought-out dashboards that users love. A keen eye for data visualization and finding elegant solutions for making complex data understandable
2+ years data modelling, analysis, cleaning and QA
Experience with SQL
Post Secondary degree is required



Nice to haves:


Background in analytics, mathematics or another quantitative field would be amazing
Experience with Python or R is a plus. Experience with predictive data analytics and data viz libraries would be a big asset (e.g. Scikit-learn, SciPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Plotly)
Experience with Snowflake would be a major asset, as would experience with CRM data



What we’ll give you in return:

Resolver is one of Canada's Great Workplaces. Culture isn't just something we write about (although we do), we live our values and challenge each other to be our best selves. We invest in Resolverites who will grow with us. We have a comprehensive rewards package to show our team our appreciation for everything they do:

We know how important it is to have a good boss, so we invest in their development.

Chainlink Labs is the primary contributing developer of Chainlink, the decentralized computing platform powering the verifiable web. Chainlink is the industry-standard platform for providing access to real-world data, offchain computation, and secure cross-chain interoperability across any blockchain. Chainlink Labs helps power verifiable applications for banking, DeFi, global trade, and gaming by collaborating with some of the world’s largest financial institutions, notably Swift, DTCC, and ANZ. Chainlink Labs also works with top Web3 teams, including Aave, Compound, GMX, Maker, and Synthetix. Chainlink Labs was ranked in Newsweek’s 100 Most Loved Workplaces 2023 in both the United States and United Kingdom.

Chainlink Labs is pioneering the world’s first fully sustainable and decentralized oracle network, and the Economics team is searching for a Senior Analyst to play a critical role in building it. This role will sit at the intersection of blockchain technology, financial innovation, and economic systems, and shape the future of decentralized economics.

As a Senior Analyst, you will combine economics, data science, and blockchain expertise to shape incentives, optimize network design, and influence the decision-making of our Economics and Executive Leadership teams. You will design, analyze, and operationalize economic models for production applications. You will collaborate across departments to bring innovative solutions from concept to production, ensuring economic soundness and scalability throughout.

This is a high-impact role, offering visibility and influence as you contribute to the development of the Chainlink network. If you’re a meticulous, creative, and motivated individual ready to solve complex economic problems through data-driven decisions in the rapidly evolving world of Web3, this is the role for you.

Your Impact


You'll serve two primary functions: (1) designing and performing analyses that help the Economics and Executive Leadership teams make informed, data-driven decisions, and (2) building and maintaining systems for the parameterization of production applications.
You'll work on a wide array of blockchain economics projects, analyses, and systems, including:
Designing novel mechanisms and incentive schemes
Building models and simulations to evaluate investment opportunities
Designing and parameterizing trading systems
Optimizing parameters for production applications
Contributing to the design of Economics programs and applications
You'll optimize network incentives and systems by engaging directly with the Economics, Product, Engineering, Research, and Data Science teams to understand network dynamics at the deepest level.
You'll operationalize processes and analytics systems, and coordinate cross-functionally to implement them.
This is both a highly technical and highly social role. You will have high visibility and a large impact on how Chainlink builds the world’s first fully sustainable decentralized oracle network.

Requirements


5+ years experience in a quantitative role, particularly trading or quant research
A deep understanding of financial and crypto markets and incentives
Extensive financial modeling background, including data engineering and model automation
Strong SQL and Python skills are mandatory
Experience solving economic problems through statistical/econometric analyses
Substantial data analysis and/or data science experience
Meticulous attention to detail.


Preferred Qualifications


Strong Economics and/or Finance background through Masters-level academics and/or multiple years of industry experience.
Strong organizational and coordination skills necessary to productionize/operationalize processes and applications.
Preferably smart contract programming experience (Rust, Go, Solidity), but familiarity with smart contract code and dApp architecture at a minimum
Published research with an economics or crypto focus (e.g., papers on MEV or PBS, staking and slashing dynamics, node compensation, tokenomics, etc.)


All roles with Chainlink Labs are global and remote-based. Unless otherwise stated, we ask that you try to overlap some working hours with Eastern Standard Time (EST).

We are looking for a Quantitative Equity Analyst to join our Quantitative Equity Team!
