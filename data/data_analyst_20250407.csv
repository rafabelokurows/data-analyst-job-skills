Research Internships at Microsoft provide a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers, who pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.

Data systems research at MSR focuses on all aspects of large-scale cloud data systems including infrastructure for managing cloud services, caching, storage, transactional and analytic databases, distributed databases, and vector databases. Our goals include reducing the total cost of ownership of systems using techniques such as auto-tuning, query optimization and processing, approximate query processing, and exploiting modern hardware to push the envelope of performance, reliability, and cost.

The group also focuses on data exploration, novel ways to accelerate discovering insights from data. We are interested in a variety of topics in this area, including techniques to enable self-service data cleaning and transformation at scale, search over structured data, meta-data management, use of machine learning for database systems, and information extraction.

During this Research Internship, you will have the opportunity to work with top researchers and engineers at MSR to develop innovative solutions to challenging research problems in the above technical areas.

Technology arising from our data systems research has been incorporated into Microsoft’s data and computing platforms such as SQL Server, Azure SQL DB, the Microsoft AI Platform, Azure Stream Analytics, Bing, and PowerBI. Many of our systems artifacts have been open-sourced and have had broad impact in industry and academia. Our research has also had a significant impact on the academic community with influential publications at top conferences such as SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, KDD, and WWW, including multiple best paper awards and test-of-time awards.

Microsoft’s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As employees we come together with a growth mindset, innovate to empower others, and collaborate to realize our shared goals. Each day we build on our values of respect, integrity, and accountability to create a culture of inclusion where everyone can thrive at work and beyond.

Millions of people across the world come to Pinterest to find new ideas every day. It’s where they get inspiration, dream about new possibilities and plan for what matters most. Our mission is to help those people find their inspiration and create a life they love. In your role, you’ll be challenged to take on work that upholds this mission and pushes Pinterest forward. You’ll grow as a person and leader in your field, all the while helping Pinners make their lives better in the positive corner of the internet.

Creating a life you love also means finding a career that celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences that you bring. As you read through the expectations of the position, consider how your skills and experiences may complement the responsibilities of the role. We encourage you to think through your relevant and transferable skills from prior experiences.

Our new progressive work model is called PinFlex, a term that’s uniquely Pinterest to describe our flexible approach to living and working. Visit our PinFlex landing page to learn more.

The Sales Strategy & Operations (SS&O) team partners with advertising sales leaders across sales strategy and analytics, operations and process and tools. Team members are experts in business strategy and operations and analytical and strategic thinking. They are pragmatic and results-oriented. As a Data Analyst, you will focus on empowering sales leadership and the broader sales organization with self-serve access to data and insights. You’ll be responsible for designing, building and maintaining scaled sales analytics solutions (dashboards, data tables) for over one thousand internal users.

What You’ll Do


Collaborate with SS&O team members and sales leaders to define key business metrics and gather requirements for which insights should be made available at scale. Architect data pipelines, design and build new Tableau dashboards for stakeholders to use to address their needs. Maintain and improve existing sales data infrastructure and Tableau dashboards based on evolving business requirements.
Democratize sales data by enabling self-serve access to key business drivers, trends and operating metrics. Design fully automated dashboards that are easy to understand, enable self-serve access for the sales org, and can be used by a broad audience with a variety of use cases.
Publish and maintain clear documentation to inform and educate users at scale, gather feedback to identify opportunities for improvement.
Identify ways to streamline and improve the efficiency of our data. Implement changes to our infrastructure (optimize SQL queries and data workflows) to improve the landing time of our data.
Work with cross-functional teams including Sales, Strategic Finance, and Data Analytics to identify data needs and gaps, and align on solutions.
Lead projects end to end, see around corners and provide thought partnership to your team.



What We’re Looking For


3+ years of professional experience in highly analytical environments such as management consulting, investment banking, corporate strategy or technology/media companies.
Understanding of sales and digital advertising platforms and working knowledge of sales systems and tools (Salesforce).
Strong data analytics and data analyst skills - querying large data sets with advanced SQL, building visualizations with Tableau. Experience building and maintaining data pipelines (authoring, scheduling, monitoring workflows).
Ability to visualize complex data sets that provide insights and clearly inform areas of action.
Passion for building new solutions and enabling analysis at scale to drive decision-making.
Experience in a complex, fast-paced environment.
Organized, detail-oriented and strategically focused.
Strong written and verbal communication skills.
Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as business administration, or equivalent experience.



Relocation Statement:


This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.



In-Office Requirement Statement


We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.
This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 1-2 times/month and therefore needs to be in a commutable distance from the NY office.



At Pinterest we believe the workplace should be equitable, inclusive, and inspiring for every employee. In an effort to provide greater transparency, we are sharing the base salary range for this position. The position is also eligible for equity. Final salary is based on a number of factors including location, travel, relevant prior experience, or particular skills and expertise.

Information regarding the culture at Pinterest and benefits available for this position can be found here.

US based applicants only

$80,710—$166,168 USD

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Payment Intelligence Engineering’s purpose is to mitigate threats to our systems in order to keep our merchants, Stripe and financial partners safe. We empower global businesses with intelligent solutions for conversion and fraud prevention, leveraging consumer intelligence and transparent ML to maximize growth and build trust. Our Payments Intelligence portfolio delivers actionable insights to all user segments.

The Payments Health Technical Operations team is pioneering new ways to achieve this mission. Our dynamic team relies on the expertise of integration reliability engineers and data analysts to identify gaps and build comprehensive solutions in the ever changing arena of fraud prevention.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and maintain SQL queries to analyze and navigate complex financial data effectively.
Enhance overall observability by identifying gaps and proposing actionable insights to improve our monitoring systems.
Actively hunt for patterns and anomalies in data that could indicate potential threats or operational issues.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to consolidate and gather relevant data for informed engineering efforts.
Design and implement comprehensive dashboards for real-time visibility into key metrics and system health.
Establish and refine key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress and improvements over time.
Support the creation and maintenance of observability frameworks to ensure early detection of issues.
Contribute to efforts that reduce organizational toil by optimizing data analysis processes.
Communicate findings and insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Stay updated with industry trends in data analysis and financial data handling to ensure best practices.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have 5+ years of experience in Payments at a leading technology or payments company
Have experience writing SQL to query relational databases
Have experience managing communications and workflows with technical and non-technical teams across internal and external stakeholders
Experience mentoring junior team members in technical skill development, operational strategy and problem solving
Have experience navigating the nuanced complexity of financial systems and solving large scale, technical challenges
Have strong financial modeling and analytical skills to investigate, prioritize, and identify the root cause of issues
Have experience managing multiple, concurrent work streams, identifying and triaging technical issues and driving solutions with clear metrics to show impact



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,400 - $219,600. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

This is a cross-functional role, working closely with Sales, Revenue Operations, Support, Marketing, and other teams to translate data into meaningful narratives, and self-service tools that improve operational efficiency and drive growth.

You’ll help internal teams across the business make decisions using data and visualizations. The ability to think on one’s feet, enjoy collaborating with highly technical teams, and be comfortable working asynchronously is essential.

Analyze sales pipeline, conversion rates, and customer acquisition metrics to identify trends and opportunities.
Develop and automate reporting workflows to improve team efficiency.
Create and maintain documentation of data sources, metrics definitions, and analysis methodologies.

Provide regular insights and recommendations to the leadership team.


What We Are Looking For


Experience at a high growth B2B SaaS company.
Strong understanding of go to market motions, sales metrics, and marketing metrics.
Knowledge of SQL, and widely used tools like Salesforce, Snowflake, and dbt.
Proficiency in data visualization tools (Tableau, Looker, metabase, etc).
Ability to give and process constructive feedback, as well as work independently.
Ability to communicate openly, supporting and championing innovation.
Flexibility to adjust to the dynamic nature of a startup, and adept at dealing with ambiguity.


As a company, we strive to maintain fair compensation practices within our team across all roles and all levels.

What We Offer


An inclusive, flexible environment where you can be your authentic self. We recognize the impact of diverse voices and backgrounds on the growth of our people, product, and company. And that flexibility in how and when you work empowers our team to integrate work and life.
A competitive total compensation package. This includes a base salary, an equity incentive plan and variable commission (for quota-based roles).
Comprehensive group benefits with no waiting period. Take advantage of coverage for health, vision, dental, and more for you and your family!

Paid time off and a healthy work-life integration. Our flexible, paid time off program supports you for any situation life throws your way, whether moving homes or travelling the world!

Privacy Statement




All member records are protected according to our Privacy Policy. Further, while employees of Headspace (formerly Ginger) cannot access Headspace products/services, they will be offered benefits according to the company's benefit plan. To ensure we are adhering to best practice and ethical guidelines in the field of mental health, we take care to avoid dual relationships.

If someone with a Headspace account is hired for a position, please note their account will be deactivated and they will not be able to use Headspace services for the duration of their employment. 




Further, if Headspace cannot find a role that fails to resolve an ethical issue associated with a dual relationship, Headspace may need to take steps to ensure ethical obligations are being adhered to, including a delayed start date or a potential leave of absence. Such steps would be taken to protect both the former member, as well as any relevant individuals from their care team, from impairment, risk of exploitation, or harm.

Job Description

- Our client is looking to build a team of Data Scientists to support real-time transcription of their high-volume contact centers based virtually and throughout the United States.

- The team currently has Speech Analysts, and they are looking to expand their capabilities to provide real-time text data transcription and sentiment analysis, and use AI instead of audio.

o Designs, tests, and documents processes, SQL queries, and stored procedures.

o Support some manual labeling of data

Hands-on experience with Databricks or other big data processing platforms.
Knowledge of A/B testing methodologies and marketing analytics.
