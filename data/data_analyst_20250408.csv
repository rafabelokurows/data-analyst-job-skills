Getreu unserem Motto – People is what makes us us – sind uns deine nachhaltige Ausbildung und Weiterentwicklung, deine ausgeglichene Work-Life-Balance und deine Happiness sehr wichtig. Konkret stellen wir mit 32 Urlaubstagen, 60 % mobilem Arbeiten, bis zu 4 Wochen pro Jahr – im europäischen Ausland – der Möglichkeit remote zu arbeiten, Sabbatical und Überstundenausgleich sicher, dass dir im FUSE-Agentur-Leben nichts fehlt.

In unserem derzeit über 60-köpfigen Team sowie unseren Kund*innen haben wir unser perfektes Match bereits gefunden. Wenn du noch auf der Suche bist, bei „popkulturellem Relevanzmarketing“ neugierig wirst und für Social Media, Influencer Marketing oder Gaming & Esports brennst, dann lass uns zusammen loslegen! Denn : Action Creates Impact .

Dein Job

Als (Junior) Insights Analyst (mensch) bearbeitest du als Teil unseres Data und Analytics Teams in erster Linie die Anfragen unserer Kunden nach Social Media Reportings sowie Social Listening Analysen und beherrschst den Spagat zwischen analytischem und kreativem Denken, um die Kolleg:Innen in deinem und anderen Teams mit datenbasierten Insights zu Kundenmeinungen, Märkten, Zielgruppen, Marken und ihren Social Media-Umfeldern zu versorgen.

Dein Aufgabenbereich

Datenbeschaffung / Toolbedienung

Du bist präzise, schnell, zuverlässig und motiviert, wenn es um die manuelle Erfassung großer (Social Media)- Datenmengen geht, aber auch wissbegierig und begeisterungsfähig, dich diesbezüglich kontinuierlich mit Prozessoptimierung zu befassen, sowie dich in Tools und automatisierte Datenerfassungsprozesse und Methoden einzudenken, um immer bessere Lösungen zu finden.

Datenstrukturierung, Effiziente Datensammlung, Query Writing, Kategorisierung und Datendarstellung werden hier deine täglichen Begleiter.

Studiendurchführung

Von der (manchmal noch recht schwammigen) Fragestellung bis zum fertigen Analysebericht mit guten Insights und Handlungsempfehlungen ist es oft ein weiter aber spannender Weg. Der kann bald auch deiner sein, gemeinsam mit uns im Team.

Du hast ein sehr gutes Gespür für Sprache und Kommunikation? Nice, das brauchst du hier in mindestens dreierlei Hinsicht: Erstens, um aus den Aussagen und Briefings unserer Auftraggeber herausfiltern zu können, wie du ihnen am besten weiterhelfen kannst. Zweitens, wenn es darum geht, die Essenz von Konsumenten-Posts und Kommentaren auf Social Media zu verstehen, schließlich ist Inhaltanalyse unser Daily-Business. Und Drittens, um dann Deine Findings Zielgruppengerecht rüberzubringen - in Reports, in Meetings und bei Präsentationen.

Datenanalyse

Auswertungslogiken passend zu den gegebenen Fragestellungen und Erkenntnisinteressen erstellen, Dimensionierungen & Kategorisierungen für Inhaltsanalysen planen und entwickeln, Daten auszählen, filtern, darstellen, vergleichen, interpretieren, daraus kreative Idee und Empfehlungen ableiten. Das ist dein Playground. Deine Affinität zu Zahlen und Daten kannst du hier immer wieder beweisen. Ein stets strukturiertes Vorgehen und ein souveräner Umgang auch mit großen und komplexen Datenmengen, Statistiken und Zahlen sind für dich selbstverständlich.

Spezielle Social Media Analyse-Tools wirst Du ebenso (kennenlernen und) zum Einsatz bringen wie ganz viel Excel und das gute alte Powerpoint.

Das bringst du mit

Du kannst (erste) Erfahrung in der qualitativen und quantitativen Forschungsarbeit, sowie in der marketing- oder kundenorientierten Projektarbeit vorweisen und hast Lust dich im Bereich Social Media Analytics weiter auszutoben. Du hast, dank deines Studiums, einen kommunikations-, sozial- oder medienwissenschaftlichen Background und bringst Kenntnisse der Methoden im Bereich der quantitativen und qualitativen Marktforschung mit. Du hast neben den analytischen Fähigkeiten, auch ein Gespür für gute kreative Kommunikation und Lust, diese mitzuentwickeln. Du bist organisiert und selbständig, willst aber auch noch ständig ganz viel lernen und verstehst dich als Teamplayer, der immer auf Höhe des Zeitgeists ist und daraus neue Impulse für unsere Teams und Kunden ableitet. Außerdem hast Du sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse in Wort und Schrift, sehr gute MS Office Kenntnisse, insbesondere Excel und PowerPoint und bist im besten Fall mit Analytics Tools im Bereich Social Listening & Web Analytics vertraut.

Darum wir

Als Teil der FUSE erfährst du stets Rückenwind von deinem Team, arbeitest für Kunden - die unsere Werte „BOLD. TRUE. EASY. TOGETHER.“ leben und kannst aktiv Prozesse und Strukturen mitentwickeln. Denn ganz getreu unserem Wert TOGETHER setzen wir auf das Potential im Team. Neben unvergesslichen Events bieten wir dir viel Raum für persönliche und berufliche Weiterentwicklung.

Agreena is an exciting, dynamic, and purpose-oriented organisation united in a mission to mobilise farmers and corporations to unlock the value of nature and help restore the planet. While we’re rooted in agriculture, finance, and technology, our team of experts range from soil carbon scientists and software developers to market strategists and regulatory affairs experts. Over 160 employees across more than 30 nationalities are gathered under the common Agreena flag – either working from our headquarters in Copenhagen, offices in London, or remotely across Europe.

As a rapidly scaling climate agtech, Agreena provides solutions that drive both environmental and financial sustainability in farming. We have helped farmers across 20 countries in their journey from conventional agriculture to regenerative farming practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, storing it in soil. Our company offers a supportive and positive work environment with opportunities for learning, leading and growth no matter where you are in your professional journey. We believe in giving our employees a lot of responsibility, and we encourage new thinking, innovation and fun.

Across both, we are looking to better understand and explain our data in order to bolster our scientific rigour. You will sit between both teams and should be confident working with different types of statistical analysis, process-based modelling, and sampling/stratification.

Equally, you should have a good understanding of statistical modelling and bring a fresh perspective to our machine learning and process-based approaches. Thus, you will be a strong communicator capable of translating complex analysis into simplified insights to both internal and external stakeholders.

The Programme and Data teams are integral to the scientific operations of the company, and you will work closely together with them and our Product teams to ensure state of the art science drives our world leading carbon platform. As such, you will be part of a dynamic and high-paced work environment constantly subject to innovation.

How Will You Make An Impact


Estimating uncertainty and error propagation in our models;
Applying Bayesian methods for the calibration of complex process-based models;
Designing sampling strategies for our data collection campaigns;

Working with temporal and spatial data;
Experience coding in R;
Handling unstructured and messy data.
Strong scientific writing, report creation and communication skills to audiences with a range of technical expertise.


Bonus Points If You Have


Masters or PhD in one of the relevant Science fields mentioned above;
A baseline understanding of greenhouse gas accounting frameworks and methodologies;
Strong theoretical background in Bayesian Statistics;

Experience coding in Python;


What’s In It For You


A unique opportunity to join and help shape a fast-growing tech scale up with the determination and ambitious mission to reverse climate change;
A truly global environment where you can collaborate and socialise with diverse and passionate colleagues;
Competitive compensation package and holidays;
Centrally located modern office in Copenhagen or London and the option to work from home a couple days a week;
Team events throughout the year;
An exciting purpose-led culture and mission;

Wir arbeiten in einer Holokratie – das bedeutet: keine starren Hierarchien, keine langen Entscheidungswege, sondern Verantwortung von Tag eins an. Wenn du gestalten willst, statt nur zu verwalten, bist du hier richtig.







Deine Aufgaben

Zukunftsperspektive: Du treibst das Thema Daten in der Organisation voran und hast die Möglichkeit, unser Data-Team mit aufzubauen.







Dein Profil




Analytische Stärke & Business-Sinn – Du verstehst, welche Zahlen wirklich relevant sind und wie man sie sinnvoll nutzt.
Kommerzielles Gespür – Du erkennst, welche datenbasierten Entscheidungen direkten Einfluss auf das Geschäft haben.
Visualisierung – Du bereitest Daten so auf, dass sie sofort verständlich und einprägsam sind.
Storytelling mit Daten – Du kannst aus Zahlen eine klare, überzeugende Geschichte machen, die Entscheidungen vorantreibt.
Eigenverantwortung & Proaktivität – Du wartest nicht auf Aufgaben, sondern siehst, was getan werden muss – und setzt es um.
Erfahrung in der Datenanalyse – 3-5 Jahre Erfahrung mit SQL, idealerweise ergänzt durch Tableau, Power BI oder Looker.
Technisches Verständnis – Du kannst mit APIs umgehen und hast Grundkenntnisse in der Datenintegration.
Kommunikation auf Augenhöhe – Du kannst mit Sales, Marketing und Management sprechen – und bringst deine Analysen auf den Punkt.







Das bekommst du von uns




Täglicher Team-Lunch – Dein Mittagessen geht auf uns.
Firmenfitness – Zugang zu Gympass, Wellpass oder Urban Sports.
Weiterbildung & Coaching – Dein Budget für Schulungen & Konferenzen.
Ausstattung nach Wahl – Laptop, Monitor & Headset nach deinen Bedürfnissen.
Mehr Eigenverantwortung – Entscheidungen treffen, statt auf Vorgaben warten.
Klare Rollen & Transparenz – Jeder weiß, wer wofür verantwortlich ist.
Gestaltungsspielraum – Deine Ideen bewegen etwas – in Prozessen, Strategie & Technologie.
Interdisziplinäre Zusammenarbeit – Arbeiten in Kreisen, nicht in Abteilungen.
Betriebliche Altersvorsorge – 40 € VWL + 25 € Zuschuss von uns.
Team-Workshops & Offsites – Zweimal im Jahr gemeinsame Strategie & Weiterentwicklung.
Flexibel & agil – Deine Rolle wächst mit dir, nicht umgekehrt.

The Programme and Data teams are integral to the scientific operations of the company, and you will work closely together with them and our Product teams to ensure state of the art science drives our world leading carbon platform. As such, you will be part of a dynamic and high-paced work environment constantly subject to innovation.

Our story - continued commitment to doing the right thing

2005 seems like a long time ago. Simply Business - a small company with a big idea. To transform the way that other small businesses could get the insurance that they need. To reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that small businesses are entitled to. To protect them from harm. To keep their livelihoods safe. And to do all this with the promise of positive service. Delivered by happy people, working flexibly, learning constantly. With a restlessly innovative spirit. Within a business committed to doing the right thing. All of the time.

As we’ve grown, we’ve tried hard to keep true to this. To ourselves, to our 800 strong team and to the 3.5m customers that we’ve served so far. And as we move forward, as we enter a big new market, as we grow responsibly, as we improve our products, as we offer our customers more of what they need, of what they deserve, we’ll hold onto the focus of that small company with the big idea. Protecting and serving businesses across the UK and the US. From barbers to bakers, consultants to cleaners, they are the backbone of the economy.

And we’ll continue to stand by them. Bit by bit helping their dreams grow, just like ours.

Why do we need this role?

As a Staff Data Analyst, you will be part of a team, championing the use of data within our organization, and ensuring that insight is driven with a clear strategy aligned to our business outcomes and growing operations. You will also be joining a much broader, award winning international data team that is doing some really exciting things with the latest Big Data and analytics technologies.

Enable self-service for business stakeholders through best-in-class tooling.
Have an eagerness to improve analytical techniques through a variety of sources, including leveraging our data science and data engineering teams.
Have the opportunity to work with stakeholders in a high-pace, agile environment which encourages autonomy and growth.
Contribute to and drive forward changes to team strategy.


Responsibilities Include


Delivery of high quality analysis and recommendations to support the Product Teams and help them achieve their objectives
Carry out customer journey analysis
Measure the impact of multi-channel strategies
Uncover and deliver insight through ad-hoc data exploration and visualization
Work with our data engineers to evolve our data sets and data pipelines
Build dashboards and self-service query tools and train colleagues to use them
Promote the output and capabilities of the analysis team across the business to help foster a company-wide data driven culture
Mentor more junior members of the team, and work with managers to drive development on both an individual and team level.


What Are We Looking For


6+ years of experience as an Analyst/Data Scientist
Expert SQL Knowledge
Proven aptitude for problem solving and experimenting (A/B tests)
Collaborating across cross-functional teams
Proven aptitude for analysis of data and problem solving
A degree in STEM, Economics, or similar
The ability to challenge us! We want people who can come in and shape the future of this business, not afraid to raise questions and help us improve
Insurance knowledge is a plus!


The Benefits

There’s all the serious (but important) stuff we call “core benefits” and a salary that reflects your experience, our pay policy and the market we’re in from your first day is a global approach. However, some of our “core benefits” differ from the UK to the US to keep us competitive.

These range from life cover, a cash plan and a stakeholder pension in the UK to medical, dental, vision, and prescription drug coverage, short and long term disability, life insurance coverage and participation in 401(k) plan with a 3% employer match in the US.

The Fun stuff!

We are really proud of our culture at SB and that reflects in how our benefits roll. Flexible benefits and working, plenty of training to help you develop your career and loads of clubs to get involved in from trivia nights, guest speakers, and charity drives keep us all well connected. And, the great thing is being remote hasn’t stopped us one bit.

And, the great thing is being remote hasn’t stopped us one bit.

Prolific

Prolific is not just another player in the AI space – we are the architects of the human data infrastructure that's reshaping the landscape of AI development. In a world where foundational AI technologies are increasingly commoditized, it's the quality and diversity of human-generated data that truly differentiates products and models.

The role

As a Human Data Analyst within our Human Data Team with specific expertise in building forecast and tracking models in google sheets. You will play a critical role in building the pricing infrastructure and forecasting capability that powers Prolific's specialised human data supply. This is a unique opportunity to shape how we model and scale participant acquisition and engagement across global channels, helping to drive efficiency, performance, and strategic decision-making at the heart of our business.

In this hands-on, high-impact role, you'll design and build dynamic pricing models, forecast demand and supply across acquisition pipelines, and collaborate with data and ops teams to structure your work for long-term integration into our data warehouse. You'll enable better planning and scaling across our AI-focused delivery efforts while directly influencing financial and operational strategy.

This contract role is ideal for a deeply technical, analytically minded operator who thrives on building clarity from scratch, loves clean spreadsheets and thoughtful structure, can provide meaningful insights and updates and can collaborate across teams to deliver results fast.

What you'll bring to the role

Essential Skills & Experience


4+ years in an operations, strategy, or data analyst role with direct ownership of pricing, forecasting, or workforce planning models.
Expert-level proficiency in Google Sheets or Excel, including array formulas, pivot tables, query functions, automation via Apps Script, and complex modeling logic.
Strong SQL skills, with a track record of integrating model inputs/outputs with broader data infrastructure.
Proven ability to design, implement, and scale bespoke models and tools in ambiguous or greenfield environments.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills, with confidence in presenting insights to leadership.
Highly organized with strong attention to detail and a bias toward action and iteration.


Preferred Experience


Experience in crowdsourcing, human data platforms, or participant/marketplace operations.
Familiarity with supporting AI/ML lifecycle projects, including domain-specific recruitment or task curation.
Understanding of data warehousing platforms (e.g Redshift, Snowflake).
Experience in fast-paced environments where speed, clarity, and flexibility are essential.


What you'll be doing in the role

Strategic Planning & Enablement


Take ownership of pricing, forecasting, and resource modeling across Prolific's human data channels, including domain experts, global crowd, and AI taskers.
Develop frameworks to assess ROI across acquisition efforts and inform strategic investment decisions.
Work directly with the COO and functional leads to align forecasting models with company-level planning and budget assumptions.
Lead operational readiness initiatives by developing repeatable, scalable templates and tools.
Present insights to executive stakeholders and adjust models based on feedback and evolving needs.


Forecasting, Modeling & Data Infrastructure


Build dynamic Google Sheets (or Excel) models to project participant supply, pricing, and engagement costs across different acquisition channels.
Apply scenario analysis to model key variables such as hourly rates, incentives, onboarding time, and conversion rates.
Use SQL to extract data from internal systems to validate assumptions, power models, and ensure consistency with business metrics.
Fine-tune model outputs for seamless upload to our data warehouse, working in close collaboration with our data team.
Create clear documentation and training materials to ensure adoption and scalability of tools across teams.


Operational Execution & Continuous Improvement


Partner with acquisition, onboarding, and support teams to ensure pricing and supply forecasts are grounded in operational reality.
Act as a bridge between strategy and operations — turning ambiguous goals into actionable, data-backed roadmaps.
Identify inefficiencies in current modeling, planning, or reporting processes and propose improvements.
Contribute to the creation of live dashboards, automated reporting workflows, and model health checks.
Support project tracking and measurement of outcomes through rigorous data analysis and performance reviews.

Our story - continued commitment to doing the right thing

2005 seems like a long time ago. Simply Business - a small company with a big idea. To transform the way that other small businesses could get the insurance that they need. To reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that small businesses are entitled to. To protect them from harm. To keep their livelihoods safe. And to do all this with the promise of positive service. Delivered by happy people, working flexibly, learning constantly. With a restlessly innovative spirit. Within a business committed to doing the right thing. All of the time.

As we’ve grown, we’ve tried hard to keep true to this. To ourselves, to our 800 strong team and to the 3.5m customers that we’ve served so far. And as we move forward, as we enter a big new market, as we grow responsibly, as we improve our products, as we offer our customers more of what they need, of what they deserve, we’ll hold onto the focus of that small company with the big idea. Protecting and serving businesses across the UK and the US. From barbers to bakers, consultants to cleaners, they are the backbone of the economy.

And we’ll continue to stand by them. Bit by bit helping their dreams grow, just like ours.

Why do we need this role?

As a Staff Data Analyst, you will be part of a team, championing the use of data within our organization, and ensuring that insight is driven with a clear strategy aligned to our business outcomes and growing operations. You will also be joining a much broader, award winning international data team that is doing some really exciting things with the latest Big Data and analytics technologies.

Contribute to and drive forward changes to team strategy.


Responsibilities Include


Delivery of high quality analysis and recommendations to support the Product Teams and help them achieve their objectives
Carry out customer journey analysis
Measure the impact of multi-channel strategies
Uncover and deliver insight through ad-hoc data exploration and visualization
Work with our data engineers to evolve our data sets and data pipelines
Build dashboards and self-service query tools and train colleagues to use them
Promote the output and capabilities of the analysis team across the business to help foster a company-wide data driven culture
Mentor more junior members of the team, and work with managers to drive development on both an individual and team level.


What Are We Looking For


6+ years of experience as an Analyst/Data Scientist
Expert SQL Knowledge
Proven aptitude for problem solving and experimenting (A/B tests)
Collaborating across cross-functional teams
Proven aptitude for analysis of data and problem solving
A degree in STEM, Economics, or similar
The ability to challenge us! We want people who can come in and shape the future of this business, not afraid to raise questions and help us improve
Insurance knowledge is a plus!


The Benefits

There’s all the serious (but important) stuff we call “core benefits” and a salary that reflects your experience, our pay policy and the market we’re in from your first day is a global approach. However, some of our “core benefits” differ from the UK to the US to keep us competitive.

These range from life cover, a cash plan and a stakeholder pension in the UK to medical, dental, vision, and prescription drug coverage, short and long term disability, life insurance coverage and participation in 401(k) plan with a 3% employer match in the US.

The Fun stuff!

We are really proud of our culture at SB and that reflects in how our benefits roll. Flexible benefits and working, plenty of training to help you develop your career and loads of clubs to get involved in from trivia nights, guest speakers, and charity drives keep us all well connected. And, the great thing is being remote hasn’t stopped us one bit.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Let’s kick things off with a quick intro. Jane is a team that’s all about fostering growth, spreading delight, and serving our healthcare community. We’re looking for people who are ready to jump in and join us as we simplify the lives of healthcare practitioners and patients every day.

At Jane, success means collaborating with your team, delivering an aligned result with efficiency and quality, communicating clearly and openly, and embracing continuous improvement. And guess what? Jane is a remote-first company, so every role, including this one, gives you the freedom to work from anywhere in Canada.

Your Role In Our Journey

Jane is looking for a Data Analyst who will be responsible for delivering consistent, meaningful insights across the company with a focus on supporting our Product and Marketing teams. You will have strong experience with SQL, dbt, Looker and preferably experience in a fast growing software company. We're looking for someone who thrives in a fast-paced environment, enjoys working with stakeholders to solve business problems, and is excited about working with data that drives business impact. You’ll have the opportunity to shape how Jane uses data to improve product adoption, customer retention, and marketing efficiency. At Jane, we value transparency, ownership, and a problem-solving mindset. If you’re excited about working with data to unlock business insights and help shape decision-making, this could be the perfect role for you.

Learn More About Us

We're founder-led, which means we live our values while maintaining a clear vision for the future. Our product enables the likes of physiotherapists, mental health counsellors, chiropractors, and other allied health practitioners to run their practices in a digital-first way through features such as online booking, charting, scheduling, telehealth, secure payments and billing along with an evolving library of features. You can see more of them here .

We're a company that is growing rapidly, and with that comes the challenge of navigating an environment with many moving parts, often without a clear-cut path laid out in front of us. If you're the kind of person who gets a kick out of being resourceful and loves solving problems, we would love to hear from you.

No doubt, Jane's a special place to work. There is autonomy and flexibility to help integrate work into your life in a way that makes sense for you. Need to block out time to pick up the kids? Go for it. That's normal here. And yes, we have a Slack channel for parents, but we've also got channels dedicated to plants, furry friends, food, pride, wellness - you get the idea! While we love to connect virtually, the Jane team also connects in person throughout the year.

We believe in collaboration, humility, and keeping a growth mindset. We're looking for people who can embrace our way of working, which often means being flexible and open to change. So, if after reading this, you feel excited about the opportunity — all in the name of helping those who help others — reach out to us to learn more.

You can also learn more about Jane as a company and a product by checking out our Glassdoor reviews and our Capterra Reviews

If you're excited by our growth, ready to contribute to a challenging yet rewarding environment, and eager to be a disruptor alongside a team of talented individuals, we’d love to hear from you!

Develop and optimize Looker dashboards to surface insights and track business performance.

Familiarity with different data architectures (e.g., star vs snowflake schema)


Compensation Expectations For The Role

Jane’s committed to paying our team members fairly, clearly, and above all, paying for growth. This role has a minimum annual salary of $75,200 and maximum annual salary of $112,800. As you may have noticed, this salary range is quite large, and this is intentional to account for the growth someone will experience in the role throughout their time at Jane (i.e., from building the skills, to accomplished, to highly proficient, all the way to achieving excellence in the role). When hiring talented folks to join the Jane team, we’ve found that new team members are best set up for success when hired with the expectation of being fully accomplished in the role, which for this role would reflect a starting salary of $89,300.

It's also possible to join Jane at a salary above or below this, which would mean a salary below $89,300 typically reflects someone who has all the potential to be fully accomplished in the role but doesn't yet possess all the skills required, while a salary above $89,300 is typically for individuals who are currently in this role at Jane and had the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on our customers, product and company with deep Jane knowledge. At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.

Paying clearly is one of our compensation fundamentals to help folks build trust in the compensation process at Jane. To better understand Jane’s compensation fundamentals and how this range is determined, click on this link here for a short video walkthrough of how it all works! We also welcome you to ask as many questions as you’d like about compensation throughout the interview process to ensure you feel confident and build trust through the process.

More information on our benefits can be found here !

At Jane, we’re committed to fostering an environment that allows you to come to work as your truest self. We believe it’s important to actively recognize, embrace, and celebrate our differences in order to make Jane an inclusive, equitable, and diverse workplace.

We want to build a team of people who make conversations rich with perspective and experience. We are committed to listening to every voice in order to learn and grow because doing this will allow us to meet the needs of the diverse community of helpers that Jane serves.

We do not tolerate discrimination, prejudice, or oppressive isms of any kind. Employment is decided on the basis of qualifications, merit, experience, and the needs of the Jane community. We encourage anyone who requires accommodation or adjustments throughout the interview process to let us know, and we will do our best to support you.

To do this, we start with our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization.

Data is at the heart of Lyft’s products and decision-making. You will leverage data and rigorous, analytical thinking to shape our products and make business decisions. This will involve performing rigorous product deep dives, identifying opportunities for product enhancements, and measuring the impact of new features.

The Verticals team encompasses 3 critical and unique products / marketplaces within Lyft: airports, scheduled rides, and events. Airports are one of the most important, impactful, and complex parts of Lyft’s Rideshare business, as they are a key part of both the rider and driver Lyft experience and have unique dynamics. Scheduled rides allow riders to book a ride in advance with high reliability, and enable drivers to add structure to their work schedule. Lastly, events such as concerts or sporting games require similar considerations of special operations to ensure a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.

As a Senior Data Analyst on the Verticals team, you will collaborate with engineering, product, design, operations, and marketing to think critically about the current rider and driver experience and implement product enhancements to facilitate market growth. The ideal candidate can apply strong business acumen to propose product and marketplace changes, and is comfortable working with a highly cross functional team. In this role, you will help us tackle problems such as:


Which airports are underperforming and which key metrics can we use to identify and classify airport performance? What targets should we set for these key metrics?
What is driving high cancellation rates today and which types of riders/drivers are cancelling? What product changes can we implement to reduce cancellation rates for scheduled rides?
How are riders and drivers using different ride modes at airports and events, and how do we design products to address this behavior?
How are riders and drivers discovering scheduled rides and are there entry point optimizations we can implement?


Responsibilities:


Leverage data and analytic frameworks to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency across Verticals products, recommending solutions to drive business impact
Understand the complex business dynamics across the Verticals product areas, specifically how these products differ from traditional rideshare marketplaces, to propose enhancements that compliment Lyft-wide products
Partner with product managers, engineers, marketers, designers, and operators to translate data insights into decisions and action
Develop dashboards and analytical frameworks to monitor business and product performance
Establish metrics that measure the health of our products, the business, as well as the rider and driver experiences


Experience:


5-7+ years of experience in data analytics in a high-growth environment
Degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, economics, applied math, operations research or engineering (an asset, advanced degrees also an asset)

So why — despite the huge leaps we've taken in design and usability — does most business phone software still look, feel, and act like it was born in the 90s? OpenPhone is changing that.

We’re a new type of business phone with a mission to help people communicate better and be more productive.

We’re backed by Y Combinator and some of the best venture firms around including Tiger Global, Craft Ventures, Slow Ventures, and others. We take pride in providing an exceptional customer experience and a product people love, which is why we’re excited that our customers have rated us the #1 VoIP Provider on G2.

OpenPhone is the modern, sophisticated answer to the clunky, outdated phone systems that have been slowing down businesses for years. With thousands of happy customers and several rounds of funding in just five years, it's safe to say we're onto something big.

About The Role

We are hiring a Data Analyst with 4+ years of experience to primarily support our Go-To-Market (GTM) teams by providing insights and reporting to drive strategic decision-making. The ideal candidate will have strong analytical skills, experience with SQL, BI reporting tools, and a passion for translating data into actionable business insights. Experience in SaaS environments and familiarity with key SaaS metrics is highly desirable.

Some Of The Things You’ll Do


Develop and maintain dashboards and reports using BI tools (e.g., Mode, Tableau) to support GTM teams.
Analyze marketing, advertising, and sales data, including conversion funnel and cohort retention analyses, slicing data by attribution models, and providing customer lifecycle insights.
Collaborate with stakeholders across sales, marketing, and customer success to define key metrics and reporting needs.
Write efficient SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data from various sources.
Assist in data modeling and transformation using dbt (a plus but not required).
Comfortable with working large and complex data coming from multiple sources such as Kafka events or web traffic data from ad platforms.
Communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Ensure data accuracy, integrity, and security in all reporting and analysis efforts.


About You


4+ years of experience in data analysis, preferably in a SaaS environment.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills with a quantitative mindset.
Familiarity with analytics engineering and dbt (a plus).
Excellent communication skills with the ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical audiences.
Ability to thrive in a high-paced, high-growth environment.
Experience managing data projects and collaborating with cross-functional teams.


Compensation

The annual base salary range for this position is as follows, plus equity and benefits:


SF Bay Area, Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Boston, New York, and Washington, DC Metro: $158,000 - $176,000 USD
All other US Locations: $141,000 - $156,000 USD
Canada: 160,000 - $178,000 CAD


The ranges displayed reflect the target for new hire salaries, and within each range, individual pay is determined by your skills and experience, as well as relevant education. Your recruiter can share more and answer questions about the specific salary range during the hiring process.

Salary is just one component of OpenPhone’s total compensation package. Your total rewards package will include equity, extensive medical coverage, a monthly lifestyle stipend, and a flexible PTO policy.

Who We Are

As a fully remote company, we thrive asynchronously as a team. We are curious, ambitious, and dedicated to our work. We value trust above all else, and have a strong bias for action. If you're looking for a place to do your life's work, please get in touch. We'd love to hear from you.

And remember, there's no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. We're looking for optimists with grit and determination, who are excited to face the challenges of a growing startup. OpenPhone is the type of company where you can grow, and we encourage you to apply for this role even if you don't think you meet all the requirements.

We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment. It is important that you are able to bring your authentic self to work every day. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Compensation Expectations For The Role

Jane’s committed to paying our team members fairly, clearly, and above all, paying for growth. This role has a minimum annual salary of $118,000 and maximum annual salary of $185,500. As you may have noticed, this salary range is quite large, and this is intentional to account for the growth someone will experience in the role throughout their time at Jane (i.e., from building the skills, to accomplished, to highly proficient, all the way to achieving excellence in the role). When hiring talented folks to join the Jane team, we’ve found that new team members are best set up for success when hired with the expectation of being accomplished in the role, which for this role would reflect a starting salary of $141,000.

It's also possible to join Jane at a salary above or below this, which would mean a salary below $141,000 typically reflects someone who has all the potential to be fully accomplished in the role but doesn't yet possess all the skills required, while a salary above $141,000 is typically for individuals who are currently in this role at Jane and had the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on our customers, product and company with deep Jane knowledge. At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.

Paying clearly is one of our compensation fundamentals to help folks build trust in the compensation process at Jane. To better understand Jane’s compensation fundamentals and how this range is determined, click on this link here for a short video walkthrough of how it all works! We also welcome you to ask as many questions as you’d like about compensation throughout the interview process to ensure you feel confident and build trust through the process.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together.

You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

At Trader Interactive, we make buying and selling a great experience. We’re a group of go-getters who decided they didn’t want to settle for the status quo. We come together as one team to build value and drive innovation across our industries - but we have fun while we do it and make sure our people are always our #1 priority.




When it comes to your career, we want to provide big opportunities to help you make a big impact. But for this to be possible, we strive to feel small. Small enough to quickly change tack, small enough to learn from different teams and small enough to connect authentically with leadership.




And one of the best parts? We give you the freedom to work from whatever working location works best for you and your lifestyle - yes, this means you can be 100% remote if you want to be!




What We Offer

Plenty of flexible leave options and employee benefits including up to 31 days of paid time off in your first year, continuing education with access to LinkedIn Learning, a full benefits package including medical, dental & vision, 401K with company match, and wellness program.




What You’ll Do




We’re looking for a Senior Data Analyst to join our team and drive insights that enhance our customers’ understanding of user behavior and the path to purchase. This individual will play a key role in analyzing marketplace data across multiple websites to inform data-driven media planning & marketing decisions for our partners.




Analyze user behavior to identify interests, predict actions, and map the path to purchase for RVs, motorcycles, boats, and commercial equipment
Develop and maintain dashboards and reports using tools like Tableau and Power BI to enable self-serve insights for sales teams
Work on sales attribution by combining cross-category sales data with on-site user shopping behavior to support the value of our partnerships
Leverage multiple data sources to create innovative visualizations that better depict user engagement and the customer journey
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to design the next generation of insights and analysis frameworks
Provide actionable recommendations to improve customer engagement and product performance throughout the purchase journey




What We’re Looking For




4+ years of experience in data analysis, ideally within the media or digital space
Proficiency in tools like Tableau, Power BI, and SQL
Strong analytical skills with experience in user behavior analysis and predictive modeling
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to present complex data in an easily understandable manner
Experience working with diverse data sets and creating compelling visualizations




Bonus Points:




Bachelor’s degree in Data Science, Analytics, Statistics, or a related field (or equivalent experience)
Basic coding skills in Python, R, or a similar language to support data preparation and advanced analysis




So come and join our team - because every role is a big role in our plans to go big.

Compose pipelines by writing SQL code to clean, combine, refine, and aggregate data into the insights the organization needs.
Collaborating on new datasets to ingest into our Snowflake data warehouse, working closely with data engineers on your team.
Not afraid of pushing code that supports tens of billions of dollars in daily transaction volume.

We are looking for someone with previous data analyst experience. Likely with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Physics or related field, but we also consider and highly value equivalent practical experience.

Required


Strong SQL knowledge and experience
Proven track record in data modeling, statistics, and analytics
Experience working with a broad range of stakeholders

Chainlink Labs is the primary contributing developer of Chainlink, the decentralized computing platform powering the verifiable web. Chainlink is the industry-standard platform for providing access to real-world data, offchain computation, and secure cross-chain interoperability across any blockchain. Chainlink Labs helps power verifiable applications for banking, DeFi, global trade, and gaming by collaborating with some of the world’s largest financial institutions, notably Swift, DTCC, and ANZ. Chainlink Labs also works with top Web3 teams, including Aave, Compound, GMX, Maker, and Synthetix. Chainlink Labs was ranked in Newsweek’s 100 Most Loved Workplaces 2023 in both the United States and United Kingdom.

Chainlink Labs is pioneering the world’s first fully sustainable and decentralized oracle network, and the Economics team is searching for a Senior Analyst to play a critical role in building it. This role will sit at the intersection of blockchain technology, financial innovation, and economic systems, and shape the future of decentralized economics.

As a Senior Analyst, you will combine economics, data science, and blockchain expertise to shape incentives, optimize network design, and influence the decision-making of our Economics and Executive Leadership teams.

Designing novel mechanisms and incentive schemes
Building models and simulations to evaluate investment opportunities
Designing and parameterizing trading systems
Optimizing parameters for production applications
Contributing to the design of Economics programs and applications
You'll optimize network incentives and systems by engaging directly with the Economics, Product, Engineering, Research, and Data Science teams to understand network dynamics at the deepest level.
You'll operationalize processes and analytics systems, and coordinate cross-functionally to implement them.
This is both a highly technical and highly social role. You will have high visibility and a large impact on how Chainlink builds the world’s first fully sustainable decentralized oracle network.

Requirements


5+ years experience in a quantitative role, particularly trading or quant research
A deep understanding of financial and crypto markets and incentives
Extensive financial modeling background, including data engineering and model automation
Strong SQL and Python skills are mandatory
Experience solving economic problems through statistical/econometric analyses
Substantial data analysis and/or data science experience
