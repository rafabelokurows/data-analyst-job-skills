Design clear, automated reports to democratise data access to the whole company
Work in a cross functional team, mostly focusing on the business insights generation in collaboration with colleagues of Marketing, Finance and Sales departments

We want to innovate the financial services offered by commercial/retail banks in Italy in the areas of wealth management, credit lending, risk management and compliance. Building on our consolidated expertise and product offering in the Capital Markets domain, we want to scale our solutions and frameworks to the commercial/retail banking industry. To do so, we start from the quantitative modelling and analysis of the current processes put in place by our customers, so that we can profile opportunities of automation and prioritize client needs on manual/painful workflows. The resource will be involved in business process analyses of Italian commercial/retail financial institutions and is expected to integrate structured information extracted from interviews with the analysis of literature and documentation to build a quantitative picture of the AS-IS. The analysis will then be complemented with a consequent implementation analysis and product roadmap definition to design the TO-BE and drive product evolutions and developments. The project entails modelling complex business contexts, extracting structured information from unstructured sources, performing quantitative analyses, presenting findings and recommendations to external clients and internal stakeholders, contributing to the definition of product backlogs.

What You Will Learn During Your Intern


Quantitative modelling of business processes
Codification of customer requirements, needs, activities

We want to innovate the financial services offered by commercial/retail banks in Italy in the areas of wealth management, credit lending, risk management and compliance. Building on our consolidated expertise and product offering in the Capital Markets domain, we want to scale our solutions and frameworks to the commercial/retail banking industry. To do so, we start from the quantitative modelling and analysis of the current processes put in place by our customers, so that we can profile opportunities of automation and prioritize client needs on manual/painful workflows. The resource will be involved in business process analyses of Italian commercial/retail financial institutions and is expected to integrate structured information extracted from interviews with the analysis of literature and documentation to build a quantitative picture of the AS-IS. The analysis will then be complemented with a consequent implementation analysis and product roadmap definition to design the TO-BE and drive product evolutions and developments. The project entails modelling complex business contexts, extracting structured information from unstructured sources, performing quantitative analyses, presenting findings and recommendations to external clients and internal stakeholders, contributing to the definition of product backlogs.

What You Will Learn During Your Intern

Register your interest today, and you’ll be among the first we consider when recruitment begins.




At Bending Spoons, we’re striving to build one of the all-time great companies. A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.




To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.




For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.




A few examples of your responsibilities

Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.




What we look for

Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.




What we offer

Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of €52,246. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.




Commitment & contract

Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time.




Location

Milan (Italy) or fully remote.




Before you apply

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We’re extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don’t hesitate to apply.




The selection process

We welcome applications in English and Italian. If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.




Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested at accommodations-ext@bendingspoons.com.




Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

Nossa História

“As crianças são o futuro. Se a gente quiser modificar alguma coisa, é pelas crianças que devemos começar, pela sua educação”, Ayrton Senna.

Nosso tricampeão de Fórmula 1 sonhava com um Brasil justo, onde todas as crianças e jovens tivessem a mesma OPORTUNIDADE que ele teve durante sua vida. Oportunidade de ter uma educação de qualidade e, portanto, direito à esperança e à chance de um futuro digno.

Foi com esse desejo que nasceu, em 1994, o INSTITUTO AYRTON SENNA, uma organização sem fins lucrativos que prepara crianças e jovens brasileiros para enfrentar os desafios do século 21.
