Partner with Supply Chain customers to understand difficulties and dashboard gaps, implement enhancements and custom tools, and continuously test and refine solutions for greater impact.
Lead data projects from end to end — capture partner requirements, identify and source relevant data, build the initial version, and iterate through feedback cycles to deliver a refined, production-ready solution.
Contribute to projects, proactively identify and raise potential opportunities or commonalities, and apply critical thinking to drive continuous improvement across the business.


What You’ll Need


A bachelor's degree or equivalent experience in information technology, engineering, statistics, computer science, business with analytics focus!

About The Job

Despite being used over one billion times per day, YouTube Search has only been recently explored from a data science perspective. There is quite a bit of unexplored territory where we can define foundational concepts with large scale impact and leverage.

In this role, you will be the first go-to analyst to work on Search Verticals. Search Verticals is a full-stack area, and you will leverage your skills across multiple core competencies, such as ML classifier development, ranking, and experiments, to understand and optimize the YouTube Search Vertical experience.

At YouTube, we believe that everyone deserves to have a voice, and that the world is a better place when we listen, share, and build community through our stories. We work together to give everyone the power to share their story, explore what they love, and connect with one another in the process. Working at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and boundless creativity, we move at the speed of culture with a shared goal to show people the world. We explore new ideas, solve real problems, and have fun — and we do it all together.

The US base salary range for this full-time position is $141,000-$202,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. Within the range, individual pay is determined by work location and additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your preferred location during the hiring process.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Payment Intelligence Engineering’s purpose is to mitigate threats to our systems in order to keep our merchants, Stripe and financial partners safe. We empower global businesses with intelligent solutions for conversion and fraud prevention, leveraging consumer intelligence and transparent ML to maximize growth and build trust. Our Payments Intelligence portfolio delivers actionable insights to all user segments.

The Payments Health Technical Operations team is pioneering new ways to achieve this mission. Our dynamic team relies on the expertise of integration reliability engineers and data analysts to identify gaps and build comprehensive solutions in the ever changing arena of fraud prevention.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and maintain SQL queries to analyze and navigate complex financial data effectively.
Enhance overall observability by identifying gaps and proposing actionable insights to improve our monitoring systems.
Actively hunt for patterns and anomalies in data that could indicate potential threats or operational issues.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to consolidate and gather relevant data for informed engineering efforts.
Design and implement comprehensive dashboards for real-time visibility into key metrics and system health.
Establish and refine key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress and improvements over time.
Support the creation and maintenance of observability frameworks to ensure early detection of issues.
Contribute to efforts that reduce organizational toil by optimizing data analysis processes.
Communicate findings and insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Stay updated with industry trends in data analysis and financial data handling to ensure best practices.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have 5+ years of experience in Payments at a leading technology or payments company
Have experience writing SQL to query relational databases
Have experience managing communications and workflows with technical and non-technical teams across internal and external stakeholders
Experience mentoring junior team members in technical skill development, operational strategy and problem solving
Have experience navigating the nuanced complexity of financial systems and solving large scale, technical challenges
Have strong financial modeling and analytical skills to investigate, prioritize, and identify the root cause of issues
Have experience managing multiple, concurrent work streams, identifying and triaging technical issues and driving solutions with clear metrics to show impact



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,400 - $219,600. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.

Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.

We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense. We have offices located in the SoHo neighborhood of New York, the Mission District in San Francisco, and Lawrenceville in Pittsburgh.

The Role

Our generative AI-powered products are revolutionizing the practice of medicine, and we’re looking for a highly motivated Senior Data Analyst to join our growing US-based Data Science & BI team. Your work will be instrumental in driving product strategy, directly influencing how healthcare professionals engage with patient data.

What You'll Do

Data Analysis and Insight Generation


Extract meaningful insights and identify trends and patterns relevant to our business and product, by collecting, cleaning, and analyzing internal and external data
Ensure end-to-end visibility and understanding of our AI generation pipelines, from internal quality metrics to automated assessment in production.
Investigate and correct issues identified through data operations monitors, tools, and reports.


Cross-Functional Leadership and Collaboration


Effectively communicate trends and patterns to internal and external stakeholders, by developing and maintaining live dashboards
Serve as a domain expert for the business context of our analytics data, sharing your understanding of the assumptions and limitations of our business metrics.
Continually enhance our understanding of the business and product, by identifying and filling gaps in our data sources. This includes working closely with multidisciplinary teams such as product, engineering, partner success, and the executive team.


Who You Are


8+ years of experience in Data Analytics, BI or a related field, ideally at a product-focused software company.
Expert-level SQL skills with proficiency in writing efficient queries on large and complex data sets.
Understanding of database technology and experience with a cloud SQL data warehouse (e.g. BigQuery, Postgres, Snowflake)
Experience in analytical data modeling and schema design
Experience with a data visualization tool (e.g. Tableau, Looker, Sigma)


Data Advocate


Excellent communicator capable of effectively delivering quantitative findings to non-technical stakeholders in a clear and compelling fashion.
A team player, comfortable assisting others across the organization in solving data problems and answering questions with data
Passionate about data quality, with a keen interest in data drill down and problem-solving
Ability to prioritize amidst changing priorities in a fast moving environment


Domain-relevant Knowledge


Knowledge of healthcare settings, electronic health records (EHR), and healthcare billing are all a plus
Experience with common approaches to measure and drive user engagement is a plus


Base Salary: $153,000 USD - $189,000 USD per year + Equity

The salary range provided is based on transparent pay guidelines and is an estimate for candidates residing in the San Francisco Bay area. The actual base salary will vary depending on the candidate's location, relevant experience, skills, qualifications, and other job-related factors. Additionally, this role may include the opportunity to participate in a company stock option plan as part of the total compensation package.

Must be willing to work from our SF office at least 3x per week

This position requires a commitment to a hybrid work model, with the expectation of coming into the office a minimum of (3) three times per week. Relocation assistance is available for candidates willing to move to San Francisco.

We value people who are eager to learn new things and recognize that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.

Why work at Abridge?

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

How we take care of Abridgers:


Generous Time Off: 13 paid holidays, flexible PTO for salaried employees, and accrued time off for hourly employees.
Comprehensive Health Plans: Medical, Dental, and Vision plans for all full-time employees. Abridge covers 100% of the premium for you and 75% for dependents. If you choose a HSA-eligible plan, Abridge also makes monthly contributions to your HSA.
Paid Parental Leave: 16 weeks paid parental leave for all full-time employees.
401k and Matching: Contribution matching to help invest in your future.
Pre-tax Benefits: Access to Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) and Commuter Benefits.
Learning and Development Budget: Yearly contributions for coaching, courses, workshops, conferences, and more.
Sabbatical Leave: 30 days of paid Sabbatical Leave after 5 years of employment.
Compensation and Equity: Competitive compensation and equity grants for full time employees.
... and much more!


Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying safe - Protect yourself from recruitment fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article. Please exercise caution and cease communications if something feels suspicious about your interactions.

Compensation Range: $153K - $189K

Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities. In fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.

Our vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we're creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality. Homeward supports Medicare-eligible beneficiaries by partnering with health plans, providers, and communities to align incentives – taking full financial accountability for clinical outcomes and the total cost of care across rural counties.

As a public benefit corporation and Certified B Corp™, Homeward's mission and business model are aligned to address the healthcare, economic, and demographic challenges that make it challenging for rural Americans to stay healthy. Our Homeward Navigation™ platform uses advanced analytics to connect members to the right care and local resources that address social determinants of health and improve holistic health outcomes. Since many rural communities lack adequate clinical capacity, Homeward also employs care teams that supplement local practices and reach people who cannot otherwise access care.

Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo's products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding. With this leadership team and funding, Homeward is committed to bringing high-quality healthcare to rural communities in need.

The Opportunity

Join us in tackling healthcare for rural America! We're seeking a Senior Data Analyst who is passionate about having a positive societal impact and using technology for good – solving issues of health inequity for communities that have been perennially underserved. As a Senior Data Analyst, you'll join our Data Analytics and Data Science team as a strong ""all-arounder"" in the analytics space. You will leverage your proven track record for success in healthcare analytics to take ownership of business intelligence, member engagement, and operational reporting and complete ad-hoc analyses to support various functions across the business.

What you'll do:


Identify needs and deliver analytic products – from formal business intelligence products to ad-hoc analytics
Develop, mature, and deliver our business intelligence strategy across the enterprise, across growth, clinical delivery, quality, and cost results for internal and external audiences
Collaborate with stakeholders to identify highest-priority analytic questions, analyze relevant data, and generate actionable insights that enable improvement
Develop systems and processes to use our data effectively, accurately, and efficiently across the enterprise
Collaborate with our Technology team to deliver requirements on the highest priority data sources and most appropriate structures for analytics
Standardize and transform data into data structures that support operational reporting


What you bring:


3+ years of experience in data analysis and/or business intelligence development
Demonstrated orientation toward ensuring data quality and accuracy on a case-by-case basis and at scale
Strong technical skills necessary to perform advanced analytics: coding ( SQL, Python, R) and experience with data management (dbt) and visualization tools (Tableau, Metabase, Looker)
Collaborative spirit and ability to drive analyses with technical and non-technical stakeholders
Ability to zoom in with attention to detail and also zoom out to see the big picture
Strong communicator of questions, challenges, opportunities, and results to technical and non-technical audiences


Bonus Points:


Expertise in Medicare data including claims, EHR data, provider data, HEDIS, Star Ratings, risk adjustment as well as value-based care analytics
Experience with the TUVA Project
Experience with marketing measurement, attribution, forecasting, capacity management, and experimental test design and evaluation
Experience building and consolidating longitudinal data from multiple sources
Experience with QA validation and automation tools
Previous experience building from the ground up on a small, fast-paced team


What shapes our company:


Deep commitment to one another, the people and communities we serve, and to care that enables everyone to achieve their best health
Compassion and empathy
Curiosity, and an eagerness to listen
Drive to deliver high-quality experiences, clinical care, and cost-effectiveness
Strong focus on sustainability of our business and scalability of our services, to maximize our reach and impact
Nurturing a diverse workforce, with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and points of view
Taking our mission and business seriously, but not taking ourselves too seriously– having fun as we build!


Benefits:


Competitive salary, equity grant, generous paid time off
Comprehensive benefits package including medical, dental & vision insurance with 100% of monthly premium covered for employees
Company-sponsored 401k plan
Flexible working arrangement


The base salary range for this position is $140,000 - $165,000 annually. Compensation may vary outside of this range depending on a number of factors, including a candidate's qualifications, skills, location, competencies and experience. Base pay is one part of the total compensation package that is provided to compensate and recognize employees for their work at Homeward Health. This role is eligible for an annual bonus, stock options, as well as a comprehensive benefits package.

At Homeward, a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences enrich our teams and allow us to achieve above and beyond our goals.

Homeward supports Medicare-eligible beneficiaries by partnering with health plans, providers, and communities to align incentives – taking full financial accountability for clinical outcomes and the total cost of care across rural counties.<br><br>As a public benefit corporation and Certified B Corp™, Homeward's mission and business model are aligned to address the healthcare, economic, and demographic challenges that make it challenging for rural Americans to stay healthy. Our Homeward Navigation™ platform uses advanced analytics to connect members to the right care and local resources that address social determinants of health and improve holistic health outcomes. Since many rural communities lack adequate clinical capacity, Homeward also employs care teams that supplement local practices and reach people who cannot otherwise access care.<br><br>Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo's products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding. With this leadership team and funding, Homeward is committed to bringing high-quality healthcare to rural communities in need.<br><br><strong>The Opportunity<br><br></strong>Join us in tackling healthcare for rural America!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

The role

As part of our mission to scale end-to-end embodied AI for autonomous driving, we are building a world-class Data Management team focused on unlocking high-quality, targeted data acquisition that drives model performance and predictability. We are looking for a highly analytical and systems-minded ODD & Behavioral Competency Analyst to lead the analysis of Operational Design Domains (ODDs), traffic patterns, and regulatory behaviors across our target markets.

This role will be critical in defining what data is needed, where, and how much, in order to build models with high Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and generalization capabilities across varied geographies.

Key Responsibilities


Analyze and define the operational design domain (ODD) for each target market or region, including geography, infrastructure, weather, road types, traffic density, and local driving behaviors.
Identify ODD boundaries, edge conditions, and failure triggers to inform data collection and system design.
Build and maintain a taxonomy of behavioral competencies (e.g., merging, yielding, unprotected turns, interacting with pedestrians) required to safely operate in each ODD.
Quantify the complexity and frequency of each competency based on local traffic data, regulations, and real-world observations.
Develop a framework to compute and prioritize permutations of ODD parameters and behavioral competencies to optimize data collection, scenario coverage, and scaling efficiency.
Recommend minimal data slices needed to support safe and predictable system performance in a new region.
Analyze traffic laws, enforcement patterns, and common driving behaviors in new markets to assess differences in required system behavior and edge case risks.
Collaborate with legal and safety teams to map regulations to system-level behavioral expectations.
Work closely with data engineering, safety, simulation, product, and deployment teams to turn ODD and competency insights into actionable data strategies and deployment plans.
Provide input to scenario library development, synthetic data generation, and test case prioritization.
Use historical data and statistical models to identify data gaps or high-variance behaviors that impact MTBF performance.
Provide guidance on what additional data is needed to reach MTBF targets in each ODD segment.


About You

In order to set you up for success as a Data Analyst at Wayve, we’re looking for the following skills and experience.

Essential


Strong background in systems engineering, transportation analysis, data science, or a related field.
Proven experience with traffic system modeling, autonomous driving deployment, or urban mobility analysis.
Experience analyzing or defining ODDs in the context of AV/ADAS technologies is a strong plus.
Familiarity with traffic regulations and human driving behaviors across multiple geographies.
Proficiency in data analysis tools (e.g., Python, SQL, GIS, Jupyter) and ability to visualize ODD and scenario coverage metrics.
Ability to work cross-functionally and translate domain analysis into technical and product requirements.
Experience working in an agile, fast-scaling environment with a strong execution mindset.


This is a full-time role based in our office in Sunnvale. At Wayve we want the best of all worlds so we operate a hybrid working policy that combines time together in our offices and workshops to fuel innovation, culture, relationships and learning, and time spent working from home. We operate core working hours so you can determine the schedule that works best for you and your team.

We understand that everyone has a unique set of skills and experiences and that not everyone will meet all of the requirements listed above. If you’re passionate about self-driving cars and think you have what it takes to make a positive impact on the world, we encourage you to apply.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our team is a part of Strategy & Analytics (S&A), which maximizes and accelerates Operations' ability to make Stripe work for our users. We work cross-functionally with global teams to help run the day-to-day business, taking a data-driven approach that combines strategy and analytics to help Ops leaders solve their most complex and most important issues while also driving the business planning and operational cadence end-to-end, from strategy to goal-setting to execution.

What you’ll do

We are seeking a Data Analyst to drive and enable business performance in Ops’ Strategy & Analytics team. In this role, you will be a critical partner in driving data-driven decision making across Stripe Operations. You'll work closely with cross-functional, technical stakeholders to identify and address their most impactful challenges using data and analyses. You'll own the development and implementation of experiments, key metrics, ML models, and data pipelines, ensuring the foundational systems in Stripe Operations are robust, high-quality, and reliable. You'll work hand-in-hand with partner teams in Data Science, Product, and Engineering to implement data-driven solutions that optimize our processes and tools. Acting as a technical expert and bridge between the Strategy and Analytics team and our operational partners, you'll champion the use of data to inform high-impact projects and initiatives.

If you are incessantly curious, eager to solve big data challenges, relentless, passionate about helping users, and interested in diving into a quickly-growing team and company, we want to hear from you.

Partner with Operations and Engineering teams on the implementation of high impact data projects, championing data driven decision making

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles
Mastery of SQL and a strong understanding of data relationships / relational databases, experience working with large datasets.
Proficiency in Scala, Python, or another programming language
Strong statistical knowledge
Proven skills in A/B testing, experiment set-up, and analysis

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $182,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

- 0-2 years of data analysis

- Degree in Computer Science (preferably within a data centric area)

- SQL

- Python

- Great communication and presentation skills




Nice to Have Skills & Experience

- Tableau

- DataBricks

- Call center background




Job Description

- Our client is looking to build a team of Data Scientists to support real-time transcription of their high-volume contact centers based virtually and throughout the United States.

- The team currently has Speech Analysts, and they are looking to expand their capabilities to provide real-time text data transcription and sentiment analysis, and use AI instead of audio.

- The goal is to develop AI models with transcripts to capture call summaries in two to three sentences about the issue and resolution, and gather sentiment feedback based on tone, energy, and language.

- Currently, they have natural language processing (NLP) in place and need to improve LLMs for GenAI. They’re not wanting the creation of a chatbot or repository, but more so candidates who understand what is going on behind the screen and fine tuning the existing model.

- The LLMs are text data specific and they need to incorporate more word embedding to convert word phrases to numerical representation of words using different techniques to identify similarities and allow the computer to understand those meanings.

- The goal is to build their own ChatGPT which will involve transcript and phonetic based queries converting that to transcript-based queries.




- This role will be responsible for:

o Performs data collection, analysis, validation and reporting.

o Designs, tests, and documents processes, SQL queries, and stored procedures.

o Support some manual labeling of data

o Build out dashboards

o Extracts and analyzes data from various sources, including databases, manual files, and external websites.

o Responds to data inquiries from various groups within an organization.

o Creates and publishes regularly scheduled and ad hoc reports.

Location: Hybrid – Belfast or Central London (EC4N)

The role

We are seeking an ambitious individual with a professional and proactive approach to join our Market Intelligence team.

In collaboration with our consulting team, the Market Intelligence Unit empowers our clients to navigate the market landscape with confidence. We provide insights on both a macro level and through in-depth competitor and market analysis. Your role will involve creating and maintaining innovative data tools that are essential for both internal and external use. You’ll handle large datasets gathered from both online sources and traditional research methods, ensuring their consistency and integrity.

Beyond data management, you’ll have the opportunity to present your findings in impactful ways, making a real difference in our clients’ strategic decisions.

Although the primary focus of this role is data management, we are a growing business. There is potential for advancement within the Market Intelligence Unit, allowing you to assume greater responsibilities over time.

Candidate requirements

Our team has a broad range of backgrounds and interests but everyone is an outperformer, always striving to be the best. They have shown this in their careers to date by doing something exceptional or thinking about things differently.

We do not want robots and we certainly don’t want egos. We are a small team where everyone is expected to support each other. There is no need or tolerance for sharp elbows.

We like people who thrive in uncertainty and see it as an opportunity. We like people who think creatively and commercially, always thinking about how we can enhance our market position. At interview, we like hearing about the knocks people have taken and how they’ve bounced back – because overcoming adversity is a critical skill for a high-growth challenger consultancy with a big vision.

We are looking for candidates with the following qualifications and experience:


A degree from a reputable university
Experience building excel models and managing data
Experience of financial analysis and research
Strong data analysis and data visualisation capabilities – experience in using PowerBI or similar tools ideal
Prior experience within the non-life insurance sector is advantageous but not essential
Willingness to travel to London if based in Belfast
Strong personal and professional motivation

- 0-2 years of data analysis

- Degree in Computer Science (preferably within a data centric area)

- SQL

- Python

- Great communication and presentation skills




Nice to Have Skills & Experience

- Tableau

- DataBricks

- Call center background




Job Description

- Our client is looking to build a team of Data Scientists to support real-time transcription of their high-volume contact centers based virtually and throughout the United States.

- The team currently has Speech Analysts, and they are looking to expand their capabilities to provide real-time text data transcription and sentiment analysis, and use AI instead of audio.

- The goal is to develop AI models with transcripts to capture call summaries in two to three sentences about the issue and resolution, and gather sentiment feedback based on tone, energy, and language.

- Currently, they have natural language processing (NLP) in place and need to improve LLMs for GenAI. They’re not wanting the creation of a chatbot or repository, but more so candidates who understand what is going on behind the screen and fine tuning the existing model.

- The LLMs are text data specific and they need to incorporate more word embedding to convert word phrases to numerical representation of words using different techniques to identify similarities and allow the computer to understand those meanings.

- The goal is to build their own ChatGPT which will involve transcript and phonetic based queries converting that to transcript-based queries.




- This role will be responsible for:

o Performs data collection, analysis, validation and reporting.

o Designs, tests, and documents processes, SQL queries, and stored procedures.

o Support some manual labeling of data

o Build out dashboards

o Extracts and analyzes data from various sources, including databases, manual files, and external websites.

o Responds to data inquiries from various groups within an organization.

o Creates and publishes regularly scheduled and ad hoc reports.

Location: Hybrid – Belfast or Central London (EC4N)

The role

We are seeking an ambitious individual with a professional and proactive approach to join our Market Intelligence team.

In collaboration with our consulting team, the Market Intelligence Unit empowers our clients to navigate the market landscape with confidence. We provide insights on both a macro level and through in-depth competitor and market analysis. Your role will involve creating and maintaining innovative data tools that are essential for both internal and external use. You’ll handle large datasets gathered from both online sources and traditional research methods, ensuring their consistency and integrity.

Beyond data management, you’ll have the opportunity to present your findings in impactful ways, making a real difference in our clients’ strategic decisions.

Although the primary focus of this role is data management, we are a growing business. There is potential for advancement within the Market Intelligence Unit, allowing you to assume greater responsibilities over time.

Candidate requirements

Our team has a broad range of backgrounds and interests but everyone is an outperformer, always striving to be the best. They have shown this in their careers to date by doing something exceptional or thinking about things differently.

We do not want robots and we certainly don’t want egos. We are a small team where everyone is expected to support each other. There is no need or tolerance for sharp elbows.

We like people who thrive in uncertainty and see it as an opportunity. We like people who think creatively and commercially, always thinking about how we can enhance our market position. At interview, we like hearing about the knocks people have taken and how they’ve bounced back – because overcoming adversity is a critical skill for a high-growth challenger consultancy with a big vision.

We are looking for candidates with the following qualifications and experience:


A degree from a reputable university
Experience building excel models and managing data
Experience of financial analysis and research
Strong data analysis and data visualisation capabilities – experience in using PowerBI or similar tools ideal
Prior experience within the non-life insurance sector is advantageous but not essential
Willingness to travel to London if based in Belfast
Strong personal and professional motivation

Location: In-Office | Highpoint – 14100 58th St N, Clearwater, FL 33760

Schedule: Full-time, Monday–Friday |

Exempt/Salaried




Data that drives change. Work that matters.




At Evara Health, we believe that access to quality healthcare should never be limited by circumstance. As a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) with 18 locations throughout Pinellas County, we serve more than 75,000 patients annually, offering comprehensive care including Primary Care, Dental, Pediatrics, Behavioral Health, and more.




As we grow, so does our need for strategic, data-driven decision-making. That’s why we’re looking for a Data Analyst who can transform raw numbers into powerful insights that directly impact patient outcomes, organizational strategy, and community health.




If you want to do work that matters—and be part of a mission-driven culture that truly values its people—this is your opportunity.







Why this role matters

As a Data Analyst on the Evara Health team, you’ll build dashboards and reports that directly support clinical outcomes, population health, performance tracking, and grant and regulatory reporting. You’ll work closely with clinical, operational, and executive leaders to turn raw data into meaningful insights—helping drive decisions that improve care for thousands of patients.




If you're an experienced analyst with strong healthcare experience, deep technical skills in SQL and Power BI, and the ability to collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders—you’ll thrive here.







What you’ll do

Build dashboards and dynamic reports: Develop and maintain visualizations using Power BI and SQL across clinical, operational, and financial datasets.
Work with clinical and healthcare data: Extract and analyze EHR (Epic) data to support clinical program performance, grant tracking, and population health management.
Collaborate cross-functionally: Partner with leaders, clinicians, and administrators to understand data needs, present insights, and build tailored solutions that drive action.
Ensure data accuracy and integrity: Conduct data validation, troubleshoot discrepancies, and uphold reporting standards across multiple systems.
Deliver timely and accurate reporting: Produce recurring and ad hoc reports for leadership, grant partners, and external stakeholders that are aligned with regulatory and strategic goals.
Support compliance and risk management: Assist with data for audits, risk reviews, and compliance tracking—ensuring reporting meets federal, state, and internal requirements.







You’re a strong candidate if you...

Have 3–5 years of hands-on experience building dashboards and reports using Power BI and SQL
Have direct experience working with clinical data in a healthcare setting (hospital, health system, FQHC, or provider group strongly preferred)
Have a working knowledge of Epic (or similar EHR platforms)
Understand how to interpret and present data to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Possess strong business acumen and communication skills—you know how to ask the right questions and deliver clear, actionable insights
Are proactive, curious, and detail-oriented, with a passion for solving problems that make a real-world impact
Hold a degree in Data Science, Computer Science, Healthcare Informatics, or a related field; data analytics certifications (e.g., Power BI, Google, Tableau) are a plus







Total Rewards That Go Beyond the Basics

At Evara Health, we believe great people make great organizations. That’s why we offer one of the most generous and unique benefits packages in our industry:

36 days of paid time off to start (25 PTO, 10 holidays, 1 birthday)
Quarterly performance-based bonus payouts
4% employer contributions to your retirement—no match required
90% employer-paid healthcare premiums
Up to $1,000/year in HSA contributions
Free or discounted healthcare at Evara Health facilities
Free gym memberships and public transportation access (PTSA)
$1,500/year in education assistance for certifications, training, or formal education
A mission-driven workplace with record-breaking engagement scores and a supportive, innovative culture







Ready to turn healthcare data into life-changing outcomes?




At Evara Health, this isn’t just a data role. It’s a chance to work with purpose—translating insights into action, and action into impact.




Apply today and join a team driven by purpose and powered by people.

Ensure data quality and consistency by implementing data validation and governance frameworks.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams, including survey engineers and operations teams, to provide actionable insights.
Automate data workflows using Power Query, Python, and SQL to optimize reporting processes.
Support predictive analytics and machine learning initiatives to improve survey forecasting and vessel performance.




Requirements: Essential Skills / Attributes and Experience

2-5 years of experience as a Data Analyst or similar role.
Strong proficiency in Power BI, SQL,Grafana ( or similar tools) and Python for data processing and automation.
Experience working with large datasets from marine, geospatial, or operational data sources.
Knowledge of data governance, quality control, and reporting best practices.

Pearl Health is powering the future of healthcare. We help primary care providers and organizations to deliver quality healthcare to the patients who need it most, when they need it most — and get rewarded for keeping patients healthy.

Our technology, services, and financial tools enable better, more proactive care, decrease total cost of care across patient panels, and optimize performance in value-based care models for Traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage.

We are a team of physicians and public health experts (Stanford, Harvard, Mount Sinai), technologists (athenahealth, Amazon, Meta, Flatiron), healthcare innovators (Centivo, Aledade, Stellar, Arcadia), and experienced risk management professionals (CVS/Aetna, Humana, Oscar) who believe that primary care providers are the key to addressing our healthcare system’s biggest challenges.

Since its founding in 2020, Pearl has expanded to partner with thousands of primary care providers in practices and organizations across 44 states. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Viking Global Investors, AlleyCorp, and SV Angel.

What We Hope You Can Do...

As a Staff Data Analyst at Pearl, you'll be instrumental in building robust data analytics infrastructure and driving data-informed decisions that impact our clinical outcomes and P&L. You will tackle challenging problems related to practice engagement, patient spend insights, network analytics, collaborating with Data Science, Product, Engineering, and Customer Success teams to identify opportunities, build robust analytical solutions, and develop and maintain KPIs that offer actionable insights to the organization. This role provides an opportunity to leverage your analytical and architectural expertise to make a tangible impact on healthcare. You'll have the opportunity to mentor other data analysts as well as have a leadership role on key projects.

What Staff Data Analyst means to us...


Translate the company’s goals and vision into its strategy and operations by surfacing insights from quantitative analyses in business intelligence systems (Mode and Hex).
Own the design, development, and maintenance of data pipelines in Snowflake & dbt, with a strong emphasis on data quality standards and data accuracy across various data sources, working with a high degree of autonomy in addition to support from your manager and Engineering.
Establish and champion best-in-class data architectures, encompassing schema design, data ontologies, governance processes, and optimization strategies (query and computer fine tuning) to ensure scalable, reliable, and well-governed data assets.
Manage ambiguity while working with cross-functional teams on complex projects, with a focus on defining data requirements, developing analytical models, and interpreting results.
Partner with Data Engineering and Product to create end-to-end data pipelines that turn raw data into actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.
Contribute to the development of the data analytics roadmap and strategy by collaborating with leadership in the Data Science and Analytics organization to identify opportunities and propose technical and business-level solutions with a medium-term (1-2 year) time horizon.
Evaluate new data technologies and tools (including data warehouses, orchestration systems, and BI tools) to enhance the team's capabilities.
Mentor other data analysts, providing guidance on analytical techniques and best practices.
Help your manager establish standards, design guidelines, and SOPs for analytical workflows, e.g., dashboard development, EDA, and ingestion of new datasets.


Who You Are...


Bachelor's or Master's degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Economics, or related field).
8+ years of experience in delivering business analytics across the data pipeline: data ingestion, data architecture/schema design (including dimensional modeling), data transformation, data analysis, and reporting data to business stakeholders (including data visualization)
Strong experience building end-to-end data pipelines for business stakeholders, direct experience using Snowflake, PySpark, and DBT preferred
Demonstrated ability to design data schemas that maximize dataset utility by analyzing input data, understanding business and technical needs, and structuring staging tables, functional data marts, or conceptual data marts to capture ontological relationships.
Expert proficiency in SQL and Python for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
Excellent communication, presentation, and facilitation skills, with the ability to explain complex concepts clearly and concisely.
Experience in specifying cloud architecture using Terraform is a plus.
