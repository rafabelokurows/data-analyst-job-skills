Hi, I’m Tobias, Director of Data Analytics at WebPros, and your future manager. With nearly 20 years of experience in the hosting industry as a developer and BI analyst, I joined WebPros over seven years ago as a data scientist. Throughout my time at WebPros, I initially contributed as a developer and later transitioned into a leadership role, helping to create a comprehensive reporting infrastructure that serves the entire organization.

This role is all about impact. We are looking for a Data Analyst to help us derive actionable insights and enhance data-driven decision-making. If you love autonomy, problem-solving, and working in an async-first, globally distributed team, this is an exciting opportunity to shape the future of our data analytics infrastructure.

You’ll thrive in this role if you’re comfortable navigating data landscapes, driving projects independently, and collaborating across teams to translate business needs into suitable reports and dashboards. If you’re excited about solving reporting challenges with SQL, Looker, and cloud technologies, you’ll find a great home here.

Below, you’ll find everything you need to decide if this role is right for you. From our culture and work style to the specifics of the position and hiring process. We believe in transparency, so we’ve put in the effort to give you a real, inside look at what it’s like to work here.

About WebPros

WebPros is committed to empowering businesses worldwide through cutting-edge solutions in web hosting, billing automation, infrastructure, server management, and online marketing. Since our founding in 2017, we’ve rapidly grown into a global leader, expanding our robust portfolio to include industry-defining brands such as cPanel & WHM, Plesk, WHMCS, SolusVM, NIXStats, XOVI, SocialBee, and Sitejet.

Today, we power 85 million+ websites across 900,000+ servers worldwide, backed by a 600+ strong team of dedicated professionals spanning multiple continents. At WebPros, we embrace a fully remote, borderless workplace with a focus on flexibility, autonomy, and work-life balance. Whether you prefer working from a bustling city hub or a quiet home office, we enable our teams to thrive from anywhere while staying deeply connected through our strong collaborative culture.

Your Role

We are looking for a remote Data Analyst to help design, build, and optimize our reporting infrastructure. You will work with Google BigQuery, SQL, Looker Studio and similar reporting tools to develop interactive and insightful dashboards, build data models, and deliver data-driven insights.

Your Impact In The First 180 Days

We don’t believe in endless checklists of requirements. Instead, here’s what success looks like in your first 6 months:


30 Days: Get fully onboarded and familiarize yourself with our data infrastructure. Connect with stakeholders across teams to understand potential data needs and identify opportunities for improving current reporting, while also recognizing efficient practices.
60 Days: Deploy your first production-ready updates. Collaborate with the members of the analytics and engineering teams to experiment with dashboard optimizations that enhance reliability and incorporate best practices.
120 Days: You are ready to deploy new dashboards, which involves collaborating with business users, stakeholders, and data source owners. Additionally, you are familiar with the data infrastructure across the organisation and ready to understand the reporting needs of the business.
After 180 Days: You have become an invaluable member of the data analytics team. You have made a significant impact by introducing solutions that enhance the efficiency of dashboards and reporting and improve data quality and monitoring capabilities.


By this point, you won’t just be executing tasks. You’ll be making strategic contributions, improving how we report and share data across the organization, and positioning yourself as a key player in our Data & AI team.

You’ll Thrive Here If You


Have strong experience in dashboarding and reporting, general data analytics, SQL, along with experience in cloud providers such as Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure.
Can independently apply these skills to real-world challenges.
Take ownership of projects from concept to deployment, proactively solving problems and driving impact.
Enjoy working in an async-first, globally distributed team that values autonomy and deep work.
Excel in fast-paced environments where cross-functional collaboration is key to success.


You Might Struggle Here If You


Prefer highly structured roles with rigid processes and step-by-step workflows.
Find it challenging to navigate ambiguity or adapt to changing priorities.
Require constant guidance rather than taking initiative and driving your own work.
Are seeking an entry-level position with extensive hands-on mentorship.


How We Work


Team & Workflow: Fully remote, async-first team (CET timezone). We follow an Agile-inspired Scrumban workflow, minimizing meetings (~10-20% of the workweek) and prioritizing deep work.
Collaboration & Ownership: Self-managed work with a strong emphasis on accountability, autonomy, and decision-making.
Tech Stack & Tools: Google BigQuery, Looker Studio.
Cloud & Infrastructure: Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Testing & Quality: Shift-left approach, high test coverage.
Releases & CI/CD: Fully automated CI/CD, daily releases, no strict release cycles.


Our Culture

WebPros is built on diversity, not just in principle but by design. We’ve grown through acquiring industry-leading brands, bringing together teams from 42+ nationalities, 20+ countries, and 10+ brands. Instead of enforcing a one-size-fits-all culture, we embrace unique perspectives, different working styles, and localized expertise to drive global innovation.

We are a fully remote, async-friendly company where transparency, open communication, and collaborative problem-solving define how we work. Whether you thrive in the fast pace of a startup or the stability of an established product, WebPros offers a dynamic, evolving career journey that you can shape based on your strengths.

We are committed to fostering an inclusive, equitable workplace where every team member feels valued, heard, and supported because our diversity is our strength.

Compensation & Benefits

We believe benefits go beyond just perks. At WebPros, we invest in your growth, flexibility, and well-being, so you can do your best work and build a meaningful career. While we strive to provide equal global benefits for all team members, some may vary by location, and we’ll clarify the details with you during the interview process.


Competitive salary
Remote-first flexibility: Work from anywhere in Europe (or hybrid in available offices).
Development Budget: Annual personal growth allowance.
Learning Support: Udemy subscription & peer learning.
Public Transport & Meal Vouchers: Location-dependent benefits.
Paid Time Off: The number of days of annual leave is dependent on your location.
Team Culture: Regular team and on-site company events.


Your Hiring Experience

Hi, I’m Florian, your Talent Partner for EMEA at WebPros. I’ll guide you through the interview process, ensuring a clear, transparent, and meaningful experience. Before moving into talent and culture, I was a software engineer, so I understand what it’s like to navigate technical hiring. My goal is to make this process a genuine, two-way conversation where you feel informed, valued, and empowered to make the best decision for your career.

Hiring is about relationships, not just resumes. You can expect honest, constructive feedback at every step, and I welcome yours as well. No matter the outcome, I want this to be a positive and insightful experience. If you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn.

Interview Process


Screening Interview (30 min): A conversation with Florian to get to know each other, and introduce you to WebPros, our culture, and your potential team. We’ll discuss your motivation, career aspirations, and how your experience aligns with the role while giving you as much insight as possible into what to expect.
Hiring Manager Interview (45 min): Discussion with Tobias to assess team fit, self-reliance, technical alignment, and problem-solving skills.
Technical & Culture Interview (60 min): Deep dive into technical expertise, problem-solving, adaptability, and data handling, followed by a cultural fit discussion with two team members.
Offer Talk (30 min): Final conversation with Tobias and Florian to review offer details and answer any remaining questions.


Our Commitment to a Diverse & Inclusive Culture

At WebPros, we want every team member to feel excited to bring their full, authentic self to work. Our strength lies in the diversity of our people, with different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences driving innovation and making us stronger together.

We are committed to ensuring equitable opportunities, pay, and support for all employees, regardless of identity, background, or circumstances. We foster a culture of belonging, respect, and psychological safety, where everyone feels valued, heard, and empowered to contribute meaningfully and grow.

Discrimination of any kind, including sexism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and ageism, has no place here. By embracing differences and championing inclusivity, we create an environment where everyone can thrive.

We are looking forward to your application!

Best,

Tobias & Florian

Hi, I’m Tobias, Director of Data Analytics at WebPros, and your future manager. With nearly 20 years of experience in the hosting industry as a developer and BI analyst, I joined WebPros over seven years ago as a data scientist. Throughout my time at WebPros, I initially contributed as a developer and later transitioned into a leadership role, helping to create a comprehensive reporting infrastructure that serves the entire organization.

This role is all about impact. We are looking for a Data Analyst to help us derive actionable insights and enhance data-driven decision-making. If you love autonomy, problem-solving, and working in an async-first, globally distributed team, this is an exciting opportunity to shape the future of our data analytics infrastructure.

You’ll thrive in this role if you’re comfortable navigating data landscapes, driving projects independently, and collaborating across teams to translate business needs into suitable reports and dashboards. If you’re excited about solving reporting challenges with SQL, Looker, and cloud technologies, you’ll find a great home here.

Below, you’ll find everything you need to decide if this role is right for you. From our culture and work style to the specifics of the position and hiring process. We believe in transparency, so we’ve put in the effort to give you a real, inside look at what it’s like to work here.

About WebPros

WebPros is committed to empowering businesses worldwide through cutting-edge solutions in web hosting, billing automation, infrastructure, server management, and online marketing. Since our founding in 2017, we’ve rapidly grown into a global leader, expanding our robust portfolio to include industry-defining brands such as cPanel & WHM, Plesk, WHMCS, SolusVM, NIXStats, XOVI, SocialBee, and Sitejet.

Today, we power 85 million+ websites across 900,000+ servers worldwide, backed by a 600+ strong team of dedicated professionals spanning multiple continents. At WebPros, we embrace a fully remote, borderless workplace with a focus on flexibility, autonomy, and work-life balance. Whether you prefer working from a bustling city hub or a quiet home office, we enable our teams to thrive from anywhere while staying deeply connected through our strong collaborative culture.

Your Role

We are looking for a remote Data Analyst to help design, build, and optimize our reporting infrastructure. You will work with Google BigQuery, SQL, Looker Studio and similar reporting tools to develop interactive and insightful dashboards, build data models, and deliver data-driven insights.

Your Impact In The First 180 Days

We don’t believe in endless checklists of requirements. Instead, here’s what success looks like in your first 6 months:


30 Days: Get fully onboarded and familiarize yourself with our data infrastructure. Connect with stakeholders across teams to understand potential data needs and identify opportunities for improving current reporting, while also recognizing efficient practices.
60 Days: Deploy your first production-ready updates. Collaborate with the members of the analytics and engineering teams to experiment with dashboard optimizations that enhance reliability and incorporate best practices.
120 Days: You are ready to deploy new dashboards, which involves collaborating with business users, stakeholders, and data source owners. Additionally, you are familiar with the data infrastructure across the organisation and ready to understand the reporting needs of the business.
After 180 Days: You have become an invaluable member of the data analytics team. You have made a significant impact by introducing solutions that enhance the efficiency of dashboards and reporting and improve data quality and monitoring capabilities.


By this point, you won’t just be executing tasks. You’ll be making strategic contributions, improving how we report and share data across the organization, and positioning yourself as a key player in our Data & AI team.

You’ll Thrive Here If You


Have strong experience in dashboarding and reporting, general data analytics, SQL, along with experience in cloud providers such as Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure.
Can independently apply these skills to real-world challenges.
Take ownership of projects from concept to deployment, proactively solving problems and driving impact.
Enjoy working in an async-first, globally distributed team that values autonomy and deep work.
Excel in fast-paced environments where cross-functional collaboration is key to success.


You Might Struggle Here If You


Prefer highly structured roles with rigid processes and step-by-step workflows.
Find it challenging to navigate ambiguity or adapt to changing priorities.
Require constant guidance rather than taking initiative and driving your own work.
Are seeking an entry-level position with extensive hands-on mentorship.


How We Work


Team & Workflow: Fully remote, async-first team (CET timezone). We follow an Agile-inspired Scrumban workflow, minimizing meetings (~10-20% of the workweek) and prioritizing deep work.
Collaboration & Ownership: Self-managed work with a strong emphasis on accountability, autonomy, and decision-making.
Tech Stack & Tools: Google BigQuery, Looker Studio.
Cloud & Infrastructure: Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Testing & Quality: Shift-left approach, high test coverage.
Releases & CI/CD: Fully automated CI/CD, daily releases, no strict release cycles.


Our Culture

WebPros is built on diversity, not just in principle but by design. We’ve grown through acquiring industry-leading brands, bringing together teams from 42+ nationalities, 20+ countries, and 10+ brands. Instead of enforcing a one-size-fits-all culture, we embrace unique perspectives, different working styles, and localized expertise to drive global innovation.

We are a fully remote, async-friendly company where transparency, open communication, and collaborative problem-solving define how we work. Whether you thrive in the fast pace of a startup or the stability of an established product, WebPros offers a dynamic, evolving career journey that you can shape based on your strengths.

We are committed to fostering an inclusive, equitable workplace where every team member feels valued, heard, and supported because our diversity is our strength.

Compensation & Benefits

We believe benefits go beyond just perks. At WebPros, we invest in your growth, flexibility, and well-being, so you can do your best work and build a meaningful career. While we strive to provide equal global benefits for all team members, some may vary by location, and we’ll clarify the details with you during the interview process.


Competitive salary
Remote-first flexibility: Work from anywhere in Europe (or hybrid in available offices).
Development Budget: Annual personal growth allowance.
Learning Support: Udemy subscription & peer learning.
Public Transport & Meal Vouchers: Location-dependent benefits.
Paid Time Off: The number of days of annual leave is dependent on your location.
Team Culture: Regular team and on-site company events.


Your Hiring Experience

Hi, I’m Florian, your Talent Partner for EMEA at WebPros. I’ll guide you through the interview process, ensuring a clear, transparent, and meaningful experience. Before moving into talent and culture, I was a software engineer, so I understand what it’s like to navigate technical hiring. My goal is to make this process a genuine, two-way conversation where you feel informed, valued, and empowered to make the best decision for your career.

Hiring is about relationships, not just resumes. You can expect honest, constructive feedback at every step, and I welcome yours as well. No matter the outcome, I want this to be a positive and insightful experience. If you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn.

Interview Process


Screening Interview (30 min): A conversation with Florian to get to know each other, and introduce you to WebPros, our culture, and your potential team. We’ll discuss your motivation, career aspirations, and how your experience aligns with the role while giving you as much insight as possible into what to expect.
Hiring Manager Interview (45 min): Discussion with Tobias to assess team fit, self-reliance, technical alignment, and problem-solving skills.
Technical & Culture Interview (60 min): Deep dive into technical expertise, problem-solving, adaptability, and data handling, followed by a cultural fit discussion with two team members.
Offer Talk (30 min): Final conversation with Tobias and Florian to review offer details and answer any remaining questions.


Our Commitment to a Diverse & Inclusive Culture

At WebPros, we want every team member to feel excited to bring their full, authentic self to work. Our strength lies in the diversity of our people, with different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences driving innovation and making us stronger together.

We are committed to ensuring equitable opportunities, pay, and support for all employees, regardless of identity, background, or circumstances. We foster a culture of belonging, respect, and psychological safety, where everyone feels valued, heard, and empowered to contribute meaningfully and grow.

Discrimination of any kind, including sexism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and ageism, has no place here. By embracing differences and championing inclusivity, we create an environment where everyone can thrive.

We are looking forward to your application!

Best,

Tobias & Florian

We recognise that AI function tools (i.e. ChatGPT or other generative AI tools) are here to stay and can be helpful for applications e.g. to assist in researching for application responses and to shorten your first draft. However, we are observing a growing trend in the use of AI, and we would caution applicants against relying too heavily on such tools when drafting responses.

The pitfall of such tools is that they produce generic responses that don't showcase individuality, specific experiences or real-life examples. This usually results in applications being unsuccessful. We want to evaluate your response, and we will be looking for answers that use examples and experiences that are clearly specific to you. You are more likely to successfully demonstrate your soft skills like communication and teamwork when preparing answers to application questions yourself and this helps mitigate the unintended consequences of AI-generated responses.

If we suspect you have used AI inappropriately, the panel reviewing your application may adjust how your response is rated. For more details of what we consider to be acceptable use of AI function tools in our application process, please review our FAQs on our careers page.

We are committed to the safeguarding of children and the most vulnerable in our society and, as such, we are unable to employ individuals with relevant convictions, including the following: a conviction for an offence involving violence or dishonesty, of a sexual nature or against minors, or for any other offence that is relevant to the nature of the services provided by our organisation.

For any questions or queries please review our FAQs | Ambition Institute Careers (pinpointhq.com) in the first instance. If we've not addressed your question in this section, please email us at jobs@ambition.org.uk

As an employer, we have a responsibility to prevent illegal working in the UK by ensuring that our employees have the right to work in the UK. Therefore, as part of the recruitment process to verify your eligibility you will be required to produce relevant documentation.

However, we are observing a growing trend in the use of AI, and we would caution applicants against relying too heavily on such tools when drafting responses. <br><br>The pitfall of such tools is that they produce generic responses that don't showcase individuality, specific experiences or real-life examples. This usually results in applications being unsuccessful. We want to evaluate your response, and we will be looking for answers that use examples and experiences that are clearly specific to you. You are more likely to successfully demonstrate your soft skills like communication and teamwork when preparing answers to application questions yourself and this helps mitigate the unintended consequences of AI-generated responses.<br><br>If we suspect you have used AI inappropriately, the panel reviewing your application may adjust how your response is rated. For more details of what we consider to be acceptable use of AI function tools in our application process, please review our FAQs on our careers page.<br><br>We are committed to the safeguarding of children and the most vulnerable in our society and, as such, we are unable to employ individuals with relevant convictions, including the following: a conviction for an offence involving violence or dishonesty, of a sexual nature or against minors, or for any other offence that is relevant to the nature of the services provided by our organisation.<br><br>For any questions or queries please review our FAQs | Ambition Institute Careers (pinpointhq.com) in the first instance.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.
