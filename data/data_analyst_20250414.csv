About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Payment Intelligence Engineering’s purpose is to mitigate threats to our systems in order to keep our merchants, Stripe and financial partners safe. We empower global businesses with intelligent solutions for conversion and fraud prevention, leveraging consumer intelligence and transparent ML to maximize growth and build trust. Our Payments Intelligence portfolio delivers actionable insights to all user segments.

The Payments Health Technical Operations team is pioneering new ways to achieve this mission. Our dynamic team relies on the expertise of integration reliability engineers and data analysts to identify gaps and build comprehensive solutions in the ever changing arena of fraud prevention.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and maintain SQL queries to analyze and navigate complex financial data effectively.
Enhance overall observability by identifying gaps and proposing actionable insights to improve our monitoring systems.
Actively hunt for patterns and anomalies in data that could indicate potential threats or operational issues.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to consolidate and gather relevant data for informed engineering efforts.
Design and implement comprehensive dashboards for real-time visibility into key metrics and system health.
Establish and refine key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress and improvements over time.
Support the creation and maintenance of observability frameworks to ensure early detection of issues.
Contribute to efforts that reduce organizational toil by optimizing data analysis processes.
Communicate findings and insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Stay updated with industry trends in data analysis and financial data handling to ensure best practices.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have 5+ years of experience in Payments at a leading technology or payments company
Have experience writing SQL to query relational databases
Have experience managing communications and workflows with technical and non-technical teams across internal and external stakeholders
Experience mentoring junior team members in technical skill development, operational strategy and problem solving
Have experience navigating the nuanced complexity of financial systems and solving large scale, technical challenges
Have strong financial modeling and analytical skills to investigate, prioritize, and identify the root cause of issues
Have experience managing multiple, concurrent work streams, identifying and triaging technical issues and driving solutions with clear metrics to show impact



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,400 - $219,600. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Departmental Overview

UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business offers a unique opportunity to champion new ideas, collaborate across boundaries, and continually learn in a workplace committed to increasing diversity and creating a welcoming environment for all. Our distinctive culture is captured within our four Defining Leadership Principles: Question the Status Quo, Confidence Without Attitude, Students Always, and Beyond Yourself. These principles distinguish Berkeley Haas as a unique environment conducive to teamwork, collaboration, and career growth.

This position will work with a Professor in the Haas School of Business on a specific research project, one designed to study whether “high road” worker- owned companies can create high-quality jobs and improve productivity despite the fact that the low market share of these organizational forms suggest that the benefits may not usually arise or that market imperfections may impede their growth. This study therefore looks at worker-owned companies in California and will explore whether public policies could cost-effectively promote them. The study will focus particularly on whether worker ownership fits well with the needs of workers from historically disadvantaged groups.

Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.

Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.

We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense. We have offices located in the SoHo neighborhood of New York, the Mission District in San Francisco, and Lawrenceville in Pittsburgh.

The Role

Our generative AI-powered products are revolutionizing the practice of medicine, and we’re looking for a highly motivated Senior Data Analyst to join our growing US-based Data Science & BI team. Your work will be instrumental in driving product strategy, directly influencing how healthcare professionals engage with patient data.

What You'll Do

Data Analysis and Insight Generation


Extract meaningful insights and identify trends and patterns relevant to our business and product, by collecting, cleaning, and analyzing internal and external data
Ensure end-to-end visibility and understanding of our AI generation pipelines, from internal quality metrics to automated assessment in production.
Investigate and correct issues identified through data operations monitors, tools, and reports.


Cross-Functional Leadership and Collaboration


Effectively communicate trends and patterns to internal and external stakeholders, by developing and maintaining live dashboards
Serve as a domain expert for the business context of our analytics data, sharing your understanding of the assumptions and limitations of our business metrics.
Continually enhance our understanding of the business and product, by identifying and filling gaps in our data sources. This includes working closely with multidisciplinary teams such as product, engineering, partner success, and the executive team.


Who You Are


8+ years of experience in Data Analytics, BI or a related field, ideally at a product-focused software company.
Expert-level SQL skills with proficiency in writing efficient queries on large and complex data sets.
Understanding of database technology and experience with a cloud SQL data warehouse (e.g. BigQuery, Postgres, Snowflake)
Experience in analytical data modeling and schema design
Experience with a data visualization tool (e.g. Tableau, Looker, Sigma)


Data Advocate


Excellent communicator capable of effectively delivering quantitative findings to non-technical stakeholders in a clear and compelling fashion.
A team player, comfortable assisting others across the organization in solving data problems and answering questions with data
Passionate about data quality, with a keen interest in data drill down and problem-solving
Ability to prioritize amidst changing priorities in a fast moving environment


Domain-relevant Knowledge


Knowledge of healthcare settings, electronic health records (EHR), and healthcare billing are all a plus
Experience with common approaches to measure and drive user engagement is a plus


Base Salary: $153,000 USD - $189,000 USD per year + Equity

The salary range provided is based on transparent pay guidelines and is an estimate for candidates residing in the San Francisco Bay area. The actual base salary will vary depending on the candidate's location, relevant experience, skills, qualifications, and other job-related factors. Additionally, this role may include the opportunity to participate in a company stock option plan as part of the total compensation package.

Must be willing to work from our SF office at least 3x per week

This position requires a commitment to a hybrid work model, with the expectation of coming into the office a minimum of (3) three times per week. Relocation assistance is available for candidates willing to move to San Francisco.

We value people who are eager to learn new things and recognize that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.

Why work at Abridge?

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

How we take care of Abridgers:


Generous Time Off: 13 paid holidays, flexible PTO for salaried employees, and accrued time off for hourly employees.
Comprehensive Health Plans: Medical, Dental, and Vision plans for all full-time employees. Abridge covers 100% of the premium for you and 75% for dependents. If you choose a HSA-eligible plan, Abridge also makes monthly contributions to your HSA.
Paid Parental Leave: 16 weeks paid parental leave for all full-time employees.
401k and Matching: Contribution matching to help invest in your future.
Pre-tax Benefits: Access to Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) and Commuter Benefits.
Learning and Development Budget: Yearly contributions for coaching, courses, workshops, conferences, and more.
Sabbatical Leave: 30 days of paid Sabbatical Leave after 5 years of employment.
Compensation and Equity: Competitive compensation and equity grants for full time employees.
... and much more!


Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying safe - Protect yourself from recruitment fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article.

Mentor other data analysts, providing guidance on analytical techniques and best practices.
Help your manager establish standards, design guidelines, and SOPs for analytical workflows, e.g., dashboard development, EDA, and ingestion of new datasets.

Evaluate new data technologies and tools (including data warehouses, orchestration systems, and BI tools) to enhance the team's capabilities.
Mentor other data analysts, providing guidance on analytical techniques and best practices.
Help your manager establish standards, design guidelines, and SOPs for analytical workflows, e.g., dashboard development, EDA, and ingestion of new datasets.
