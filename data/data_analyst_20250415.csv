Our mission is providing better opportunities to invest in capital markets. By empowering FinTechs and Banks to offer investment products, we help create financial well-being for their customers. In pursuit of this goal, we strive to open 100 million securities accounts within Europe in this decade.

lemon.markets builds infrastructure for financial services and technology companies powering the next generation of investment products. From enabling a Fintech to launch their first investment product, over allowing e.g. a Neobank to embed investing into their product to bringing investing into a completely new context. Our API-first infrastructure makes launching an investment product customer-centric and compliant. We abstract all complexity for our partners through a well documented API, a self-service customer operations portal and operating in a clear regulatory framework. Enabling partners to launch in weeks, not months.

We have experienced first hand that brokerage infrastructure is broken. Building an investment product used to be highly expensive, challenging and cumbersome. We ease this pain by shielding our partners & their customers from the underlying complexity - and with that, we make investing more accessible to everyone. Because that‚Äôs exactly what we enjoy, going to places nobody else dares and solving hard problems. This not only creates tons of value when done right, but attracts the smartest minds - because outlier companies are built by exceptional (& diverse) people like you.

Your Mission:

As a Data Engineer at lemon.markets you will play a key role in designing and maintaining the end to end pipeline of data transmission. You will be the responsible and accountable person for the Data Warehouse ensuring Correctness, Availability, Performance and Security of the data.

You will be part of the Operations Tooling (OT) domain in lemon.markets. The OT domain powered by Retool facilitates all the operational day-to-day work arising from our brokerage platform comprising Customer Lifecycle, Order Lifecycle and Post Trade domains. In a nutshell, Retool is the GUI for data powered by DWH to facilitate Customer, Securities and Cash Operations. Apart from operational work, Retool is also the basis for doing analytics for various activities that our brokerage platform performs. From customer onboarding to order placement and cash and securities settlements.

Our Tech Stack is Python, Airbyte, Redshift, DBT, AWS, Temporal, Retool and Postgres. While you could have worked in different modern tech stacks prior, you should be excited to work with these tools and learn them if you haven‚Äôt worked with them before.

You will have a significant impact on the development and maintenance of our core platform & systems - and thereby architectural decisions, as well as on the business itself. You are the first point of contact for internal functions regarding day-to-day functionality of dashboards and can reliably solve issues in a professional manner.

Work alongside a cross-functional team of experts, and together we will leverage your previous experiences to build the investment infrastructure for the next 100 million retail investors in Europe.

About you:


You have the ability to write well-structured and tested code in more than one high-level programming languages like Python, Scala or Java, plus another language such as Javascript.
You have knowledge of data warehouse architectures (e.g., Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery).
You have a track record of designing, building and operating reliable and scalable ETL pipelines.
You‚Äôve gained good experience with software in a cloud environment (AWS, GCP, Azure) and the architectural patterns for this environment.
You have a good understanding of more than one document-based or relational database technology such as MySQL/PostgreSQL or MongoDB
You know how to write high-quality code that is understandable, maintainable and well tested, and can guide other engineers to do the same via code reviews.
You should be able to write high quality documentation catering to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
You have good problem-solving skills and the ability to provide in-depth evaluations and analyses of unique and complex technological issues.


You will be successful in this role if:


Growing investment opportunities excites you. We operate in a highly regulated environment and therefore having worked prior in a Fintech or financial Service provider would give you a head start, but is not a must.
You see yourself as a product engineer. That means, you are excited by solving customer problems and strive to become an expert in the domain area you are working in.
You enjoy building from scratch. This means high involvement in the product development process itself while advocating for the best engineering practices. It also means that you enjoy taking technical decisions.
You are ready and willing to take ownership of problems and act on them decisively with no supervision. You always thrive for high quality outcomes through focus, determination and attention to detail.
You are a team player. Working together as a team, sharing knowledge & providing mentorship comes naturally to you. Long term - you consider becoming a team lead.
You have no problem with learning new technologies on the go. You try to solve problems with more things than the ones you already know. We will always enable you with that, but your willingness has to come first.
You understand what working in a startup or a similar lean organisation is like. You are able to work with a small team in a lean environment, can move quickly and focus on what's truly important.


We're looking for people with passion, desire to learn and that are team players. You're encouraged to apply, even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out‚Äîand set you apart‚Äîespecially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns.

How we take care of you:

üöÄCompetitive compensation package:

We will offer you a mix of cash and stock options based on your appetite for upside.

üíéMake a real impact:

Shape the experience for our customers and us alike. Decide on tools, processes and the architecture design of our Platform & API, while building, learning and growing together.

üïëFlexible working hours:

We value focus time. Encouraging everyone to minimise fixed meetings and leverage asynchronous communication.

üíªBuild your perfect setup:

Mac/Linux, Mechanical Keyboard, Screen. These are not expenses but investments. Please tell us what is needed to make you productive, and we will take care of it.

üè¢ Hybrid work:

We all believe that in-person collaboration is an integral part of working together, but we offer flexibility to work from home across Europe. That means, lemoneers work 4 days or more per month on-site, spending quality time together with the team at events, offsites or over team dinners.

üìà Grow with us:

We take your personal development seriously, meaning that we make sure to constantly mentor and challenge you so that you can reach your next level and beyond.

üë∂üèΩ Get the flexibility you need:

Whether you have a family or a passion that you want to follow on the side. We want to offer you a setting that fits your current stage in life.

We're solving complex technical, operational and regulatory challenges to make connectivity truly effortless. We've grown to a team of around 90 people across the US and Europe, bringing together an experienced team of early-stage engineers, product builders and business athletes from companies like Stripe, Airbnb and Shopify.

At Briink, we're helping accelerate the transition to a sustainable future by creating the next-generation of AI powered tools for sustainability and ESG teams on the frontlines of solving the climate crisis.




We believe that AI is the key to unlocking the future of sustainable business. With over 50 enterprise clients‚Äîincluding some of the world's largest firms‚Äîwe‚Äôre already transforming how organizations manage their ESG data. Our technology helps sustainability teams uncover actionable insights from unstructured data sources, making it easier to drive compliance, efficiency, and impact at scale.




Backed by ‚Ç¨7 million in capital, including a freshly closed round, and supported by leading venture capital funds, Briink is at the forefront of ESG innovation. We‚Äôre based at the heart of Europe‚Äôs AI revolution‚Äîthe AI Campus in Berlin‚Äîwhere we are building a future where AI helps accelerate the transition to a sustainable future.


Your role


As Briink‚Äôs AI/LLM Engineer, you will work as part of the product and engineering team to bring the cutting edge of LLMs to sustainable finance and help advance Briink‚Äôs mission to accelerate transition to a sustainable planet. This includes both using your knowledge and experience as an AI practitioner to evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM engine, as well as exploring new use-cases for LLMs in ESG and sustainability.





Systematically evaluate and improve our core LLM systems: You will use your knowledge and experience as an AI/LLM practitioner to systematically evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM system and help ensure Briink becomes a world leader for ESG domain specific LLM tools.


Build LLMs into production grade services: On a scale with pure researcher on one side and traditional backend software development on the other side, this leans somewhat more on the software engineering side of the scale, as part of your role will also be to help ensure that improvements to the AI/LLM services are driven through to production and delivering tangible value to our users.


Explore new LLM use-cases in ESG: Both LLMs and ESG are moving very fast and so at Briink we value curiosity and exploring how AI could be applied to new use cases in ESG. Part of your role therefore will be to explore and prototype new ways LLMs could support our users and solve new problems for ESG teams.


Be a core member of the product and engineering team: Briink is a collaborative team and we really enjoy working together to try and build Briink into a successful company that has mission impact at scale. You will therefore work closely as part of a cross discipline team to make sure all the work we do pushes in the same direction and helps achieve our mission.



Your profile

What type of person we're looking for...



Knowledgable and experienced with building AI/LLM products: You have strong knowledge and experience of thinking through and building AI/LLM systems from prototyping and experiments through to deployment, evaluation, monitoring and improvement in production.


Practical Implementer: You are a ‚Äòbuilder‚Äô and aim to pragmatically integrate AI into real-world products, moving beyond research to create tangible, impactful solutions.


Personal agency and drive: must have personal agency, drive and ability to figure things out, learn and iterate to drive initiatives forward to success.


Innovative Thinker: You're driven by curiosity and continually experiment with new models, techniques and technologies in the rapidly evolving AI/LLM space.


Excellent Communicator: You have outstanding verbal and written communication skills in English, and can build strong relationships with internal teams and external partners.


Collaborative and Organised: You thrive in a dynamic, fast-paced environment, managing multiple projects while collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams to achieve success. Preferably with experience in start-ups.


Passion for ESG and Sustainability: You are motivated by using your skills to help address climate change and enthusiastic about building tools that help ESG and sustainability teams.



Technical Skills



Minimum of 4 years of experience: As an AI Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, AI/ML Product Engineer or related roles.


Fluency in python: Including strong proficiency with base python as well as modern frameworks (e.g. fastAPI)


Experience with LLMs: Including core concepts around foundation models, prompt engineering and chains etc. as well as preferably some experience with LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain). Experience using LLMs to build RAG systems and/or other real-world use-cases related to document processing would be a major bonus.


Experience with LLM evaluation: Including how to collect labelled data and systematically evaluate RAG and other real world LLM applications, preferably with experience in evaluation tools and frameworks (e.g. Langsmith)


Experience with production grade applications: Including familiarity with software development tools and practices for production applications (e.g git, CI/CD, containerization) and preferably some experience with cloud infrastructure and deployment (e.g. GCP, Modal). Any experience with cost/latency implications of deploying LLMs at scale would be a major bonus.


Fluency in English: With the ability to clearly communicate complex topics to diverse stakeholders. Any other European language would be a bonus.


Understanding or interest in sustainability: Including an interest in sustainability climate, or ESG topics and a desire to use your skills to help accelerate the climate transition.
Even if your experience doesn‚Äôt align precisely with all the criteria, we encourage you to apply. Many people miss out on opportunities because they feel they don‚Äôt fit every requirement‚Äîwe believe in growth, not perfection!



What we offer



Competitive Remuneration: As a core member of our team, you will receive a competitive salary and equity package, reflecting your role in shaping Briink‚Äôs future.


Purpose-Driven Mission: ESG data has the power to create a more sustainable world, but today it presents more challenges than solutions. We believe AI can change that. Be part of the transition to an AI-powered, sustainable world.


Flexible Working: Our work philosophy is built on flexibility. While we do like to come to the office (in Berlin or London) to collaborate in person, this is a hybrid role with opportunities for some remote work within European time zones.


Trust and Ownership: At Briink, we empower you to own your projects with the option for growing into new roles. We believe in giving people autonomy and trust to drive your own initiatives.


Dynamic Work Environment: Based at the Merantix AI Campus, Berlin‚Äôs hub for AI innovation, you‚Äôll work in a diverse, collaborative environment. With frequent events and opportunities for cross-company collaboration, you‚Äôll be part of a thriving ecosystem of AI startups and experts.


Learning budget and quarterly hackathons: We truly believe in the importance of curiosity and experimentation as both a learning opportunity and strategic advantage. We therefore have a learning budget to explore new technologies and regular hackathons to prototype new ideas.

Make an impact and meaningfully shape an early-stage company.
Experience a truly flat hierarchy and communicate directly with founding team members. Having an opinion and voicing your ideas is not only welcome but encouraged, especially when they challenge the status quo.
Learn from experienced mentors and achieve tremendous personal and professional growth. Get to know and leverage our network of leading tech investors and advisors around the globe.
Receive a top-of-market equity and cash compensation package.
Get access to a self-development budget you can use to e.g. attend conferences, buy books or take classes.

3. We work closely with the tech team, because we‚Äôre a tech company, so this how we solve customer problems, efficiently at scale


We work closely with our operations teams who are the people that speak directly to customers



What You'll Do


Take ownership of our management of customers who are struggling with their payments
Deep dive investigations into data in order to surface insight for decision making
Develop our reporting suite through the latest BI tools & technology stack
Develop our empathic approaches towards vulnerable customers
Create strategies to identify and prevent first party and third party fraud
Develop our machine learning models & policies that drive sophisticated decisions
Proactively identify new areas of opportunity
Challenge the status quo in terms of KPIs, objectives & strategy
Communicate complex data concepts effectively and confidently
Build great relationships with Data Science, Technology, Finance, Collections, Ops and other stakeholders



What You'll Need


Excellent SQL skills
A drive to solve problems using data



What would be a bonus:


Python data science stack (pandas, NumPy, Jupyter notebooks, Plotly/matplotlib, etc)
Familiarity with Git
Data visualization tool (Tableau, Looker, PowerBI or equivalent)
DBT
2-5 years experience of consumer credit risk or collections in the financial services, utilities or telecommunications industries

More in Common is seeking a full-time Research and Data Analyst as we grow our team and advance our mission of building a more united and inclusive UK, where all people feel respected, better understood, and share a sense of belonging. The Analyst will serve as a key member of the UK team, supporting our core areas of research, communications, partnership, and client work.

About More In Common

More in Common is a research agency working across the US, UK, Germany, France, Poland and Brazil to tackle polarisation and division. More in Common leads and supports initiatives to build more united, inclusive, and resilient societies. Our mission is to understand the forces driving us apart, help societies find common ground and bring people together to tackle shared challenges. In the UK, our work is best described as being part consultancy, part think tank. We provide a full suite of research services including polling and focus group research; evidence reviews and secondary data analysis; audience mapping and audience strategy; strategic communications strategy and campaign development. More in Common is a member of the British Polling Council.

Our work is informed by our ground-breaking segmentation of the British public. This unique values-based lens to our quantitative and qualitative research means we can understand not only what the public thinks on the big challenges facing British society today ‚Äì but crucially why they think it. Our insights help leaders in government, the media, business, and civil society to develop better strategies and communications ‚Äì particularly in reaching disengaged communities far from the Westminster/London bubble ‚Äì‚ÄØand to better navigate tricky and divisive issues.

Over the last year, More in Common has published agenda-setting thought leadership on a whole range of debates facing British society ‚Äì from exploring the public‚Äôs starting points on climate action and tackling crime and anti-social behaviour; to understanding how the British public is navigating major debates from trans and gender identity to the conflict in Israel and Palestine; to highlighting the public‚Äôs expectations on mental health reform and what‚Äôs next for the levelling up agenda. Our work is regularly covered in the British press and media and we‚Äôve developed a series of partnerships with broadcasters and newspapers to deliver top-quality research insights.

Through our consultancy, More in Common has also supported dozens of partners with insights and strategic communications support. We‚Äôve helped national institutions such as the BBC, British Library and National Trust to better understand and communicate with their audiences, we‚Äôve helped partners in government and civil society with the set-up and delivery of the Homes for Ukraine scheme, and we‚Äôve supported a range of partners to prepare campaigns, messaging and policy proposals from the National Farmers Union to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation among many others.

In 2025, More in Common has a range of exciting projects in the pipeline, including:


Refreshing our core values model with a deeper understanding of the attitudes and worldviews that shape the most important divides in Britain in 2025

We are looking for a Digital Analytics Associate Consultant to join our London-based consulting team. This is a varied role which spans across website architecture, UX analysis, media advisory and digital strategy. As a Consultant at 55, you will be working on marketing analytics and marketing activations as opposed to setting up and optimising campaigns, so we therefore are seeking applicants with some prior experience in marketing or web analytics.

Working as part of a small, collaborative team, you will play a key role in delivering fifty-five data-led projects to multiple, big brand clients across industries such as luxury, automotive, retail and beauty. These projects will be driven by client objectives relating to data collection, customer acquisition, onsite conversion optimisation and media-mix optimisation and you will be required to promote a customer-centric vision of digital marketing, based on the systematic and methodical use of data to support decisions.

You will report to a Project Lead and work alongside other Consultants, Tracking Specialists, Cloud Engineers and Innovation Experts. Led by the Senior Consultant, you will contribute to the timely & professional delivery of our projects. Examples of the sort of project work you will be part of delivering within the first year of your role include but are not limited to; the creation and monitoring of complex dashboards aimed at aggregating findings from numerous data sources; the evaluation of client's existing marketing channel mix and the recommendation of the most suitable attribution model; the implementation of cookie consent management solutions to obtain users consent for data collection, martech audience review and architecture recommendation. This is an exciting, hands-on role within a company that puts collaboration and knowledge sharing at the heart of everything we do.

Occasional travel possible, within the UK or abroad

If so, global change communications might be for you. We‚Äôre on the lookout for candidates who are interested in the world around them and are passionate about tackling global issues. At M+C Saatchi World Services we are focused on tackling some of humanity‚Äôs most challenging and important problems, in fragile states and developing countries, harnessing the power of cutting-edge communications and creativity to achieve long-term behaviour change.

The World Services Internship Programme is a paid 6-week scheme open to anyone looking to start a career in communications, with a focus on global change. It's a data boot camp designed for individuals passionate about the world of data science, data-driven insights and data analysis. Ideal for students or recent graduates, this programme offers the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in a dynamic and forward-thinking environment.

The internship will commence 21 July 2025 and run until 28 August 2025 based in our offices in Soho at regular business hours (9:30am ‚Äì 6:00pm). Interns will be expected to come into the office at least three times per week at the discretion of their programme leads.

M+C Saatchi World Services will consider scheme graduates for potential employment opportunities. While a job is not guaranteed, the purpose of this program is to invest in potential future talent.

About The Role

This role offers a unique opportunity to combine collaboration and learning.


You'll work closely with a senior data scientist, gaining mentorship, guidance, and feedback on your data analysis projects.
By actively participating in team meetings and project discussions, you'll contribute fresh perspectives and innovative ideas.
To further develop your technical skillset, you'll undergo comprehensive training in data analysis tools and techniques, including SQL, and dashboarding.
Finally, you'll master the art of data storytelling, preparing and presenting project reports that effectively communicate findings, methodologies, and results to both technical and non-technical audiences, ultimately impacting company decision-making.
You will be paid London Living Wage.



About You

We are looking for candidates who have:


Curious minds: We want someone who is naturally curious and fascinated by the world and why it is the way it is, particularly from a geo-political perspective. Someone who stops scrolling to read about what‚Äôs going on around the world and invests themselves in social issues. Someone who has a belief in the idea that communications, when applied properly, can lead to a better world.
A knack for collaborating: We work jointly with partners and agencies as well as other M&C Saatchi companies to provide support from strategy to implementation for many of our campaigns. We need a natural collaborator. Someone who empowers those around them and is open, willing and able to engage new people inside and outside of our organisation.
A desire for a meaningful career: What gets you out of bed in the morning? Those who are driven by a greater purpose and search for a ‚Äòwhy‚Äô in what they do will often find commercial careers unfulfilling. We are searching for the people who want their career to mean something.
Technical experience and programmatic ability: Candidates are expected to have the requisite skills to work within a data team. Knowledge of Python is essential, SQL desirable, and wider technical skills are welcomed. Familiarity with version control systems, especially Git, is strongly desirable. Candidates should be comfortable processing, understanding, and drawing insights from large datasets.



As we value curiosity and collaboration, we are looking for individuals who are naturally fascinated by the world and why it is the way it is, particularly from a data-driven perspective. A belief in the power of data and communications to improve the world is a must.

APPLICATION CLOSING DATE: Monday 05 May, 2025*

Successful candidates will be invited for a short video interview in mid-May 2025, or sooner, depending on application volume.

Please note: Internships are offered subject to the provision of a successful background check, and proof of right to work in the United Kingdom.


We reserve the right to close the application window earlier than stated if necessary.

We are currently looking for a Data Analytical Engineer to join our team, the role plays a crucial part in the management and transformation of data to support decision-making processes within our organisation.

Citylitics delivers predictive intelligence on local utility & public infrastructure markets

What is Infrastructure? It is the roadways you rely on to safely get to Grandma's house, it's the potable water that comes out of your kitchen tap that you wash your family's food with and it's the energy that heats our homes and powers our digital lifestyles.

Every year, trillions of dollars are spent on all areas of infrastructure to maintain our quality life and move our economy forward. However, our infrastructure is no longer equipped to meet the needs of the future. We hear about infrastructure failures, whether bridge collapses, power blackouts, or water main breaks, every day in the news. Climate change and extreme weather events are disrupting the basic infrastructure we took for granted for years.

Citylitics is solving the hardest data problems in infrastructure while building the sales intelligence platform that enables a faster, more transparent, and more efficient infrastructure marketplace. We turn millions of unstructured documents into high value intelligence feeds and datasets that are available on an intuitive user experience. Our goal is to enable solution providers to connect with cities with relevant infrastructure needs in a faster and more digital way than historic market channels. As more companies adopt our platform, cities & utilities will be able to access solutions that deliver on the promise of moving towards a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable infrastructure future.

Who Are We Looking For?

The Data Operations Specialist will be pivotal in ensuring the efficiency and reliability of our data services. This role involves process streamlining, production issue troubleshooting, and collaboration with cross-functional teams to develop and refine operational workflows. Success in this position requires a proactive mindset, strong problem-solving skills, and the ability to drive continuous improvement.

The position will be out of our Toronto Headquarters.

What Will You Accomplish? / How You Will Make An Immediate Impact:

Process Streamlining and Optimization


Analyze existing workflows to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for automation
Design, implement, and maintain optimized processes for data ingestion, transformation, and delivery
Establish performance benchmarks and metrics to measure the effectiveness of process changes



Operational Support and Troubleshooting


Monitor production systems to identify and resolve operational issues proactively
Act as the first line of support for production-related challenges, escalating issues to appropriate teams as needed
Conduct root-cause analyses for recurring issues and implement long-term fixes



Collaboration and Cross-Functional Coordination


Work closely with data engineering, development, and product teams to ensure alignment on operational processes
Facilitate communication between teams to address dependencies and ensure smooth handoffs during workflows
Develop and document standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure consistency and knowledge sharing across teams



Continuous Improvement


Gather feedback from stakeholders to refine workflows and improve user experience
Stay informed about industry best practices and emerging technologies to enhance operations
Champion a culture of continuous improvement by driving initiatives that increase efficiency and reduce downtime
Other duties as assigned



Requirements

3+ years of experience in process optimization, operations management, or a similar role within a data-driven environment
2-3 years of hands-on leadership experience

Experience in a DaaS, SaaS, or cloud-based environment
Strong problem-solving skills with experience in troubleshooting production systems
Excellent communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work effectively across teams
Proficiency in tools like Excel, SQL, or other data management and reporting tools

Join a purpose driven winning team, committed to results, in an inclusive and high-performing culture.

Position: Investment Banking Analyst

Start Date: August 2025

Location: Vancouver, BC

Application Deadline: 04/25/2025

Who We Are

Global Banking & Markets provides a full range of investment banking, credit and risk management products and services relevant to the financing and strategic development needs of our clients. Our products include debt and equity financing, mergers & acquisitions, corporate banking, institutional equity sales, trading and research, fixed income products, derivatives, energy, foreign exchange, and precious metals. We also cross-sell the full range of wholesale products and services offered by the Scotiabank Group.

Analysts in Investment Banking enjoy a stimulating and challenging work environment in which they execute a broad range of transactions. A high degree of responsibility is afforded to those demonstrating initiative and the desire to take on such responsibility.

At the early stages of their career, Analysts focus on client presentations, financial modeling, and research. As the individual‚Äôs career progresses, Analysts take on increased responsibilities on live transactions under the guidance of senior group members. Scotiabank brings new Analysts in contact with senior team members and clients at the earliest possible stage, allowing them to gain experience in managing and cultivating relationships.

A significant amount of effort, diligence and initiative is required to properly execute assignments. The complexity of clients‚Äô financial requirements coupled with the intense competitiveness of the investment banking industry necessitates a full commitment to the task at hand. Standards are very high as most work is presented to senior executives at client firms and supervision is provided only to the extent that it is required.

With a limited hierarchy of professionals and a small team approach, Analysts have ample opportunity for career growth and development. On any given project, Analysts will interact with other departments of the firm such as Corporate Banking, Equity Capital Markets, Global Fixed Income and Global Equity Derivatives gaining knowledge and understanding of both investment banking and the capital markets.

New Analysts may participate in the Capital Ideas Program, an intensive training program developed by the Firm. The program is designed to orient participants to our culture, people, products and services and to provide the soft and technical skills, and contacts critical for success. Team projects, individual study and social activities supplement classroom discussions.

Is this role right for you? In this role, you will:


Evaluate and analyze the financial needs of corporate clients, including the development of financial models
Create marketing materials and presentations
Support transaction structuring and execution efforts, with increasing levels of responsibility and accountability over time
Identify and develop business opportunities with clients
Perform comprehensive financial statement analysis and create and maintain models
Collect, consolidate, and interpret company and industry data
Financial and written analysis of companies and industries
Prepare client presentations, including compiling data and assembling presentation materials
Support drafting of prospectuses, related documentation, and marketing materials for transactions
Apply product and capital markets knowledge to help clients achieve their financial objectives


Requirements

Do you have the skills and requirements that will enable you to succeed in this role? ‚Äì We‚Äôd love to work with you if:
