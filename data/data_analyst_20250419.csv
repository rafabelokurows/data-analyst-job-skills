Mastercard powers economies and empowers people in 200+ countries and territories worldwide. Together with our customers, we’re helping build a sustainable economy where everyone can prosper. We support a wide range of digital payments choices, making transactions secure, simple, smart and accessible. Our technology and innovation, partnerships and networks combine to deliver a unique set of products and services that help people, businesses and governments realize their greatest potential.

Title And Summary

Analyst, Big Data Analytics & Engineering

Analyst, Big Data Analytics & Engineering

Who is Mastercard?

Mastercard is a global technology company in the payments industry. Our mission is to connect and power an inclusive, digital economy that benefits everyone, everywhere by making transactions safe, simple, smart, and accessible. Using secure data and networks, partnerships and passion, our innovations and solutions help individuals, financial institutions, governments, and businesses realize their greatest potential.

Our decency quotient, or DQ, drives our culture and everything we do inside and outside of our company. With connections across more than 210 countries and territories, we are building a sustainable world that unlocks priceless possibilities for all.

Our Team

Ekata, a Mastercard company, is the global standard in identity verification, providing businesses worldwide the ability to link any digital transaction to the human behind it. Our Ekata Identity Network, the first and only of its kind, uses complex machine learning to combine features derived from the billions of transactions within our proprietary network and the data from our graph to deliver industry leading risk assessment solutions.

Graph & Tools team is looking for an Analyst who will be responsible for measuring and ensuring the quality of Graph data. This includes the ingestion pipeline from evaluating licensed provider data through merge steps and publishing to production. Because the Graph ingestion pipeline is automated, many of the checks will be automated and implemented as pass/fail decisions based on generated reports. At other times, manual review will be required to evaluate new data providers or to check code or process changes.

Our ideal candidate will understand the challenges of working with data at scale and have a firm knowledge of algorithms and processing complexity. This role requires a strong analytical mindset, attention to detail, and the ability to work collaboratively with various departments to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

Our team is a mix of software engineers and data analysts working to ensure our inputs, algorithms, and publishing artifacts are of the highest quality and efficiency. Our output is critical to the accuracy of our Risk Analysis APIs which power top e-commerce sites. Constant improvement and innovation are designed into our process. Your ability to learn and grow will be recognized and rewarded.

The Role

We are seeking an Analyst who will:


Create reports of quality and other metrics within Databricks. This requires both knowing the Spark tool and understanding where data is located within AWS and the environment.
Read and write Spark code using Scala. Graph team processing and reporting is currently all written in Scala.
Understand the Graph ingestion pipeline and how the data is used in production for our models and ProInsight.
Summarize findings in Confluence to verify quality or evaluate alternate paths.
Partner with various teams (i.e., Product Manager, Data Science, Engineering) on data needs/requirements in order to deliver data solutions that generate business value.
Identify innovative ideas and deliver proof of concepts, prototypes to deliver against the existing and future needs and propose new products, services and enhancements
Analyse large volumes of transaction and product data to generate insights and actionable recommendations to drive business growth
Apply knowledge of metrics, measurements, and benchmarking to complex and demanding solutions



All About You


Bachelor’s degree in computer science, Information Systems, Finance, Statistics, or a related field.
Experience with the Apache Spark ecosystem in a production environment

Experience in automation of reporting processes using scripting languages (Python) is a plus.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Payment Intelligence Engineering’s purpose is to mitigate threats to our systems in order to keep our merchants, Stripe and financial partners safe. We empower global businesses with intelligent solutions for conversion and fraud prevention, leveraging consumer intelligence and transparent ML to maximize growth and build trust. Our Payments Intelligence portfolio delivers actionable insights to all user segments.

The Payments Health Technical Operations team is pioneering new ways to achieve this mission. Our dynamic team relies on the expertise of integration reliability engineers and data analysts to identify gaps and build comprehensive solutions in the ever changing arena of fraud prevention.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and maintain SQL queries to analyze and navigate complex financial data effectively.
Enhance overall observability by identifying gaps and proposing actionable insights to improve our monitoring systems.
Actively hunt for patterns and anomalies in data that could indicate potential threats or operational issues.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to consolidate and gather relevant data for informed engineering efforts.
Design and implement comprehensive dashboards for real-time visibility into key metrics and system health.
Establish and refine key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress and improvements over time.
Support the creation and maintenance of observability frameworks to ensure early detection of issues.
Contribute to efforts that reduce organizational toil by optimizing data analysis processes.
Communicate findings and insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Stay updated with industry trends in data analysis and financial data handling to ensure best practices.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have 5+ years of experience in Payments at a leading technology or payments company
Have experience writing SQL to query relational databases
Have experience managing communications and workflows with technical and non-technical teams across internal and external stakeholders
Experience mentoring junior team members in technical skill development, operational strategy and problem solving
Have experience navigating the nuanced complexity of financial systems and solving large scale, technical challenges
Have strong financial modeling and analytical skills to investigate, prioritize, and identify the root cause of issues
Have experience managing multiple, concurrent work streams, identifying and triaging technical issues and driving solutions with clear metrics to show impact



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,400 - $219,600. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

The two largest components of the annual budget are Professional Fee Income and Extramural Funds, representing 90.4% or $132 million (including ZSFG professional fees and 6.9% or $10.1 million of the annual budget respectively. Currently, the department has over 298 Faculty members, 27 Staff Physicians, 205 Staff Employees, 6 Fellows, 90 Residents, 12 Non-Faculty Academics, 11 Post Docs, 68 CRNAs and 5 Nurse Practitioners at ZSFG .

In addition to the Moffitt-Long Hospital, very active units of the department exist at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (inpatient and outpatient, including a very active trauma service), San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (inpatient and outpatient), Mt. Zion Medical Center (outpatient, including 23 hour stays and the Pain Management Center), Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, the UCSF Orthopedic Institute and the Benioff Children's, Betty Irene Moore Women's and Bakar Cancer (NIH-designated Cancer Center) Hospitals in the Mission Bay neighborhood.

The Department now has essential roles in patient care outside of the operating rooms, with active participation in Ambulatory Care, Acute and Chronic Pain, and in the Preoperative Clinic. Over the department’s fifty-plus years of existence, the department has been at the heart of modern anesthesia’s explosive growth, and to this day continues to have an enormous impact on surgical practice and the management of pain. The department’s research, education, and clinical care quickly earned and have maintained reputations that are the equal or better of any institution in the world. Individual members of our faculty have had a major influence on our specialty both nationally and internationally, including NIH study sections, NIH funding, FDA and Editorial Boards. Research activities within this department are integrated with and inform clinical practice. For many years, ours has been among the top departments for NIH research funding in anesthesia in the United States.

The Department of Anesthesia provides considerable support and structure for research in general and, for research training programs, highlighted by the innovative Pathway to Scientific Independence (PSI). This program begins at the residency level, incorporating the Research Scholars Track of the Anesthesia Residency, moving through the post-residency NIH-funded T32 training grant, and faculty positions with a mentored research support, and ultimately to achieving extramurally funded, independent researcher status.

At the University of California, Berkeley, we are dedicated to fostering a community where everyone feels welcome and can thrive. Our culture of openness, freedom and belonging make it a special place for students, faculty and staff.

As a world-leading institution, Berkeley is known for its academic and research excellence, public mission, diverse student body, and commitment to equity and social justice. Since our founding in 1868, we have driven innovation, creating global intellectual, economic and social value.

We are looking for applicants who reflect California's diversity and want to be part of an inclusive, equity-focused community that views education as a matter of social justice. Please consider whether your values align with our Guiding Values and Principles, Principles of Community, and Strategic Plan.

At UC Berkeley, we believe that learning is a fundamental part of working, and provide space for supportive colleague communities via numerous employee resource groups (staff organizations).

We actively support this by providing all of our full-time staff employees with at least 80 hours (10 days) of paid time per year to engage in professional development activities.

Departmental Overview

UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business offers a unique opportunity to champion new ideas, collaborate across boundaries, and continually learn in a workplace committed to increasing diversity and creating a welcoming environment for all. Our distinctive culture is captured within our four Defining Leadership Principles: Question the Status Quo, Confidence Without Attitude, Students Always, and Beyond Yourself. These principles distinguish Berkeley Haas as a unique environment conducive to teamwork, collaboration, and career growth.

This position will work with a Professor in the Haas School of Business on a specific research project, one designed to study whether “high road” worker- owned companies can create high-quality jobs and improve productivity despite the fact that the low market share of these organizational forms suggest that the benefits may not usually arise or that market imperfections may impede their growth. This study therefore looks at worker-owned companies in California and will explore whether public policies could cost-effectively promote them. The study will focus particularly on whether worker ownership fits well with the needs of workers from historically disadvantaged groups.

Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.

Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.

We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense. We have offices located in the SoHo neighborhood of New York, the Mission District in San Francisco, and Lawrenceville in Pittsburgh.

The Role

Our generative AI-powered products are revolutionizing the practice of medicine, and we’re looking for a highly motivated Senior Data Analyst to join our growing US-based Data Science & BI team. Your work will be instrumental in driving product strategy, directly influencing how healthcare professionals engage with patient data.

What You'll Do

Data Analysis and Insight Generation


Extract meaningful insights and identify trends and patterns relevant to our business and product, by collecting, cleaning, and analyzing internal and external data
Ensure end-to-end visibility and understanding of our AI generation pipelines, from internal quality metrics to automated assessment in production.
Investigate and correct issues identified through data operations monitors, tools, and reports.


Cross-Functional Leadership and Collaboration


Effectively communicate trends and patterns to internal and external stakeholders, by developing and maintaining live dashboards
Serve as a domain expert for the business context of our analytics data, sharing your understanding of the assumptions and limitations of our business metrics.
Continually enhance our understanding of the business and product, by identifying and filling gaps in our data sources. This includes working closely with multidisciplinary teams such as product, engineering, partner success, and the executive team.


Who You Are


8+ years of experience in Data Analytics, BI or a related field, ideally at a product-focused software company.
Expert-level SQL skills with proficiency in writing efficient queries on large and complex data sets.
Understanding of database technology and experience with a cloud SQL data warehouse (e.g. BigQuery, Postgres, Snowflake)
Experience in analytical data modeling and schema design
Experience with a data visualization tool (e.g. Tableau, Looker, Sigma)


Data Advocate


Excellent communicator capable of effectively delivering quantitative findings to non-technical stakeholders in a clear and compelling fashion.
A team player, comfortable assisting others across the organization in solving data problems and answering questions with data
Passionate about data quality, with a keen interest in data drill down and problem-solving
Ability to prioritize amidst changing priorities in a fast moving environment


Domain-relevant Knowledge


Knowledge of healthcare settings, electronic health records (EHR), and healthcare billing are all a plus
Experience with common approaches to measure and drive user engagement is a plus


Base Salary: $153,000 USD - $189,000 USD per year + Equity

The salary range provided is based on transparent pay guidelines and is an estimate for candidates residing in the San Francisco Bay area. The actual base salary will vary depending on the candidate's location, relevant experience, skills, qualifications, and other job-related factors. Additionally, this role may include the opportunity to participate in a company stock option plan as part of the total compensation package.

Must be willing to work from our SF office at least 3x per week

This position requires a commitment to a hybrid work model, with the expectation of coming into the office a minimum of (3) three times per week. Relocation assistance is available for candidates willing to move to San Francisco.

We value people who are eager to learn new things and recognize that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.

Why work at Abridge?

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

How we take care of Abridgers:


Generous Time Off: 13 paid holidays, flexible PTO for salaried employees, and accrued time off for hourly employees.
Comprehensive Health Plans: Medical, Dental, and Vision plans for all full-time employees. Abridge covers 100% of the premium for you and 75% for dependents. If you choose a HSA-eligible plan, Abridge also makes monthly contributions to your HSA.
Paid Parental Leave: 16 weeks paid parental leave for all full-time employees.
401k and Matching: Contribution matching to help invest in your future.
Pre-tax Benefits: Access to Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) and Commuter Benefits.
Learning and Development Budget: Yearly contributions for coaching, courses, workshops, conferences, and more.
Sabbatical Leave: 30 days of paid Sabbatical Leave after 5 years of employment.
Compensation and Equity: Competitive compensation and equity grants for full time employees.
... and much more!


Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying safe - Protect yourself from recruitment fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article.

This is a high-impact, hands-on role focused on shaping how enterprise and portfolio data is accessed, prepared, and consumed by quantitative researchers, portfolio managers, and downstream analytics teams.

This opportunity sits at the intersection of data engineering and quant development-but is neither fully a dev role nor purely a data engineering role. The ideal candidate understands the nuances of financial data, has strong technical acumen, and is energized by building modern data systems that support alpha research and portfolio construction at scale.

Key Responsibilities:

Build and maintain robust data pipelines to make enterprise and portfolio data accessible, reliable, and analysis-ready
Own end-to-end ingestion and transformation of internal and external financial datasets
Collaborate closely with quant researchers, PMs, and risk managers to understand how data is consumed and enhance its usability
Ensure data quality, lineage, and availability across the firm's analytical infrastructure
Contribute to broader data modernization efforts across risk and research teams

Ideal Candidate:

3-7 years of experience in a data-driven role supporting front-office or research teams at a hedge fund, asset manager, or proprietary trading firm
Strong programming skills (Python preferred); experience with modern data tooling and pipeline design
Familiarity with financial market data, portfolio data, or risk data
Able to operate with autonomy in a lean, high-performance team
Strategic thinker who enjoys building from the ground up and partnering with stakeholders across quant, tech, and risk

This is a unique opportunity to join a successful and growing team during a pivotal period of transformation, reporting directly into a senior leader overseeing risk and data. You'll play a critical role in how data is structured, accessed, and leveraged across the firm.

Please state which internship(s) you are applying for in your cover letter and apply to each one individually.

This is a paid internship, working 16 hours per week from July 7th, 2025 through December 19th 2025. Current Salary is $19.18 per hour.

Position Summary:

The Audience Intelligence team is charged with providing KQED with the data needed to make data informed decisions. The team serves as the central data hub for the organization and works with a variety of departments including news, science, arts, marketing, foundations and audience development. The Audience Intelligence intern will have many responsibilities including the mining of previous survey data sets for insights, and supporting future research through completion of qualitative interviews, questionnaire development, and survey analysis. The intern will also have the lead on a project allowing them to complete the internship with a deliverable that can be used in their future job search.

This role is typically the best fit for candidates who are motivated by questions about how people think and behave, and who are considering careers involving UX, market, product, or design research. Applicants who are mainly interested in quantitative analysis are encouraged to apply instead to our analytics internship.

KQED envisions a public media organization with a culture that centers on human dignity, equity, and belonging. This will enable us to better serve and reflect the Bay Area through diverse and inclusive storytelling.

We value the contributions of marginalized people in society — including Black, Indigenous, and all people of color, people with disabilities, and LGBTQIA+ people — and we believe that these communities must be centered in the work we do, and we strongly encourage members of these communities to apply.

The mission that drives us:

KQED provide citizens of Northern California with a community-supported alternative to commercial media. We provide citizens with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions; convene community dialogue; bring the arts to everyone and engage audiences to share their stories. We help students and teachers thrive in 21st-century classrooms, and take people of all ages on journeys of exploration- exposing them to new people, places and ideas.

This role requires working inKQED's newly renovated headquartersand working in the field. KQED requires employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

Essential Functions:


Help develop new insights and analyses that inform organizational decisions and help us continue to engage our audiences through research projects
Support research projects with interviews, questionnaire development, analysis, and learnings
Presentation building for a variety of stakeholders
Develop reports and visualizations to convey research findings
Analyze and interpret information from multiple data sources
Other Duties as assigned


Knowledge/Experience Required:


An academic background in the social sciences (psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, behavioral economics, cognitive linguistics, etc.)is preferred, but we also consider applicants with design and STEM backgrounds
Basic knowledge of probability and statistics
Interest in data analysis and visualization
Excellent writing, research, and communication skills
Strong attention to detail
Problem-solving acumen
Capacity to balance multiple responsibilities
Ability to work independently
Bonus points for fluency in languages of data manipulation or statistical analysis (e.g. Python, R, or SQL)


Growth & Development Opportunities:

Audience Intelligence interns have a huge impact on what we do. They are a full-fledged member of our team and their life experience, opinions, and ideas bring fresh approaches to the work we do and are incredibly valuable. As part of the audience intelligence team, the intern will learn what it means to put our audiences first as we look to find the stories in their data that will allow us to grow a younger, more diverse audience base. This internship will help develop and hone analytical, and communication skills. If there is anything specific an intern wants to learn about audience intelligence, we are committed to making that happen.

The role

As part of our mission to scale end-to-end embodied AI for autonomous driving, we are building a world-class Data Management team focused on unlocking high-quality, targeted data acquisition that drives model performance and predictability. We are looking for a highly analytical and systems-minded ODD & Behavioral Competency Analyst to lead the analysis of Operational Design Domains (ODDs), traffic patterns, and regulatory behaviors across our target markets.

This role will be critical in defining what data is needed, where, and how much, in order to build models with high Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and generalization capabilities across varied geographies.

Key Responsibilities


Analyze and define the operational design domain (ODD) for each target market or region, including geography, infrastructure, weather, road types, traffic density, and local driving behaviors.
Identify ODD boundaries, edge conditions, and failure triggers to inform data collection and system design.
Build and maintain a taxonomy of behavioral competencies (e.g., merging, yielding, unprotected turns, interacting with pedestrians) required to safely operate in each ODD.
Quantify the complexity and frequency of each competency based on local traffic data, regulations, and real-world observations.
Develop a framework to compute and prioritize permutations of ODD parameters and behavioral competencies to optimize data collection, scenario coverage, and scaling efficiency.
Recommend minimal data slices needed to support safe and predictable system performance in a new region.
Analyze traffic laws, enforcement patterns, and common driving behaviors in new markets to assess differences in required system behavior and edge case risks.
Collaborate with legal and safety teams to map regulations to system-level behavioral expectations.
Work closely with data engineering, safety, simulation, product, and deployment teams to turn ODD and competency insights into actionable data strategies and deployment plans.
Provide input to scenario library development, synthetic data generation, and test case prioritization.
Use historical data and statistical models to identify data gaps or high-variance behaviors that impact MTBF performance.
Provide guidance on what additional data is needed to reach MTBF targets in each ODD segment.


About You

In order to set you up for success as a Data Analyst at Wayve, we’re looking for the following skills and experience.

Essential


Strong background in systems engineering, transportation analysis, data science, or a related field.
Proven experience with traffic system modeling, autonomous driving deployment, or urban mobility analysis.
Experience analyzing or defining ODDs in the context of AV/ADAS technologies is a strong plus.
Familiarity with traffic regulations and human driving behaviors across multiple geographies.
Proficiency in data analysis tools (e.g., Python, SQL, GIS, Jupyter) and ability to visualize ODD and scenario coverage metrics.
Ability to work cross-functionally and translate domain analysis into technical and product requirements.
Experience working in an agile, fast-scaling environment with a strong execution mindset.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our team is a part of Strategy & Analytics (S&A), which maximizes and accelerates Operations' ability to make Stripe work for our users. We work cross-functionally with global teams to help run the day-to-day business, taking a data-driven approach that combines strategy and analytics to help Ops leaders solve their most complex and most important issues while also driving the business planning and operational cadence end-to-end, from strategy to goal-setting to execution.

What you’ll do

We are seeking a Data Analyst to drive and enable business performance in Ops’ Strategy & Analytics team. In this role, you will be a critical partner in driving data-driven decision making across Stripe Operations. You'll work closely with cross-functional, technical stakeholders to identify and address their most impactful challenges using data and analyses. You'll own the development and implementation of experiments, key metrics, ML models, and data pipelines, ensuring the foundational systems in Stripe Operations are robust, high-quality, and reliable. You'll work hand-in-hand with partner teams in Data Science, Product, and Engineering to implement data-driven solutions that optimize our processes and tools. Acting as a technical expert and bridge between the Strategy and Analytics team and our operational partners, you'll champion the use of data to inform high-impact projects and initiatives.

If you are incessantly curious, eager to solve big data challenges, relentless, passionate about helping users, and interested in diving into a quickly-growing team and company, we want to hear from you.

Incubate machine learning models, and partner with Data Science for their productionization
Partner with Operations and Engineering teams on the implementation of high impact data projects, championing data driven decision making



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles
Mastery of SQL and a strong understanding of data relationships / relational databases, experience working with large datasets.
Proficiency in Scala, Python, or another programming language
Strong statistical knowledge
Proven skills in A/B testing, experiment set-up, and analysis
Experience with applied machine learning techniques
Expertise using data insights to drive business and operational goals - outstanding analytical ability, communication, and presentation skills

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $182,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Pearl Health is powering the future of healthcare. We help primary care providers and organizations to deliver quality healthcare to the patients who need it most, when they need it most — and get rewarded for keeping patients healthy.

Our technology, services, and financial tools enable better, more proactive care, decrease total cost of care across patient panels, and optimize performance in value-based care models for Traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage.

We are a team of physicians and public health experts (Stanford, Harvard, Mount Sinai), technologists (athenahealth, Amazon, Meta, Flatiron), healthcare innovators (Centivo, Aledade, Stellar, Arcadia), and experienced risk management professionals (CVS/Aetna, Humana, Oscar) who believe that primary care providers are the key to addressing our healthcare system’s biggest challenges.

Since its founding in 2020, Pearl has expanded to partner with thousands of primary care providers in practices and organizations across 44 states. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Viking Global Investors, AlleyCorp, and SV Angel.

This role provides an opportunity to leverage your analytical and architectural expertise to make a tangible impact on healthcare.

Manage ambiguity while working with cross-functional teams on complex projects, with a focus on defining data requirements, developing analytical models, and interpreting results.
Partner with Data Engineering and Product to create end-to-end data pipelines that turn raw data into actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.
Contribute to the development of the data analytics roadmap and strategy by collaborating with leadership in the Data Science and Analytics organization to identify opportunities and propose technical and business-level solutions with a medium-term (1-2 year) time horizon.
Evaluate new data technologies and tools (including data warehouses, orchestration systems, and BI tools) to enhance the team's capabilities.
Mentor other data analysts, providing guidance on analytical techniques and best practices.
Help your manager establish standards, design guidelines, and SOPs for analytical workflows, e.g., dashboard development, EDA, and ingestion of new datasets.
