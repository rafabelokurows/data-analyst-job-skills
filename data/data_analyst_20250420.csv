Als Data Analyst für Healthcare Analytics bist du Teil von Beratungsteams bei Klienten sowie von internen Projekten, Recherchen und Analysen zu Unternehmen und Trends in den europäischen Gesundheitssystemen. Wir sind Teil von McKinseys globalem Client Capability Network (client capability network) mit mehr als 7.000 Kolleginnen und Kollegen, die unsere Klienten und Beratungsteams mit Expertise und Branchenanalysen unterstützen. Zur Verstärkung unseres Teams in Deutschland suchen wir dich zum nächstmöglichen Zeitpunkt als Data Analyst für Healthcare Analytics.

Das Healthcare Analytics Team nutzt Analysen und Daten aus dem Gesundheitswesen (z.B. Krankenversicherungen oder Gesundheitseinrichtungen), um einige der dringendsten Herausforderungen unserer Klienten zu beantworten, wie zum Beispiel „Wie können wir die Kosten der Gesundheitsversorgung optimieren und gleichzeitig die Qualität verbessern?“, „Wie können wir mit KI/ML Prozesse optimieren und bspw. Rechnungsbetrug automatisiert erkennen?“, „Wer sind die sensibelsten Patientengruppen und mit welchen Behandlungspfaden können wir ihre Versorgung verbessern?“

Healthcare Analytics ist ein Team innerhalb der SHaPE-Practice (Social, Healthcare and Public Entities) mit Fokus auf der spezialisierten Beratung von Einrichtungen des Gesundheitswesens, insbesondere Kostenträgern. Unser Ziel ist es, mit der Unterstützung von Advanced Analytics, KI sowie unseren standardisierten Methoden für Diagnostik, Optimierung und Implementierung für unsere Klienten positive und nachhaltige Veränderung zu erzielen.

Your Impact

In der Rolle als Data Analyst in Healthcare Analytics unterstützt du unsere Beratungsteams mit quantitativen Analysen sowie KI/ML-Ansätzen und entwickelst unser Portfolio an datengetriebenen Lösungen und innovativen Lösungsansätzen kontinuierlich weiter.

Du wirst eng mit unseren Klienten aus verschiedenen Bereichen wie Krankenversicherungen, Leistungserbringern oder Private Equity zusammenarbeiten und dabei deine Fähigkeiten im Projektmanagement und in der Kommunikation mit diversen Stakeholdern einsetzen.

Im Healthcare Analytics Team handeln wir unternehmerisch. Daher suchen wir jemanden mit der Motivation, kontinuierlich den Status Quo zu verbessern und dies auch eigenständig voranzutreiben.

Als Data Analyst wird von dir erwartet, dass du Erfahrung im Umgang mit großen Datensätzen, insbesondere in der Analyse und Modellierung, mitbringst. Idealerweise hast du auch Kenntnisse in den Bereichen Künstliche Intelligenz (KI) und Maschinelles Lernen (ML). Erste Erfahrungen im Gesundheitswesen, wie z.B. bei Krankenversicherungen oder Leistungserbringern, sind von Vorteil. Du solltest Begeisterung für quantitative Analysen zeigen und Interesse daran haben, dich in diesen Bereichen weiterzubilden und zusätzliche Kenntnisse und Fähigkeiten zu erwerben.

Deine täglichen Aufgaben umfassen die Analyse und Modellierung großer Datensätze sowie die enge Zusammenarbeit mit unseren Data Engineers beim Aufbau und der Pflege unserer McKinsey Big Data Plattform. Du wirst Dashboards und ML/KI-Modelle entwickeln, wobei du sowohl Low-Code/No-Code-Tools als auch Python und Visualisierungstools nutzen kannst. Im täglichen Geschäft arbeitest du eng mit unseren Data Engineering Kollegen, dem Capabilities and Insights Team sowie unseren Beratungsteams zusammen, um die Kundenarbeit vorzubereiten und durchzuführen.

Your Qualifications and Skills


Mit sehr gutem Erfolg abgeschlossenes Master- oder Promotionsstudium in einem wirtschaftswissenschaftlichen Studiengang mit Fokus auf Data Analytics/Science oder in einem MINT-Fach; ein Bezug zum Gesundheitswesen ist von Vorteil, aber nicht zwingend erforderlich
2+ Jahre Berufserfahrung in einem relevanten Bereich (z.B. Data Analytics/ Science, Business Intelligence oder Beratung)
Grundkenntnisse in mindestens einem BI-Tool wie Tableau und PowerBI
Grundkenntnisse in einer Programmiersprache wie Python, SQL oder Äquivalent

Getreu unserem Motto – People is what makes us us – sind uns deine nachhaltige Ausbildung und Weiterentwicklung, deine ausgeglichene Work-Life-Balance und deine Happiness sehr wichtig. Konkret stellen wir mit 32 Urlaubstagen, 60 % mobilem Arbeiten, bis zu 4 Wochen pro Jahr – im europäischen Ausland – der Möglichkeit remote zu arbeiten, Sabbatical und Überstundenausgleich sicher, dass dir im FUSE-Agentur-Leben nichts fehlt.

In unserem derzeit über 60-köpfigen Team sowie unseren Kund*innen haben wir unser perfektes Match bereits gefunden. Wenn du noch auf der Suche bist, bei „popkulturellem Relevanzmarketing“ neugierig wirst und für Social Media, Influencer Marketing oder Gaming & Esports brennst, dann lass uns zusammen loslegen! Denn : Action Creates Impact .

Dein Job

Als (Junior) Insights Analyst (mensch) bearbeitest du als Teil unseres Data und Analytics Teams in erster Linie die Anfragen unserer Kunden nach Social Media Reportings sowie Social Listening Analysen und beherrschst den Spagat zwischen analytischem und kreativem Denken, um die Kolleg:Innen in deinem und anderen Teams mit datenbasierten Insights zu Kundenmeinungen, Märkten, Zielgruppen, Marken und ihren Social Media-Umfeldern zu versorgen.

Dein Aufgabenbereich

Datenbeschaffung / Toolbedienung

Du bist präzise, schnell, zuverlässig und motiviert, wenn es um die manuelle Erfassung großer (Social Media)- Datenmengen geht, aber auch wissbegierig und begeisterungsfähig, dich diesbezüglich kontinuierlich mit Prozessoptimierung zu befassen, sowie dich in Tools und automatisierte Datenerfassungsprozesse und Methoden einzudenken, um immer bessere Lösungen zu finden.

Datenstrukturierung, Effiziente Datensammlung, Query Writing, Kategorisierung und Datendarstellung werden hier deine täglichen Begleiter.

Studiendurchführung

Von der (manchmal noch recht schwammigen) Fragestellung bis zum fertigen Analysebericht mit guten Insights und Handlungsempfehlungen ist es oft ein weiter aber spannender Weg. Der kann bald auch deiner sein, gemeinsam mit uns im Team.

Du hast ein sehr gutes Gespür für Sprache und Kommunikation? Nice, das brauchst du hier in mindestens dreierlei Hinsicht: Erstens, um aus den Aussagen und Briefings unserer Auftraggeber herausfiltern zu können, wie du ihnen am besten weiterhelfen kannst. Zweitens, wenn es darum geht, die Essenz von Konsumenten-Posts und Kommentaren auf Social Media zu verstehen, schließlich ist Inhaltanalyse unser Daily-Business. Und Drittens, um dann Deine Findings Zielgruppengerecht rüberzubringen - in Reports, in Meetings und bei Präsentationen.

Datenanalyse

Auswertungslogiken passend zu den gegebenen Fragestellungen und Erkenntnisinteressen erstellen, Dimensionierungen & Kategorisierungen für Inhaltsanalysen planen und entwickeln, Daten auszählen, filtern, darstellen, vergleichen, interpretieren, daraus kreative Idee und Empfehlungen ableiten. Das ist dein Playground. Deine Affinität zu Zahlen und Daten kannst du hier immer wieder beweisen. Ein stets strukturiertes Vorgehen und ein souveräner Umgang auch mit großen und komplexen Datenmengen, Statistiken und Zahlen sind für dich selbstverständlich.

Spezielle Social Media Analyse-Tools wirst Du ebenso (kennenlernen und) zum Einsatz bringen wie ganz viel Excel und das gute alte Powerpoint.

Das bringst du mit

Du kannst (erste) Erfahrung in der qualitativen und quantitativen Forschungsarbeit, sowie in der marketing- oder kundenorientierten Projektarbeit vorweisen und hast Lust dich im Bereich Social Media Analytics weiter auszutoben. Du hast, dank deines Studiums, einen kommunikations-, sozial- oder medienwissenschaftlichen Background und bringst Kenntnisse der Methoden im Bereich der quantitativen und qualitativen Marktforschung mit. Du hast neben den analytischen Fähigkeiten, auch ein Gespür für gute kreative Kommunikation und Lust, diese mitzuentwickeln. Du bist organisiert und selbständig, willst aber auch noch ständig ganz viel lernen und verstehst dich als Teamplayer, der immer auf Höhe des Zeitgeists ist und daraus neue Impulse für unsere Teams und Kunden ableitet. Außerdem hast Du sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse in Wort und Schrift, sehr gute MS Office Kenntnisse, insbesondere Excel und PowerPoint und bist im besten Fall mit Analytics Tools im Bereich Social Listening & Web Analytics vertraut.

Darum wir

Als Teil der FUSE erfährst du stets Rückenwind von deinem Team, arbeitest für Kunden - die unsere Werte „BOLD. TRUE. EASY. TOGETHER.“ leben und kannst aktiv Prozesse und Strukturen mitentwickeln. Denn ganz getreu unserem Wert TOGETHER setzen wir auf das Potential im Team. Neben unvergesslichen Events bieten wir dir viel Raum für persönliche und berufliche Weiterentwicklung.

We aim to use state-of-the-art technologies while being fully pragmatic (we do not crack a walnut with a sledgehammer). We follow an ELT philosophy and divide the tasks between Data Engineering and Analytics Engineering accordingly.

As one of our analytics engineers, you play a critical role in helping our clients to generate business value out of their existing data sets. There are no two ways about it – you’re a Data Magician.

By collaborating with clients, you find practical solutions to problems.

You have the opportunity to work on difficult problems while helping startups and SMEs to make well-informed decisions based on data.

Challenges

Collaborate and connect with domain experts to solve data obstacles in various industries
Develop advanced data reporting and visualizations
Apply data modeling methodologies and contribute to a robust data platform for our clients

Optional: Experience with one or more data visualization tools
Optional: Experience with managing stakeholders and/or clients
Optional: First understanding of data modeling techniques (e.g. Data Vault or Kimball’s Dimensional Modelling) and data warehousing in general


Technologies you’ll use

Working with multiple clients, we are in touch with many technologies, which is truly exciting. We aim to use state-of-the-art technologies while being fully pragmatic (we do not crack a walnut with a sledgehammer). We follow an ELT philosophy and divide the tasks between Data Engineering and Analytics Engineering accordingly.

The Following Technologies Constitute Our Preferred Data Tech Stack


Data Loading
For most clients, we use our own open-source Python library EWAH and Apache Airflow
For simple requests, we work with Fivetran or Stitch
Data Warehousing
For smaller data loads, we mostly use PostgreSQL databases
For larger datasets, we work with Snowflake or BigQuery
Data Transformation
We love to work with data build tool (dbt)
Data Visualization


For smaller businesses with < 100 FTE, we mostly recommend Metabase as a powerful open-source reporting tool
For specified needs and a centralized BI, we recommend PowerBI or Tableau
For a decentralized, self-service BI with more than 50 users, we recommend Looker


Gemma Perks

We are located in Berlin, close to Nordbahnhof. We are currently 20 colleagues and will grow to 22 colleagues until the end of the year. Other perks include


We have an honest, inclusive work environment and want to nurture this environment
We have frequent team events in Berlin: our cultural base
We encourage workcations and even do workcations as a company - it is up to you to come to the office between one and five days a week
We don’t compromise on equipment - a powerful Laptop, extra screens, and all the tools you need to be effective
We will surround you with great people who love to solve (mostly data) riddles
We believe in efficient working hours rather than long working hours - we focus on the output rather than the input
We learn and share during meetups, lunch & learn sessions and are open for further initiatives
We pay a market-friendly salary and we additionally distribute at least 20% of profits to our employees
We are fast-growing, have technology at our core, yet we do not rely on a VC and operate profitably
We have a great yearly offsite event that brings us all together for a full week, enjoying good food, having a good time, and of course, solving complex data-related tasks solving complex data-related tasks

If so, global change communications might be for you. We’re on the lookout for candidates who are interested in the world around them and are passionate about tackling global issues. At M+C Saatchi World Services we are focused on tackling some of humanity’s most challenging and important problems, in fragile states and developing countries, harnessing the power of cutting-edge communications and creativity to achieve long-term behaviour change.


The World Services Internship Programme is a paid 6-week scheme open to anyone looking to start a career in communications, with a focus on global change. It's a data boot camp designed for individuals passionate about the world of data science, data-driven insights and data analysis. Ideal for students or recent graduates, this programme offers the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in a dynamic and forward-thinking environment.

The internship will commence 21 July 2025 and run until 28 August 2025 based in our offices in Soho at regular business hours (9:30am – 6:00pm). Interns will be expected to come into the office at least three times per week at the discretion of their programme leads.

M+C Saatchi World Services will consider scheme graduates for potential employment opportunities. While a job is not guaranteed, the purpose of this program is to invest in potential future talent.

ABOUT THE ROLE

This role offers a unique opportunity to combine collaboration and learning. 

You'll work closely with a senior data scientist, gaining mentorship, guidance, and feedback on your data analysis projects. 
By actively participating in team meetings and project discussions, you'll contribute fresh perspectives and innovative ideas. 
To further develop your technical skillset, you'll undergo comprehensive training in data analysis tools and techniques, including SQL, and dashboarding. 
Finally, you'll master the art of data storytelling, preparing and presenting project reports that effectively communicate findings, methodologies, and results to both technical and non-technical audiences, ultimately impacting company decision-making.
You will be paid London Living Wage.

ABOUT YOU

We are looking for candidates who have:

Curious minds: We want someone who is naturally curious and fascinated by the world and why it is the way it is, particularly from a geo-political perspective. Someone who stops scrolling to read about what’s going on around the world and invests themselves in social issues. Someone who has a belief in the idea that communications, when applied properly, can lead to a better world.
A knack for collaborating: We work jointly with partners and agencies as well as other M&C Saatchi companies to provide support from strategy to implementation for many of our campaigns. We need a natural collaborator. Someone who empowers those around them and is open, willing and able to engage new people inside and outside of our organisation.
A desire for a meaningful career: What gets you out of bed in the morning? Those who are driven by a greater purpose and search for a ‘why’ in what they do will often find commercial careers unfulfilling. We are searching for the people who want their career to mean something.
Technical experience and programmatic ability: Candidates are expected to have the requisite skills to work within a data team. Knowledge of Python is essential, SQL desirable, and wider technical skills are welcomed. Familiarity with version control systems, especially Git, is strongly desirable. Candidates should be comfortable processing, understanding, and drawing insights from large datasets.

As we value curiosity and collaboration, we are looking for individuals who are naturally fascinated by the world and why it is the way it is, particularly from a data-driven perspective. A belief in the power of data and communications to improve the world is a must.

APPLICATION CLOSING DATE: Monday 05 May, 2025*


Successful candidates will be invited for a short video interview in mid-May 2025, or sooner, depending on application volume.

Please note: Internships are offered subject to the provision of a successful background check, and proof of right to work in the United Kingdom.

Hi, I’m Tobias, Director of Data Analytics at WebPros, and your future manager. With nearly 20 years of experience in the hosting industry as a developer and BI analyst, I joined WebPros over seven years ago as a data scientist. Throughout my time at WebPros, I initially contributed as a developer and later transitioned into a leadership role, helping to create a comprehensive reporting infrastructure that serves the entire organization.

This role is all about impact. We are looking for a Data Analyst to help us derive actionable insights and enhance data-driven decision-making. If you love autonomy, problem-solving, and working in an async-first, globally distributed team, this is an exciting opportunity to shape the future of our data analytics infrastructure.

You’ll thrive in this role if you’re comfortable navigating data landscapes, driving projects independently, and collaborating across teams to translate business needs into suitable reports and dashboards. If you’re excited about solving reporting challenges with SQL, Looker, and cloud technologies, you’ll find a great home here.

Below, you’ll find everything you need to decide if this role is right for you. From our culture and work style to the specifics of the position and hiring process. We believe in transparency, so we’ve put in the effort to give you a real, inside look at what it’s like to work here.

About WebPros

WebPros is committed to empowering businesses worldwide through cutting-edge solutions in web hosting, billing automation, infrastructure, server management, and online marketing. Since our founding in 2017, we’ve rapidly grown into a global leader, expanding our robust portfolio to include industry-defining brands such as cPanel & WHM, Plesk, WHMCS, SolusVM, NIXStats, XOVI, SocialBee, and Sitejet.

Today, we power 85 million+ websites across 900,000+ servers worldwide, backed by a 600+ strong team of dedicated professionals spanning multiple continents. At WebPros, we embrace a fully remote, borderless workplace with a focus on flexibility, autonomy, and work-life balance. Whether you prefer working from a bustling city hub or a quiet home office, we enable our teams to thrive from anywhere while staying deeply connected through our strong collaborative culture.

Your Role

We are looking for a remote Data Analyst to help design, build, and optimize our reporting infrastructure. You will work with Google BigQuery, SQL, Looker Studio and similar reporting tools to develop interactive and insightful dashboards, build data models, and deliver data-driven insights.

Your Impact In The First 180 Days

We don’t believe in endless checklists of requirements. Instead, here’s what success looks like in your first 6 months:


30 Days: Get fully onboarded and familiarize yourself with our data infrastructure. Connect with stakeholders across teams to understand potential data needs and identify opportunities for improving current reporting, while also recognizing efficient practices.
60 Days: Deploy your first production-ready updates. Collaborate with the members of the analytics and engineering teams to experiment with dashboard optimizations that enhance reliability and incorporate best practices.
120 Days: You are ready to deploy new dashboards, which involves collaborating with business users, stakeholders, and data source owners. Additionally, you are familiar with the data infrastructure across the organisation and ready to understand the reporting needs of the business.
After 180 Days: You have become an invaluable member of the data analytics team. You have made a significant impact by introducing solutions that enhance the efficiency of dashboards and reporting and improve data quality and monitoring capabilities.


By this point, you won’t just be executing tasks. You’ll be making strategic contributions, improving how we report and share data across the organization, and positioning yourself as a key player in our Data & AI team.

You’ll Thrive Here If You


Have strong experience in dashboarding and reporting, general data analytics, SQL, along with experience in cloud providers such as Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure.
Can independently apply these skills to real-world challenges.
Take ownership of projects from concept to deployment, proactively solving problems and driving impact.
Enjoy working in an async-first, globally distributed team that values autonomy and deep work.
Excel in fast-paced environments where cross-functional collaboration is key to success.


You Might Struggle Here If You


Prefer highly structured roles with rigid processes and step-by-step workflows.
Find it challenging to navigate ambiguity or adapt to changing priorities.
Require constant guidance rather than taking initiative and driving your own work.
Are seeking an entry-level position with extensive hands-on mentorship.


How We Work


Team & Workflow: Fully remote, async-first team (CET timezone). We follow an Agile-inspired Scrumban workflow, minimizing meetings (~10-20% of the workweek) and prioritizing deep work.
Collaboration & Ownership: Self-managed work with a strong emphasis on accountability, autonomy, and decision-making.
Tech Stack & Tools: Google BigQuery, Looker Studio.
Cloud & Infrastructure: Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Testing & Quality: Shift-left approach, high test coverage.
Releases & CI/CD: Fully automated CI/CD, daily releases, no strict release cycles.


Our Culture

WebPros is built on diversity, not just in principle but by design. We’ve grown through acquiring industry-leading brands, bringing together teams from 42+ nationalities, 20+ countries, and 10+ brands. Instead of enforcing a one-size-fits-all culture, we embrace unique perspectives, different working styles, and localized expertise to drive global innovation.

We are a fully remote, async-friendly company where transparency, open communication, and collaborative problem-solving define how we work. Whether you thrive in the fast pace of a startup or the stability of an established product, WebPros offers a dynamic, evolving career journey that you can shape based on your strengths.

We are committed to fostering an inclusive, equitable workplace where every team member feels valued, heard, and supported because our diversity is our strength.

Compensation & Benefits

We believe benefits go beyond just perks. At WebPros, we invest in your growth, flexibility, and well-being, so you can do your best work and build a meaningful career. While we strive to provide equal global benefits for all team members, some may vary by location, and we’ll clarify the details with you during the interview process.


Competitive salary
Remote-first flexibility: Work from anywhere in Europe (or hybrid in available offices).
Development Budget: Annual personal growth allowance.
Learning Support: Udemy subscription & peer learning.
Public Transport & Meal Vouchers: Location-dependent benefits.
Paid Time Off: The number of days of annual leave is dependent on your location.
Team Culture: Regular team and on-site company events.


Your Hiring Experience

Hi, I’m Florian, your Talent Partner for EMEA at WebPros. I’ll guide you through the interview process, ensuring a clear, transparent, and meaningful experience. Before moving into talent and culture, I was a software engineer, so I understand what it’s like to navigate technical hiring. My goal is to make this process a genuine, two-way conversation where you feel informed, valued, and empowered to make the best decision for your career.

Hiring is about relationships, not just resumes. You can expect honest, constructive feedback at every step, and I welcome yours as well. No matter the outcome, I want this to be a positive and insightful experience. If you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn.

Interview Process


Screening Interview (30 min): A conversation with Florian to get to know each other, and introduce you to WebPros, our culture, and your potential team. We’ll discuss your motivation, career aspirations, and how your experience aligns with the role while giving you as much insight as possible into what to expect.
Hiring Manager Interview (45 min): Discussion with Tobias to assess team fit, self-reliance, technical alignment, and problem-solving skills.
Technical & Culture Interview (60 min): Deep dive into technical expertise, problem-solving, adaptability, and data handling, followed by a cultural fit discussion with two team members.
Offer Talk (30 min): Final conversation with Tobias and Florian to review offer details and answer any remaining questions.


Our Commitment to a Diverse & Inclusive Culture

At WebPros, we want every team member to feel excited to bring their full, authentic self to work. Our strength lies in the diversity of our people, with different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences driving innovation and making us stronger together.

We are committed to ensuring equitable opportunities, pay, and support for all employees, regardless of identity, background, or circumstances. We foster a culture of belonging, respect, and psychological safety, where everyone feels valued, heard, and empowered to contribute meaningfully and grow.

Discrimination of any kind, including sexism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and ageism, has no place here. By embracing differences and championing inclusivity, we create an environment where everyone can thrive.

We are looking forward to your application!

Best,

Tobias & Florian

Our Distribute and Comply services allow intellectual property owners to focus on their products without needing to build or maintain pharma backbone capabilities. We pick up from manufacturers and deliver to wholesalers and pharmacies, taking care of everything else in between to keep products in supply. We hold marketing authorisations and comply with all regulatory requirements to maintain the highest possible standard of quality and patient safety. And we do this across Europe with the aspiration to expand globally.

Founded in 2019, as part of the Tithonia Group, we have scaled our operations to manage close to 100,000 units per month and 60 marketing authorisations across 25 countries. Our diverse and combined team has more than 30 people across 7 countries, speaking more than 10 languages. We are EBITDA profitable, growing, and are participating in a market that is ripe for new thinking.

At Simple Pharma, our core values— Knowledge and Transparency, Agency, First Principle Thinking & Humility—guide our actions every day. They shape our daily operations and interactions. Whether it's empowering a colleague with the right information, proactively addressing challenges, or embracing feedback, we live these values every day to ensure that Simple Pharma is a place where innovation thrives, and excellence is the norm.

If so, global change communications might be for you. We’re on the lookout for candidates who are interested in the world around them and are passionate about tackling global issues. At M+C Saatchi World Services we are focused on tackling some of humanity’s most challenging and important problems, in fragile states and developing countries, harnessing the power of cutting-edge communications and creativity to achieve long-term behaviour change.


The World Services Internship Programme is a paid 6-week scheme open to anyone looking to start a career in communications, with a focus on global change. It's a data boot camp designed for individuals passionate about the world of data science, data-driven insights and data analysis. Ideal for students or recent graduates, this programme offers the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in a dynamic and forward-thinking environment.

The internship will commence 21 July 2025 and run until 28 August 2025 based in our offices in Soho at regular business hours (9:30am – 6:00pm). Interns will be expected to come into the office at least three times per week at the discretion of their programme leads.

M+C Saatchi World Services will consider scheme graduates for potential employment opportunities. While a job is not guaranteed, the purpose of this program is to invest in potential future talent.

ABOUT THE ROLE

This role offers a unique opportunity to combine collaboration and learning. 

You'll work closely with a senior data scientist, gaining mentorship, guidance, and feedback on your data analysis projects. 
By actively participating in team meetings and project discussions, you'll contribute fresh perspectives and innovative ideas. 
To further develop your technical skillset, you'll undergo comprehensive training in data analysis tools and techniques, including SQL, and dashboarding. 
Finally, you'll master the art of data storytelling, preparing and presenting project reports that effectively communicate findings, methodologies, and results to both technical and non-technical audiences, ultimately impacting company decision-making.
You will be paid London Living Wage.

ABOUT YOU

We are looking for candidates who have:

Curious minds: We want someone who is naturally curious and fascinated by the world and why it is the way it is, particularly from a geo-political perspective. Someone who stops scrolling to read about what’s going on around the world and invests themselves in social issues. Someone who has a belief in the idea that communications, when applied properly, can lead to a better world.
A knack for collaborating: We work jointly with partners and agencies as well as other M&C Saatchi companies to provide support from strategy to implementation for many of our campaigns. We need a natural collaborator. Someone who empowers those around them and is open, willing and able to engage new people inside and outside of our organisation.
A desire for a meaningful career: What gets you out of bed in the morning? Those who are driven by a greater purpose and search for a ‘why’ in what they do will often find commercial careers unfulfilling. We are searching for the people who want their career to mean something.
Technical experience and programmatic ability: Candidates are expected to have the requisite skills to work within a data team. Knowledge of Python is essential, SQL desirable, and wider technical skills are welcomed. Familiarity with version control systems, especially Git, is strongly desirable. Candidates should be comfortable processing, understanding, and drawing insights from large datasets.

As we value curiosity and collaboration, we are looking for individuals who are naturally fascinated by the world and why it is the way it is, particularly from a data-driven perspective. A belief in the power of data and communications to improve the world is a must.

APPLICATION CLOSING DATE: Monday 05 May, 2025*


Successful candidates will be invited for a short video interview in mid-May 2025, or sooner, depending on application volume.

Please note: Internships are offered subject to the provision of a successful background check, and proof of right to work in the United Kingdom.

*We reserve the right to close the application window earlier than stated if necessary.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together.

You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

To do this, we start with our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization.

Data is at the heart of Lyft’s products and decision-making. You will leverage data and rigorous, analytical thinking to shape our products and make business decisions. This will involve performing rigorous product deep dives, identifying opportunities for product enhancements, and measuring the impact of new features.

The Verticals team encompasses 3 critical and unique products / marketplaces within Lyft: airports, scheduled rides, and events. Airports are one of the most important, impactful, and complex parts of Lyft’s Rideshare business, as they are a key part of both the rider and driver Lyft experience and have unique dynamics. Scheduled rides allow riders to book a ride in advance with high reliability, and enable drivers to add structure to their work schedule. Lastly, events such as concerts or sporting games require similar considerations of special operations to ensure a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.

As a Senior Data Analyst on the Verticals team, you will collaborate with engineering, product, design, operations, and marketing to think critically about the current rider and driver experience and implement product enhancements to facilitate market growth. The ideal candidate can apply strong business acumen to propose product and marketplace changes, and is comfortable working with a highly cross functional team. In this role, you will help us tackle problems such as:


Which airports are underperforming and which key metrics can we use to identify and classify airport performance? What targets should we set for these key metrics?
What is driving high cancellation rates today and which types of riders/drivers are cancelling? What product changes can we implement to reduce cancellation rates for scheduled rides?
How are riders and drivers using different ride modes at airports and events, and how do we design products to address this behavior?
How are riders and drivers discovering scheduled rides and are there entry point optimizations we can implement?


Responsibilities:


Leverage data and analytic frameworks to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency across Verticals products, recommending solutions to drive business impact
Understand the complex business dynamics across the Verticals product areas, specifically how these products differ from traditional rideshare marketplaces, to propose enhancements that compliment Lyft-wide products
Partner with product managers, engineers, marketers, designers, and operators to translate data insights into decisions and action
Develop dashboards and analytical frameworks to monitor business and product performance
Establish metrics that measure the health of our products, the business, as well as the rider and driver experiences


Experience:


5-7+ years of experience in data analytics in a high-growth environment
Degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, economics, applied math, operations research or engineering (an asset, advanced degrees also an asset)
End-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, analysis, and visualization
Ability to manage, influence, negotiate, and inspire others in a fast-moving environment
Proficient in SQL and quantitative analysis, you can deep dive into large amounts of data, draw meaningful insights, dissect business issues and draw actionable conclusions
Outcome-driven approach to developing recommendations and demonstrated ability to develop a story and execution plan to support goals and objectives
Exceptional communication (listening, written, and oral) skills with the ability to present findings and recommendations targeted to the audience in question.
A drive to understand the core issues along with the determination to uncover the solution
Thrives within ambiguity and context-switching
Strong oral and written communication skills, and ability to collaborate with cross-functional partners


Benefits:


Extended health and dental coverage options, along with life insurance and disability benefits
Mental health benefits
Family building benefits
Child care and pet benefits
Access to a Lyft funded Health Care Savings Account
RRSP plan to help save for your future

Requirements


5+ years experience in a data-centric role

Significant experience working with large amounts of data (SQL) and a deep understanding of statistical analysis, common quantitative techniques like regression
Experience in data visualization tools (for example, Tableau) and with querying large data lakes (for example, Databricks)
Proven track record of being able to drive work independently and proactively engage with business stakeholders with minimal direction, navigating through ambiguity
Ability to build strong relationships and work cross-functionally with stakeholders in a globally distributed team
Team player with a strong attention to detail and ability to meet tight deadlines
Curious and analytical mindset, with the ability to create compelling narratives and actionable recommendations from their analyses
Strong stakeholder management, up to VP level

At Jane, success means collaborating with your team, delivering an aligned result with efficiency and quality, communicating clearly and openly, and embracing continuous improvement. And guess what?

Compensation Expectations For The Role

Jane’s committed to paying our team members fairly, clearly, and above all, paying for growth. This role has a minimum annual salary of $118,000 and maximum annual salary of $185,500. As you may have noticed, this salary range is quite large, and this is intentional to account for the growth someone will experience in the role throughout their time at Jane (i.e., from building the skills, to accomplished, to highly proficient, all the way to achieving excellence in the role). When hiring talented folks to join the Jane team, we’ve found that new team members are best set up for success when hired with the expectation of being accomplished in the role, which for this role would reflect a starting salary of $141,000.

It's also possible to join Jane at a salary above or below this, which would mean a salary below $141,000 typically reflects someone who has all the potential to be fully accomplished in the role but doesn't yet possess all the skills required, while a salary above $141,000 is typically for individuals who are currently in this role at Jane and had the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on our customers, product and company with deep Jane knowledge. At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.

Paying clearly is one of our compensation fundamentals to help folks build trust in the compensation process at Jane. To better understand Jane’s compensation fundamentals and how this range is determined, click on this link here for a short video walkthrough of how it all works! We also welcome you to ask as many questions as you’d like about compensation throughout the interview process to ensure you feel confident and build trust through the process.

We are funded by the best investors in the world including:

a16z, Sequoia, PayPal, Binance Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Uniswap Labs, Circle Ventures, Delphi Digital, and many more.

About The Role

As we continue to grow at LayerZero, we're faced with an exciting set of challenges: more data, more developers, more teams, more projects, and more opportunities for innovation. To tackle these problems head-on, we're expanding our data team with a dedicated Data Analyst.

As a Data Analyst at LayerZero, you'll be at the forefront of shaping a rich data foundation for a company that's making a real impact in the web3 space. You'll work closely with teams and leaders to uncover insights, drive decision-making, and fuel our next-generation products and services.

Leveraging and expanding our ever-growing Kimball dimensional model.
Writing SQL to create and expand insights in our in-house reporting solutions.

Be a key owner of data quality, building out insights that serve the data team itself to help guide our data efforts towards cleaner and richer data.
Compose pipelines by writing SQL code to clean, combine, refine, and aggregate data into the insights the organization needs.
Collaborating on new datasets to ingest into our Snowflake data warehouse, working closely with data engineers on your team.
Not afraid of pushing code that supports tens of billions of dollars in daily transaction volume.


About You

We are looking for someone with previous data analyst experience. Likely with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Physics or related field, but we also consider and highly value equivalent practical experience.

Required


Strong SQL knowledge and experience
Proven track record in data modeling, statistics, and analytics
Experience working with a broad range of stakeholders
Strong convictions weakly held.
You enjoy working in a fast-paced start-up environment, where you'll need to take initiative and solve problems independently.

To do this, we start with our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization.

Data is at the heart of Lyft’s products and decision-making. You will leverage data and rigorous, analytical thinking to shape our products and make business decisions. This will involve performing rigorous product deep dives, identifying opportunities for product enhancements, and measuring the impact of new features.

The Verticals team encompasses 3 critical and unique products / marketplaces within Lyft: airports, scheduled rides, and events. Airports are one of the most important, impactful, and complex parts of Lyft’s Rideshare business, as they are a key part of both the rider and driver Lyft experience and have unique dynamics. Scheduled rides allow riders to book a ride in advance with high reliability, and enable drivers to add structure to their work schedule. Lastly, events such as concerts or sporting games require similar considerations of special operations to ensure a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.

As a Senior Data Analyst on the Verticals team, you will collaborate with engineering, product, design, operations, and marketing to think critically about the current rider and driver experience and implement product enhancements to facilitate market growth. The ideal candidate can apply strong business acumen to propose product and marketplace changes, and is comfortable working with a highly cross functional team. In this role, you will help us tackle problems such as:


Which airports are underperforming and which key metrics can we use to identify and classify airport performance? What targets should we set for these key metrics?
What is driving high cancellation rates today and which types of riders/drivers are cancelling? What product changes can we implement to reduce cancellation rates for scheduled rides?
How are riders and drivers using different ride modes at airports and events, and how do we design products to address this behavior?
How are riders and drivers discovering scheduled rides and are there entry point optimizations we can implement?

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources
Define and monitor key economic impact metrics
Go deep on understanding business drivers, user segments, cohorts and macroeconomic trends
Prepare presentations, analyses and visualizations for internal and external executive audiences
Partner closely with Communications, Policy, Marketing and Product teams to identify and analyze key trends and produce thought leadership pieces and campaign content leveraging Stripe data
Collaborate with external vendors, academics, and think tanks to advance Stripe’s research agenda and advocacy positions



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

To do this, we start with our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization.

Data is at the heart of Lyft’s products and decision-making. You will leverage data and rigorous, analytical thinking to shape our products and make business decisions. This will involve performing rigorous product deep dives, identifying opportunities for product enhancements, and measuring the impact of new features.

The Verticals team encompasses 3 critical and unique products / marketplaces within Lyft: airports, scheduled rides, and events. Airports are one of the most important, impactful, and complex parts of Lyft’s Rideshare business, as they are a key part of both the rider and driver Lyft experience and have unique dynamics. Scheduled rides allow riders to book a ride in advance with high reliability, and enable drivers to add structure to their work schedule. Lastly, events such as concerts or sporting games require similar considerations of special operations to ensure a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.

As a Senior Data Analyst on the Verticals team, you will collaborate with engineering, product, design, operations, and marketing to think critically about the current rider and driver experience and implement product enhancements to facilitate market growth. The ideal candidate can apply strong business acumen to propose product and marketplace changes, and is comfortable working with a highly cross functional team. In this role, you will help us tackle problems such as:


Which airports are underperforming and which key metrics can we use to identify and classify airport performance? What targets should we set for these key metrics?
What is driving high cancellation rates today and which types of riders/drivers are cancelling? What product changes can we implement to reduce cancellation rates for scheduled rides?
How are riders and drivers using different ride modes at airports and events, and how do we design products to address this behavior?
How are riders and drivers discovering scheduled rides and are there entry point optimizations we can implement?


Responsibilities:


Leverage data and analytic frameworks to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency across Verticals products, recommending solutions to drive business impact
Understand the complex business dynamics across the Verticals product areas, specifically how these products differ from traditional rideshare marketplaces, to propose enhancements that compliment Lyft-wide products
Partner with product managers, engineers, marketers, designers, and operators to translate data insights into decisions and action
Develop dashboards and analytical frameworks to monitor business and product performance
Establish metrics that measure the health of our products, the business, as well as the rider and driver experiences


Experience:


5-7+ years of experience in data analytics in a high-growth environment
Degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, economics, applied math, operations research or engineering (an asset, advanced degrees also an asset)
End-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, analysis, and visualization
Ability to manage, influence, negotiate, and inspire others in a fast-moving environment
Proficient in SQL and quantitative analysis, you can deep dive into large amounts of data, draw meaningful insights, dissect business issues and draw actionable conclusions
Outcome-driven approach to developing recommendations and demonstrated ability to develop a story and execution plan to support goals and objectives
Exceptional communication (listening, written, and oral) skills with the ability to present findings and recommendations targeted to the audience in question.
A drive to understand the core issues along with the determination to uncover the solution
Thrives within ambiguity and context-switching
Strong oral and written communication skills, and ability to collaborate with cross-functional partners

Our Business Intelligence Specialist will enable a data-driven strategy at Resolver by building dashboards and providing insights on key results. This is a role where you will work with stakeholders across the business to define how data impacts our business. The future state is a data-centric culture where leaders are empowered with self-service data for decision-making. You will drive conversations across the company on the insights in our data and how we can use them to improve results.

About Resolver:

Resolver is a high-growth SaaS company whose intuitive, no-code platform gives our customers a clear picture of their risks so they can make quick and effective decisions. As a part of the Resolver team, your work will help transform risk management to risk intelligence so organizations can protect people and assets and deliver on their purpose.

We are ambitious in both our mission and our culture. As a business within Kroll, we offer an innovative, non-hierarchical work environment blended with the stability and financial security of an enterprise. Resolver has also been named one of Canada’s Great Places to Work six years in a row!

What you'll be doing:

Data Analysis (60%)


Serve as a centralized reporting agent for all divisions at Resolver, adjusting monthly reports with updated data sources and resolving issues with current reporting as required
Provide new reporting, dashboards and other visualization to the business that will support growth
Proactively identify trends and business insights that improve results against core corporate KPIs: ARR, win-rate, back-to-base revenue
Collaborate with key stakeholders on division-level reports across services, product, sales, marketing and division leads
Ability to break down complex business challenges, identify root causes and develop data-driven solutions is crucial



Data Management(30%)


Detect data quality issues and their root causes; implement fixes and design data audits to capture the issues in the future
Monitor dashboards to ensure they’re functioning properly. Troubleshoot when issues arise
Maintain standards for key metrics to avoid inconsistency in reporting across dashboards and teams
Make use of historical metrics when setting up reporting, with aim of enabling teams to deliver and exceed on division-level and corporate-level objectives
Write and maintain documentation to support our goal of being a data-centric culture; support data integrity. Document untapped data sources that teams could leverage in future reporting



Strategy (10%)


Regularly report to stakeholders on the business impact of the BI infrastructure and BI-related projects
Understand stakeholder requirements and anticipate future needs as it relates to data and data management
Continuously advance our data culture by researching the market and recommending industry best-practices



What you bring to the table:


3-5 years work experience working with BI tools (e.g. Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Domo).
Expert at building intuitive, well-thought-out dashboards that users love. A keen eye for data visualization and finding elegant solutions for making complex data understandable
2+ years data modelling, analysis, cleaning and QA
Experience with SQL
Post Secondary degree is required



Nice to haves:


Background in analytics, mathematics or another quantitative field would be amazing
Experience with Python or R is a plus. Experience with predictive data analytics and data viz libraries would be a big asset (e.g. Scikit-learn, SciPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Plotly)
Experience with Snowflake would be a major asset, as would experience with CRM data



What we’ll give you in return:

Resolver is one of Canada's Great Workplaces. Culture isn't just something we write about (although we do), we live our values and challenge each other to be our best selves. We invest in Resolverites who will grow with us. We have a comprehensive rewards package to show our team our appreciation for everything they do:

We offer a Career Development Program to help you identify and build your skillsets for internal growth opportunities and beyond. We also have a Coaching Program for all our managers. We know how important it is to have a good boss, so we invest in their development.
Vacation: it's open, which means we don't worry about an accrual clock. On average, we see most folks enjoying between 3-4 weeks off a year.
Parental leave: Best-in-class top-up for new parents - 100% for 15 weeks new parents and a bonus 5 weeks for birth mothers.
RRSP: Matching up to 2.5%

The City of North Vancouver is the urban core of the beautiful North Shore and has a long-term vision to be “The Healthiest Small City in the World”, with five key priorities to be a City for People, a Resilient City, a Vibrant City, a Connected City and a Prosperous City.

The Information Technology department requires a highly driven and innovative Data Analyst to support data initiatives that enhance decision-making and operational effectiveness across municipal services.

Additionally, you will design and develop interactive dashboards, reports, and data visualizations that effectively communicate performance metrics and insights to stakeholders, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Collaboration with cross-functional teams will be essential to understand data requirements and maintain data accuracy, consistency, and integrity. As a subject matter expert in data analytics, you will provide guidance on best practices for data management and analytics while actively exploring emerging technologies in data science to recommend innovative tools that enhance the City’s data analytics and reporting capabilities.

Strong communication skills are crucial for translating complex data into clear, actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders. Familiarity with spatial data, ArcGIS applications within a municipal setting is also a significant asset.

The ideal candidate will have a Bachelor’s degree in computer science, mathematics, statistics, data science, or a related field, plus sound related experience in quantitative data analytics, business intelligence, and data modeling.
