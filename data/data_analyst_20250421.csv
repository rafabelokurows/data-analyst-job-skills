Department Description

The Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care at UCSF provides outstanding patient care, promotes cutting-edge basic and clinical science research, and educates the next generation of healthcare providers while focusing on increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion across the organization.

The Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care ranks as one of the largest departments in the School of Medicine with an annual budget of $145 million. The two largest components of the annual budget are Professional Fee Income and Extramural Funds, representing 90.4% or $132 million (including ZSFG professional fees and 6.9% or $10.1 million of the annual budget respectively. Currently, the department has over 298 Faculty members, 27 Staff Physicians, 205 Staff Employees, 6 Fellows, 90 Residents, 12 Non-Faculty Academics, 11 Post Docs, 68 CRNAs and 5 Nurse Practitioners at ZSFG .

In addition to the Moffitt-Long Hospital, very active units of the department exist at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (inpatient and outpatient, including a very active trauma service), San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (inpatient and outpatient), Mt. Zion Medical Center (outpatient, including 23 hour stays and the Pain Management Center), Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, the UCSF Orthopedic Institute and the Benioff Children's, Betty Irene Moore Women's and Bakar Cancer (NIH-designated Cancer Center) Hospitals in the Mission Bay neighborhood.

The Department now has essential roles in patient care outside of the operating rooms, with active participation in Ambulatory Care, Acute and Chronic Pain, and in the Preoperative Clinic. Over the department’s fifty-plus years of existence, the department has been at the heart of modern anesthesia’s explosive growth, and to this day continues to have an enormous impact on surgical practice and the management of pain. The department’s research, education, and clinical care quickly earned and have maintained reputations that are the equal or better of any institution in the world. Individual members of our faculty have had a major influence on our specialty both nationally and internationally, including NIH study sections, NIH funding, FDA and Editorial Boards. Research activities within this department are integrated with and inform clinical practice. For many years, ours has been among the top departments for NIH research funding in anesthesia in the United States.

The Department of Anesthesia provides considerable support and structure for research in general and, for research training programs, highlighted by the innovative Pathway to Scientific Independence (PSI). This program begins at the residency level, incorporating the Research Scholars Track of the Anesthesia Residency, moving through the post-residency NIH-funded T32 training grant, and faculty positions with a mentored research support, and ultimately to achieving extramurally funded, independent researcher status.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Payment Intelligence Engineering’s purpose is to mitigate threats to our systems in order to keep our merchants, Stripe and financial partners safe. We empower global businesses with intelligent solutions for conversion and fraud prevention, leveraging consumer intelligence and transparent ML to maximize growth and build trust. Our Payments Intelligence portfolio delivers actionable insights to all user segments.

The Payments Health Technical Operations team is pioneering new ways to achieve this mission. Our dynamic team relies on the expertise of integration reliability engineers and data analysts to identify gaps and build comprehensive solutions in the ever changing arena of fraud prevention.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and maintain SQL queries to analyze and navigate complex financial data effectively.
Enhance overall observability by identifying gaps and proposing actionable insights to improve our monitoring systems.
Actively hunt for patterns and anomalies in data that could indicate potential threats or operational issues.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to consolidate and gather relevant data for informed engineering efforts.
Design and implement comprehensive dashboards for real-time visibility into key metrics and system health.
Establish and refine key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress and improvements over time.
Support the creation and maintenance of observability frameworks to ensure early detection of issues.
Contribute to efforts that reduce organizational toil by optimizing data analysis processes.
Communicate findings and insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Stay updated with industry trends in data analysis and financial data handling to ensure best practices.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have 5+ years of experience in Payments at a leading technology or payments company
Have experience writing SQL to query relational databases
Have experience managing communications and workflows with technical and non-technical teams across internal and external stakeholders
Experience mentoring junior team members in technical skill development, operational strategy and problem solving
Have experience navigating the nuanced complexity of financial systems and solving large scale, technical challenges
Have strong financial modeling and analytical skills to investigate, prioritize, and identify the root cause of issues
Have experience managing multiple, concurrent work streams, identifying and triaging technical issues and driving solutions with clear metrics to show impact



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,400 - $219,600. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.

Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.

We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense. We have offices located in the SoHo neighborhood of New York, the Mission District in San Francisco, and Lawrenceville in Pittsburgh.

The Role

Our generative AI-powered products are revolutionizing the practice of medicine, and we’re looking for a highly motivated Senior Data Analyst to join our growing US-based Data Science & BI team. Your work will be instrumental in driving product strategy, directly influencing how healthcare professionals engage with patient data.

What You'll Do

Data Analysis and Insight Generation


Extract meaningful insights and identify trends and patterns relevant to our business and product, by collecting, cleaning, and analyzing internal and external data
Ensure end-to-end visibility and understanding of our AI generation pipelines, from internal quality metrics to automated assessment in production.
Investigate and correct issues identified through data operations monitors, tools, and reports.


Cross-Functional Leadership and Collaboration


Effectively communicate trends and patterns to internal and external stakeholders, by developing and maintaining live dashboards
Serve as a domain expert for the business context of our analytics data, sharing your understanding of the assumptions and limitations of our business metrics.
Continually enhance our understanding of the business and product, by identifying and filling gaps in our data sources. This includes working closely with multidisciplinary teams such as product, engineering, partner success, and the executive team.


Who You Are


8+ years of experience in Data Analytics, BI or a related field, ideally at a product-focused software company.
Expert-level SQL skills with proficiency in writing efficient queries on large and complex data sets.
Understanding of database technology and experience with a cloud SQL data warehouse (e.g. BigQuery, Postgres, Snowflake)
Experience in analytical data modeling and schema design
Experience with a data visualization tool (e.g. Tableau, Looker, Sigma)


Data Advocate


Excellent communicator capable of effectively delivering quantitative findings to non-technical stakeholders in a clear and compelling fashion.
A team player, comfortable assisting others across the organization in solving data problems and answering questions with data
Passionate about data quality, with a keen interest in data drill down and problem-solving
Ability to prioritize amidst changing priorities in a fast moving environment


Domain-relevant Knowledge


Knowledge of healthcare settings, electronic health records (EHR), and healthcare billing are all a plus
Experience with common approaches to measure and drive user engagement is a plus


Base Salary: $153,000 USD - $189,000 USD per year + Equity

The salary range provided is based on transparent pay guidelines and is an estimate for candidates residing in the San Francisco Bay area. The actual base salary will vary depending on the candidate's location, relevant experience, skills, qualifications, and other job-related factors. Additionally, this role may include the opportunity to participate in a company stock option plan as part of the total compensation package.

Must be willing to work from our SF office at least 3x per week

This position requires a commitment to a hybrid work model, with the expectation of coming into the office a minimum of (3) three times per week. Relocation assistance is available for candidates willing to move to San Francisco.

We value people who are eager to learn new things and recognize that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.

Why work at Abridge?

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

How we take care of Abridgers:


Generous Time Off: 13 paid holidays, flexible PTO for salaried employees, and accrued time off for hourly employees.
Comprehensive Health Plans: Medical, Dental, and Vision plans for all full-time employees. Abridge covers 100% of the premium for you and 75% for dependents. If you choose a HSA-eligible plan, Abridge also makes monthly contributions to your HSA.
Paid Parental Leave: 16 weeks paid parental leave for all full-time employees.
401k and Matching: Contribution matching to help invest in your future.
Pre-tax Benefits: Access to Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) and Commuter Benefits.
Learning and Development Budget: Yearly contributions for coaching, courses, workshops, conferences, and more.
Sabbatical Leave: 30 days of paid Sabbatical Leave after 5 years of employment.
Compensation and Equity: Competitive compensation and equity grants for full time employees.
... and much more!


Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying safe - Protect yourself from recruitment fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article. Please exercise caution and cease communications if something feels suspicious about your interactions.

The role

As part of our mission to scale end-to-end embodied AI for autonomous driving, we are building a world-class Data Management team focused on unlocking high-quality, targeted data acquisition that drives model performance and predictability. We are looking for a highly analytical and systems-minded ODD & Behavioral Competency Analyst to lead the analysis of Operational Design Domains (ODDs), traffic patterns, and regulatory behaviors across our target markets.

This role will be critical in defining what data is needed, where, and how much, in order to build models with high Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and generalization capabilities across varied geographies.

Key Responsibilities


Analyze and define the operational design domain (ODD) for each target market or region, including geography, infrastructure, weather, road types, traffic density, and local driving behaviors.
Identify ODD boundaries, edge conditions, and failure triggers to inform data collection and system design.
Build and maintain a taxonomy of behavioral competencies (e.g., merging, yielding, unprotected turns, interacting with pedestrians) required to safely operate in each ODD.
Quantify the complexity and frequency of each competency based on local traffic data, regulations, and real-world observations.
Develop a framework to compute and prioritize permutations of ODD parameters and behavioral competencies to optimize data collection, scenario coverage, and scaling efficiency.
Recommend minimal data slices needed to support safe and predictable system performance in a new region.
Analyze traffic laws, enforcement patterns, and common driving behaviors in new markets to assess differences in required system behavior and edge case risks.
Collaborate with legal and safety teams to map regulations to system-level behavioral expectations.
Work closely with data engineering, safety, simulation, product, and deployment teams to turn ODD and competency insights into actionable data strategies and deployment plans.
Provide input to scenario library development, synthetic data generation, and test case prioritization.
Use historical data and statistical models to identify data gaps or high-variance behaviors that impact MTBF performance.
Provide guidance on what additional data is needed to reach MTBF targets in each ODD segment.


About You

In order to set you up for success as a Data Analyst at Wayve, we’re looking for the following skills and experience.

Essential


Strong background in systems engineering, transportation analysis, data science, or a related field.
Proven experience with traffic system modeling, autonomous driving deployment, or urban mobility analysis.
Experience analyzing or defining ODDs in the context of AV/ADAS technologies is a strong plus.
Familiarity with traffic regulations and human driving behaviors across multiple geographies.
Proficiency in data analysis tools (e.g., Python, SQL, GIS, Jupyter) and ability to visualize ODD and scenario coverage metrics.
Ability to work cross-functionally and translate domain analysis into technical and product requirements.
Experience working in an agile, fast-scaling environment with a strong execution mindset.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Payment Intelligence Engineering’s purpose is to mitigate threats to our systems in order to keep our merchants, Stripe and financial partners safe. We empower global businesses with intelligent solutions for conversion and fraud prevention, leveraging consumer intelligence and transparent ML to maximize growth and build trust. Our Payments Intelligence portfolio delivers actionable insights to all user segments.

The Payments Health Technical Operations team is pioneering new ways to achieve this mission. Our dynamic team relies on the expertise of integration reliability engineers and data analysts to identify gaps and build comprehensive solutions in the ever changing arena of fraud prevention.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and maintain SQL queries to analyze and navigate complex financial data effectively.
Enhance overall observability by identifying gaps and proposing actionable insights to improve our monitoring systems.
Actively hunt for patterns and anomalies in data that could indicate potential threats or operational issues.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to consolidate and gather relevant data for informed engineering efforts.
Design and implement comprehensive dashboards for real-time visibility into key metrics and system health.
Establish and refine key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress and improvements over time.
Support the creation and maintenance of observability frameworks to ensure early detection of issues.
Contribute to efforts that reduce organizational toil by optimizing data analysis processes.
Communicate findings and insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Stay updated with industry trends in data analysis and financial data handling to ensure best practices.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have 5+ years of experience in Payments at a leading technology or payments company
Have experience writing SQL to query relational databases
Have experience managing communications and workflows with technical and non-technical teams across internal and external stakeholders
Experience mentoring junior team members in technical skill development, operational strategy and problem solving
Have experience navigating the nuanced complexity of financial systems and solving large scale, technical challenges
Have strong financial modeling and analytical skills to investigate, prioritize, and identify the root cause of issues
Have experience managing multiple, concurrent work streams, identifying and triaging technical issues and driving solutions with clear metrics to show impact



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,400 - $219,600. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Want to make an impact? Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.




We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.




Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, we work closely with our teams in Barcelona, San Antonio, Spokane, and remote locations. We’ve got a reputation for being a great place to work, having been named among the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Seattle Business Magazine and Washington’s Best Workplaces in the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies.




At Rover, our furry coworkers are just as important as our human ones—and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Along with making the joys of pet parenthood more accessible, we’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community of pet people—and that starts with our employees.




Who we're looking for:

The Marketing Analytics team supports the company’s marketing efforts, while also working with teams throughout the organization. The analytics team is responsible for a number of business-critical reports and data models that our global marketing teams rely on for daily reporting, budgeting, and analysis. We measure marketing attribution to understand how people become Rover customers, provide campaign reporting to monitor trends in cost efficiency and optimization, deliver lifecycle data to action against a variety of customer behaviors, and narrate the business to identify and prioritize new opportunities.




We are looking for an Analyst to support our Growth, International Expansion, Lifecycle, and SEO stakeholders with a focus on improving our reporting and dashboard structure. The ideal candidate will have experience working closely with business stakeholders and building data-driven narratives that enable clear decision making.

Work closely with analytics peers and marketing teams to narrate trends and insights, with a particular focus on our customer acquisition marketing programs.
Design reports and dashboards that enable clear, data-driven decision-making for marketing and cross-functional teams.
Refine our marketing attribution models to drive optimal resource allocation across paid and organic marketing channels.
Expand your expertise by supporting experiments such as A/B testing and Market Match tests to optimize strategies across multiple marketing functions.




Your Qualifications:

At least 2 years experience working with complex datasets to support business decision making.
Fluency in SQL.
Data visualisation tool experience (e.g. Mode, Looker, Tableau, etc.)
Ability to adapt your communication style to translate complex data insights for different audiences.
You have experience in owning small-to-medium projects from design to completion with limited guidance from your manager.
You understand when you are blocked, proactively seeking out for help within the team or the organization to move the project forward.




Nice to Have:

Python or R familiarity is helpful, but we welcome candidates eager to develop these skills.
Experience evaluating results of A/B tests as well as expertise in statistical analysis.
Understanding of marketing metrics such as clicks, CPC, CTR, impressions, and unit economics like customer LTV, payback period, and CAC.




Benefits of working at Rover:

Competitive compensation
Long-term incentive plan with a company performance-based cash payout
Permanent contract
Pension Plan
Meal tickets through Cobee
Generous PTO Allowance
Hybrid schedule
Private health insurance
Discounted Gym Membership
Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time)
Monetary help for adopting a dog plus yearly credit to use on our platform

Summary

About us

Cristóbal Balenciaga founded the House in 1917 in his home of Spain. In 1937, he established the brand in Paris, designing its collections there until 1968.

The ultra-modern shapes were trademarks of the house.While the brand’s identity is firmly rooted in its highly conceptual prêt-à-porter collections, its leather goods, footwear, and accessories experience worldwide success as well. Among the archetypal products of the House are its handbag collections. A new focus on the development of Balenciaga ready-to-wear collections for men was quickly established as highly successful.Since October 2015, Demna has designed both men’s and women’s collections as the artistic director.The Balenciaga House, part of the Kering group since 2001, is one of the most influential names in fashion.
