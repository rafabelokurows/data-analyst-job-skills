Zur Verstärkung unseres Teams in Deutschland suchen wir dich zum nächstmöglichen Zeitpunkt als Data Analyst für Healthcare Analytics.

Das Healthcare Analytics Team nutzt Analysen und Daten aus dem Gesundheitswesen (z.B. Krankenversicherungen oder Gesundheitseinrichtungen), um einige der dringendsten Herausforderungen unserer Klienten zu beantworten, wie zum Beispiel „Wie können wir die Kosten der Gesundheitsversorgung optimieren und gleichzeitig die Qualität verbessern?“, „Wie können wir mit KI/ML Prozesse optimieren und bspw. Rechnungsbetrug automatisiert erkennen?“, „Wer sind die sensibelsten Patientengruppen und mit welchen Behandlungspfaden können wir ihre Versorgung verbessern?“

Healthcare Analytics ist ein Team innerhalb der SHaPE-Practice (Social, Healthcare and Public Entities) mit Fokus auf der spezialisierten Beratung von Einrichtungen des Gesundheitswesens, insbesondere Kostenträgern.

Deine täglichen Aufgaben umfassen die Analyse und Modellierung großer Datensätze sowie die enge Zusammenarbeit mit unseren Data Engineers beim Aufbau und der Pflege unserer McKinsey Big Data Plattform. Du wirst Dashboards und ML/KI-Modelle entwickeln, wobei du sowohl Low-Code/No-Code-Tools als auch Python und Visualisierungstools nutzen kannst. Im täglichen Geschäft arbeitest du eng mit unseren Data Engineering Kollegen, dem Capabilities and Insights Team sowie unseren Beratungsteams zusammen, um die Kundenarbeit vorzubereiten und durchzuführen.

Getreu unserem Motto – People is what makes us us – sind uns deine nachhaltige Ausbildung und Weiterentwicklung, deine ausgeglichene Work-Life-Balance und deine Happiness sehr wichtig. Konkret stellen wir mit 32 Urlaubstagen, 60 % mobilem Arbeiten, bis zu 4 Wochen pro Jahr – im europäischen Ausland – der Möglichkeit remote zu arbeiten, Sabbatical und Überstundenausgleich sicher, dass dir im FUSE-Agentur-Leben nichts fehlt.

In unserem derzeit über 60-köpfigen Team sowie unseren Kund*innen haben wir unser perfektes Match bereits gefunden. Wenn du noch auf der Suche bist, bei „popkulturellem Relevanzmarketing“ neugierig wirst und für Social Media, Influencer Marketing oder Gaming & Esports brennst, dann lass uns zusammen loslegen! Denn : Action Creates Impact .

Dein Job

Als (Junior) Insights Analyst (mensch) bearbeitest du als Teil unseres Data und Analytics Teams in erster Linie die Anfragen unserer Kunden nach Social Media Reportings sowie Social Listening Analysen und beherrschst den Spagat zwischen analytischem und kreativem Denken, um die Kolleg:Innen in deinem und anderen Teams mit datenbasierten Insights zu Kundenmeinungen, Märkten, Zielgruppen, Marken und ihren Social Media-Umfeldern zu versorgen.

Dein Aufgabenbereich

Datenbeschaffung / Toolbedienung

Du bist präzise, schnell, zuverlässig und motiviert, wenn es um die manuelle Erfassung großer (Social Media)- Datenmengen geht, aber auch wissbegierig und begeisterungsfähig, dich diesbezüglich kontinuierlich mit Prozessoptimierung zu befassen, sowie dich in Tools und automatisierte Datenerfassungsprozesse und Methoden einzudenken, um immer bessere Lösungen zu finden.

Datenstrukturierung, Effiziente Datensammlung, Query Writing, Kategorisierung und Datendarstellung werden hier deine täglichen Begleiter.

Studiendurchführung

Von der (manchmal noch recht schwammigen) Fragestellung bis zum fertigen Analysebericht mit guten Insights und Handlungsempfehlungen ist es oft ein weiter aber spannender Weg. Der kann bald auch deiner sein, gemeinsam mit uns im Team.

Du hast ein sehr gutes Gespür für Sprache und Kommunikation? Nice, das brauchst du hier in mindestens dreierlei Hinsicht: Erstens, um aus den Aussagen und Briefings unserer Auftraggeber herausfiltern zu können, wie du ihnen am besten weiterhelfen kannst. Zweitens, wenn es darum geht, die Essenz von Konsumenten-Posts und Kommentaren auf Social Media zu verstehen, schließlich ist Inhaltanalyse unser Daily-Business. Und Drittens, um dann Deine Findings Zielgruppengerecht rüberzubringen - in Reports, in Meetings und bei Präsentationen.

Datenanalyse

Auswertungslogiken passend zu den gegebenen Fragestellungen und Erkenntnisinteressen erstellen, Dimensionierungen & Kategorisierungen für Inhaltsanalysen planen und entwickeln, Daten auszählen, filtern, darstellen, vergleichen, interpretieren, daraus kreative Idee und Empfehlungen ableiten. Das ist dein Playground. Deine Affinität zu Zahlen und Daten kannst du hier immer wieder beweisen. Ein stets strukturiertes Vorgehen und ein souveräner Umgang auch mit großen und komplexen Datenmengen, Statistiken und Zahlen sind für dich selbstverständlich.

Spezielle Social Media Analyse-Tools wirst Du ebenso (kennenlernen und) zum Einsatz bringen wie ganz viel Excel und das gute alte Powerpoint.

Das bringst du mit

Du kannst (erste) Erfahrung in der qualitativen und quantitativen Forschungsarbeit, sowie in der marketing- oder kundenorientierten Projektarbeit vorweisen und hast Lust dich im Bereich Social Media Analytics weiter auszutoben. Du hast, dank deines Studiums, einen kommunikations-, sozial- oder medienwissenschaftlichen Background und bringst Kenntnisse der Methoden im Bereich der quantitativen und qualitativen Marktforschung mit. Du hast neben den analytischen Fähigkeiten, auch ein Gespür für gute kreative Kommunikation und Lust, diese mitzuentwickeln. Du bist organisiert und selbständig, willst aber auch noch ständig ganz viel lernen und verstehst dich als Teamplayer, der immer auf Höhe des Zeitgeists ist und daraus neue Impulse für unsere Teams und Kunden ableitet. Außerdem hast Du sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse in Wort und Schrift, sehr gute MS Office Kenntnisse, insbesondere Excel und PowerPoint und bist im besten Fall mit Analytics Tools im Bereich Social Listening & Web Analytics vertraut.

Darum wir

Als Teil der FUSE erfährst du stets Rückenwind von deinem Team, arbeitest für Kunden - die unsere Werte „BOLD. TRUE. EASY. TOGETHER.“ leben und kannst aktiv Prozesse und Strukturen mitentwickeln. Denn ganz getreu unserem Wert TOGETHER setzen wir auf das Potential im Team. Neben unvergesslichen Events bieten wir dir viel Raum für persönliche und berufliche Weiterentwicklung.

If so, global change communications might be for you. We’re on the lookout for candidates who are interested in the world around them and are passionate about tackling global issues. At M+C Saatchi World Services we are focused on tackling some of humanity’s most challenging and important problems, in fragile states and developing countries, harnessing the power of cutting-edge communications and creativity to achieve long-term behaviour change.


The World Services Internship Programme is a paid 6-week scheme open to anyone looking to start a career in communications, with a focus on global change. It's a data boot camp designed for individuals passionate about the world of data science, data-driven insights and data analysis. Ideal for students or recent graduates, this programme offers the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in a dynamic and forward-thinking environment.

The internship will commence 21 July 2025 and run until 28 August 2025 based in our offices in Soho at regular business hours (9:30am – 6:00pm). Interns will be expected to come into the office at least three times per week at the discretion of their programme leads.

M+C Saatchi World Services will consider scheme graduates for potential employment opportunities. While a job is not guaranteed, the purpose of this program is to invest in potential future talent.

ABOUT THE ROLE

This role offers a unique opportunity to combine collaboration and learning. 

You'll work closely with a senior data scientist, gaining mentorship, guidance, and feedback on your data analysis projects. 
By actively participating in team meetings and project discussions, you'll contribute fresh perspectives and innovative ideas. 
To further develop your technical skillset, you'll undergo comprehensive training in data analysis tools and techniques, including SQL, and dashboarding. 
Finally, you'll master the art of data storytelling, preparing and presenting project reports that effectively communicate findings, methodologies, and results to both technical and non-technical audiences, ultimately impacting company decision-making.
You will be paid London Living Wage.

ABOUT YOU

We are looking for candidates who have:

Curious minds: We want someone who is naturally curious and fascinated by the world and why it is the way it is, particularly from a geo-political perspective. Someone who stops scrolling to read about what’s going on around the world and invests themselves in social issues. Someone who has a belief in the idea that communications, when applied properly, can lead to a better world.
A knack for collaborating: We work jointly with partners and agencies as well as other M&C Saatchi companies to provide support from strategy to implementation for many of our campaigns. We need a natural collaborator. Someone who empowers those around them and is open, willing and able to engage new people inside and outside of our organisation.
A desire for a meaningful career: What gets you out of bed in the morning? Those who are driven by a greater purpose and search for a ‘why’ in what they do will often find commercial careers unfulfilling. We are searching for the people who want their career to mean something.
Technical experience and programmatic ability: Candidates are expected to have the requisite skills to work within a data team. Knowledge of Python is essential, SQL desirable, and wider technical skills are welcomed. Familiarity with version control systems, especially Git, is strongly desirable. Candidates should be comfortable processing, understanding, and drawing insights from large datasets.

As we value curiosity and collaboration, we are looking for individuals who are naturally fascinated by the world and why it is the way it is, particularly from a data-driven perspective. A belief in the power of data and communications to improve the world is a must.

APPLICATION CLOSING DATE: Monday 05 May, 2025*


Successful candidates will be invited for a short video interview in mid-May 2025, or sooner, depending on application volume.

Please note: Internships are offered subject to the provision of a successful background check, and proof of right to work in the United Kingdom.

*We reserve the right to close the application window earlier than stated if necessary.

And we do this across Europe with the aspiration to expand globally.

Founded in 2019, as part of the Tithonia Group, we have scaled our operations to manage close to 100,000 units per month and 60 marketing authorisations across 25 countries. Our diverse and combined team has more than 30 people across 7 countries, speaking more than 10 languages. We are EBITDA profitable, growing, and are participating in a market that is ripe for new thinking.

At Simple Pharma, our core values— Knowledge and Transparency, Agency, First Principle Thinking & Humility—guide our actions every day. They shape our daily operations and interactions. Whether it's empowering a colleague with the right information, proactively addressing challenges, or embracing feedback, we live these values every day to ensure that Simple Pharma is a place where innovation thrives, and excellence is the norm.

Hi, I’m Tobias, Director of Data Analytics at WebPros, and your future manager. With nearly 20 years of experience in the hosting industry as a developer and BI analyst, I joined WebPros over seven years ago as a data scientist. Throughout my time at WebPros, I initially contributed as a developer and later transitioned into a leadership role, helping to create a comprehensive reporting infrastructure that serves the entire organization.

This role is all about impact. We are looking for a Data Analyst to help us derive actionable insights and enhance data-driven decision-making. If you love autonomy, problem-solving, and working in an async-first, globally distributed team, this is an exciting opportunity to shape the future of our data analytics infrastructure.

You’ll thrive in this role if you’re comfortable navigating data landscapes, driving projects independently, and collaborating across teams to translate business needs into suitable reports and dashboards. If you’re excited about solving reporting challenges with SQL, Looker, and cloud technologies, you’ll find a great home here.

Below, you’ll find everything you need to decide if this role is right for you. From our culture and work style to the specifics of the position and hiring process. We believe in transparency, so we’ve put in the effort to give you a real, inside look at what it’s like to work here.

About WebPros

Whether you prefer working from a bustling city hub or a quiet home office, we enable our teams to thrive from anywhere while staying deeply connected through our strong collaborative culture.

Your Role

We are looking for a remote Data Analyst to help design, build, and optimize our reporting infrastructure. You will work with Google BigQuery, SQL, Looker Studio and similar reporting tools to develop interactive and insightful dashboards, build data models, and deliver data-driven insights.

Your Impact In The First 180 Days

We don’t believe in endless checklists of requirements. Instead, here’s what success looks like in your first 6 months:


30 Days: Get fully onboarded and familiarize yourself with our data infrastructure. Connect with stakeholders across teams to understand potential data needs and identify opportunities for improving current reporting, while also recognizing efficient practices.
60 Days: Deploy your first production-ready updates. Collaborate with the members of the analytics and engineering teams to experiment with dashboard optimizations that enhance reliability and incorporate best practices.
120 Days: You are ready to deploy new dashboards, which involves collaborating with business users, stakeholders, and data source owners. Additionally, you are familiar with the data infrastructure across the organisation and ready to understand the reporting needs of the business.
After 180 Days: You have become an invaluable member of the data analytics team. You have made a significant impact by introducing solutions that enhance the efficiency of dashboards and reporting and improve data quality and monitoring capabilities.


By this point, you won’t just be executing tasks. You’ll be making strategic contributions, improving how we report and share data across the organization, and positioning yourself as a key player in our Data & AI team.

You’ll Thrive Here If You


Have strong experience in dashboarding and reporting, general data analytics, SQL, along with experience in cloud providers such as Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure.
Can independently apply these skills to real-world challenges.
Take ownership of projects from concept to deployment, proactively solving problems and driving impact.
Enjoy working in an async-first, globally distributed team that values autonomy and deep work.
Excel in fast-paced environments where cross-functional collaboration is key to success.


You Might Struggle Here If You


Prefer highly structured roles with rigid processes and step-by-step workflows.
Find it challenging to navigate ambiguity or adapt to changing priorities.
Require constant guidance rather than taking initiative and driving your own work.
Are seeking an entry-level position with extensive hands-on mentorship.

Your Hiring Experience

Hi, I’m Florian, your Talent Partner for EMEA at WebPros. I’ll guide you through the interview process, ensuring a clear, transparent, and meaningful experience.

Hiring is about relationships, not just resumes. You can expect honest, constructive feedback at every step, and I welcome yours as well. No matter the outcome, I want this to be a positive and insightful experience. If you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn.

Interview Process


Screening Interview (30 min): A conversation with Florian to get to know each other, and introduce you to WebPros, our culture, and your potential team.

We are committed to ensuring equitable opportunities, pay, and support for all employees, regardless of identity, background, or circumstances.

We are looking forward to your application!

Best,

Tobias & Florian

East London (Hybrid - 3 days per week)
£40,000 - £55,000 DOE

We're working with a fast-moving, customer-focused telco brand looking to bring in two Data Analysts - one more junior, one more mid-level - to help drive insight across their commercial and customer landscape.

This is a great opportunity for someone with solid SQL skills who wants hands-on experience, meaningful projects, and genuine growth opportunities (with a clear path to promotion over the next 12-24 months). You'll be working closely with a hands-on Head of Analytics, senior stakeholders, and cross-functional teams across the business.

The Role

Handle ad-hoc data pulls and reporting requests

Take ownership of dashboarding (Power BI), and improve visualisation/reporting processes

Deep dive into customer data - churn analysis, CLV projects, marketing campaign performance

Collaborate with commercial, marketing, and country teams on strategic projects (e.g. handset launches, global campaign success)

Help improve data quality across the business and support wider insight efforts

Present findings to senior stakeholders, including finance and country managers

What They're Looking For

SQL is essential - window functions, joins, aggregations for the mid-level role

Strong business acumen and commercial thinking

Experience in customer/marketing analytics or a real desire to develop in that space

Bonus: Power BI, Python, exposure to presenting insights to non-technical audiences

Personality and mindset matter - curiosity, drive, and a collaborative approach are key

Salary

Junior Analyst: £40,000-£45,000

Mid-Level Analyst: Up to £55,000

Interview Process

Stage 1: Informal 30-min Teams chat with the Head of Analytics

Stage 2: Presentation round + Q&A with the team

Optional sign-off with a senior stakeholder

This is an exciting chance to step into a role with visibility, variety, and loads of room to grow. Let us know if you'd like to hear more.

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

YOUR ROLE

In the Data Analytics team you will ensure both the voice of the customer and CFO are represented in the room with hard evidence. As well as supporting exceptional customer experiences using data, you will help ensure every action we take is directly improving performance against your clients objectives.

As an Analyst, you will work under supervision to deliver projects within set deadlines, utilising your strong hands on analytical capabilities. Your strengths in Python and SQL will ensure you can efficiently deliver robust analytics with guidance from your team.

Your experience with web and social analytics tools (GA / Adobe / Brandwatch / Sprinklr) and data visualisation tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker / etc) will enable you to uncover key insights across channels and create self-service dashboards.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

At Zego, we understand that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't reflect how well you actually drive. Since 2016, we have been on a mission to change that by offering the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are the driving force behind everything we do. We've sold tens of millions of policies and raised over $200 million in funding. And we're only just getting started.


Overview of team

The mission of the BI & Analytics team at Zego is to deliver relevant and reliable information to the right people at the right time, enabling rapid and effective decision-making supported by data.  It is a small and dynamic team, responsible for all the aspects related to data, including making data available, data cleaning, extraction, problem formulation and definition of success metrics, reporting and analytics.


About the Role

We are seeking a passionate Senior Business Intelligence Analyst with a strong commercial mindset and a genuine love for data. This role isn't just about surfacing numbers- it's about transforming data into meaningful insights that support strategic decisions. You'll play a pivotal role in enabling teams across the business to make informed, data-driven decisions.

To thrive in this role, you'll need a solid technical foundation in analytics, strong stakeholder management skills, and the ability to operate in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.



What you will be doing

You will collaborate closely with the Data, Engineering, Product, Marketing, Customer Experience, Pricing, Claims & Fraud teams, and senior leadership to identify and evaluate the primary KPIs influencing conversion and performance

You will monitor business performance regularly, conduct ad-hoc analyses, and proactively offer recommendations to Senior Leaders to enhance team performance while identifying growth opportunities or business risks

You will own reporting - set up and maintain reports and dashboards using various technical tools (SQL, Looker, Excel, etc.) to assess KPIs and track them over time

You will be responsible for making data available to internal and external stakeholders in a digestible form. This might include designing and create appropriate ETL processes and partnering with the Data Analytics and Data Engineering teams to implement them

You will work closely with Customer Support, Product and Engineering teams to help prioritise new products and features with the aim of constantly improving the customer experience. Your recommendations will be data-driven, influenced by consumer behaviour, revenue impact, ROI and market trends

You will provide support for modeling and forecasting to comprehend the efforts required to achieve business targets


About you

You have experience in the insurance industry, with a strong understanding of how commercial and insurance metrics connect- including how claims flow and underwriting performance impact business outcome

You've worked in Analytics or BI teams, acting as a true partner to the business- reporting, analysing, and turning data into meaningful insights.

You're comfortable building dashboards (we use Looker) and have advanced Excel skills. You also have a strong grasp of SQL and how to write efficient, business-relevant queries.

You're a strategic thinker and problem solver who thrives in a fast-paced, dynamic environment- especially when juggling multiple deadlines.

You're curious and growth-oriented- always looking to expand your technical skills, explore different areas of analytics, and take ownership of your development.

You're confident managing stakeholders across varying levels of seniority, able to translate a flood of requests into a clear, prioritised plan and set expectations along the way.

You have a collaborative mindset. You see your work as part of a team effort, and you're equally happy leading your own initiatives or jumping in to support others

Bonus points

BS/BA in Mathematics, Engineering, Finance, Economics, or similar
Familiarity with Python or R
Previous experience in a rapidly growing startup, InsurTech, or FinTech
Prior experience in developing ETL processes and financial modeling

Our story - continued commitment to doing the right thing

2005 seems like a long time ago. Simply Business - a small company with a big idea. To transform the way that other small businesses could get the insurance that they need. To reduce time, hassle and jargon wherever possible while introducing the simplicity, choice and value that small businesses are entitled to. To protect them from harm. To keep their livelihoods safe. And to do all this with the promise of positive service. Delivered by happy people, working flexibly, learning constantly. With a restlessly innovative spirit. Within a business committed to doing the right thing. All of the time.

As we’ve grown, we’ve tried hard to keep true to this. To ourselves, to our 800 strong team and to the 3.5m customers that we’ve served so far.

Protecting and serving businesses across the UK and the US. From barbers to bakers, consultants to cleaners, they are the backbone of the economy.

And we’ll continue to stand by them. Bit by bit helping their dreams grow, just like ours.

The Benefits

There’s all the serious (but important) stuff we call “core benefits” and a salary that reflects your experience, our pay policy and the market we’re in from your first day is a global approach. However, some of our “core benefits” differ from the UK to the US to keep us competitive.

These range from life cover, a cash plan and a stakeholder pension in the UK to medical, dental, vision, and prescription drug coverage, short and long term disability, life insurance coverage and participation in 401(k) plan with a 3% employer match in the US.

The Fun stuff!

We are really proud of our culture at SB and that reflects in how our benefits roll. Flexible benefits and working, plenty of training to help you develop your career and loads of clubs to get involved in from trivia nights, guest speakers, and charity drives keep us all well connected. And, the great thing is being remote hasn’t stopped us one bit.

📍West London (3 days a week on-site)

💸£55,000 – £60,000




About the Company

A leading name in the UK property sector is on the hunt for a mid-level Data Analyst to join their growing data team. With a strong foundation in Business Intelligence and a forward-thinking approach to tech, this company has spent the last five years investing heavily in their data infrastructure and are now gearing up to take things even further — including AI implementation over the next 6–12 months. 🚀




They're working on internal data projects with real commercial impact and are looking for someone who can not only crunch the numbers, but also tell the story behind them.




The Role

You’ll take the lead on key analytics initiatives, working end-to-end across data pipelines, visualisation, and stakeholder communication. It’s a hands-on role with plenty of variety — perfect for someone who enjoys making sense of messy data and translating that into insight that drives decisions.




You'll also play a key part in their early AI-driven projects, focused on improving sales processes and customer interactions through transcript analysis and intelligent feedback tools.




What You’ll Be Doing

📈 Lead dashboard development using Power BI, delivering enterprise-grade reports that drive business insight
🔍 End-to-end data analysis, from extraction and transformation to insight using SQL and Python
🗣️ Present findings to stakeholders across all levels, breaking down complex analysis into clear, commercial terms
👥 Run workshops/training to help non-technical users engage with dashboards and tools
🤖 Contribute to AI initiative, including mining sales call data, building feedback prompts, and extracting insights from customer conversations




The Ideal Candidate

Has spent a few years working in data-focused roles, with solid hands-on experience in real-world commercial environments.
Brings a strong academic foundation, ideally in a technical or numerical subject such as Maths, Physics, Engineering, or Computer Science.
Comfortable owning projects end-to-end, from working with raw data to presenting insights that drive business decisions.
A confident communicator who can explain complex analysis in a simple, engaging way.
Technically fluent with Power BI, SQL, and Python, and eager to work with modern tools like Fabric and Copilot.
Curious, analytical, and thrives in a fast-paced, collaborative setting.




💡 This role is ideal for someone looking to step into a more visible, hands-on position where they can shape how data is used across a business — and get early exposure to AI innovation in a real-world commercial setting.

Let’s kick things off with a quick intro. Jane is a team that’s all about fostering growth, spreading delight, and serving our healthcare community. We’re looking for people who are ready to jump in and join us as we simplify the lives of healthcare practitioners and patients every day.

At Jane, success means collaborating with your team, delivering an aligned result with efficiency and quality, communicating clearly and openly, and embracing continuous improvement. And guess what? Jane is a remote-first company, so every role, including this one, gives you the freedom to work from anywhere in Canada.

Your Role In Our Journey

Jane is looking for a Senior Data Analyst who will be responsible for delivering consistent, meaningful insights across the company with a focus on supporting our Marketing team. You will have strong experience with SQL, dbt, Looker and preferably experience in a fast growing software company. We're looking for someone who thrives in a fast-paced environment, enjoys working with stakeholders to solve business problems, and is excited about working with data that drives business impact. You’ll have the opportunity to shape how Jane uses data to improve product adoption, customer retention, and marketing efficiency. At Jane, we value transparency, ownership, and a problem-solving mindset. If you’re excited about working with data to unlock business insights and help shape decision-making, this could be the perfect role for you.

Learn More About Us

We're founder-led, which means we live our values while maintaining a clear vision for the future. Our product enables the likes of physiotherapists, mental health counsellors, chiropractors, and other allied health practitioners to run their practices in a digital-first way through features such as online booking, charting, scheduling, telehealth, secure payments and billing along with an evolving library of features. You can see more of them here .

We're a company that is growing rapidly, and with that comes the challenge of navigating an environment with many moving parts, often without a clear-cut path laid out in front of us. If you're the kind of person who gets a kick out of being resourceful and loves solving problems, we would love to hear from you.

No doubt, Jane's a special place to work. There is autonomy and flexibility to help integrate work into your life in a way that makes sense for you. Need to block out time to pick up the kids? Go for it. That's normal here. And yes, we have a Slack channel for parents, but we've also got channels dedicated to plants, furry friends, food, pride, wellness - you get the idea! While we love to connect virtually, the Jane team also connects in person throughout the year.

We believe in collaboration, humility, and keeping a growth mindset. We're looking for people who can embrace our way of working, which often means being flexible and open to change.

Compensation Expectations For The Role

Jane’s committed to paying our team members fairly, clearly, and above all, paying for growth. This role has a minimum annual salary of $97,600 and maximum annual salary of $152,400. As you may have noticed, this salary range is quite large, and this is intentional to account for the growth someone will experience in the role throughout their time at Jane (i.e., from building the skills, to accomplished, to highly proficient, all the way to achieving excellence in the role). When hiring talented folks to join the Jane team, we’ve found that new team members are best set up for success when hired with the expectation of being fully accomplished in the role, which for this role would reflect a starting salary of $115,900.

It's also possible to join Jane at a salary above or below this, which would mean a salary below $115,900 typically reflects someone who has all the potential to be fully accomplished in the role but doesn't yet possess all the skills required, while a salary above $115,900 is typically for individuals who are currently in this role at Jane and had the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on our customers, product and company with deep Jane knowledge. At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.

Paying clearly is one of our compensation fundamentals to help folks build trust in the compensation process at Jane. To better understand Jane’s compensation fundamentals and how this range is determined, click on this link here for a short video walkthrough of how it all works! We also welcome you to ask as many questions as you’d like about compensation throughout the interview process to ensure you feel confident and build trust through the process.

More information on our benefits can be found here !

At Jane, we’re committed to fostering an environment that allows you to come to work as your truest self. We believe it’s important to actively recognize, embrace, and celebrate our differences in order to make Jane an inclusive, equitable, and diverse workplace.

We want to build a team of people who make conversations rich with perspective and experience. We are committed to listening to every voice in order to learn and grow because doing this will allow us to meet the needs of the diverse community of helpers that Jane serves.

We do not tolerate discrimination, prejudice, or oppressive isms of any kind. Employment is decided on the basis of qualifications, merit, experience, and the needs of the Jane community. We encourage anyone who requires accommodation or adjustments throughout the interview process to let us know, and we will do our best to support you.

At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.<br><br><strong><em>Paying clearly</em></strong><em> is one of our compensation fundamentals to help folks build trust in the compensation process at Jane. To better understand Jane’s compensation fundamentals and how this range is determined, click on this link here for a short video walkthrough of how it all works! We also welcome you to ask as many questions as you’d like about compensation throughout the interview process to ensure you feel confident and build trust through the process.<br><br></em><strong>More information on our benefi</strong>ts can b<strong>e found </strong> <strong>here</strong> <strong>!<br><br></strong>At Jane, we’re committed to fostering an environment that allows you to come to work as your truest self. We believe it’s important to actively recognize, embrace, and celebrate our differences in order to make Jane an inclusive, equitable, and diverse workplace.<br><br>We want to build a team of people who make conversations rich with perspective and experience. We are committed to listening to every voice in order to learn and grow because doing this will allow us to meet the needs of the diverse community of helpers that Jane serves.<br><br>We do not tolerate discrimination, prejudice, or oppressive isms of any kind. Employment is decided on the basis of qualifications, merit, experience, and the needs of the Jane community. We encourage anyone who requires accommodation or adjustments throughout the interview process to let us know, and we will do our best to support you.

Connect data sources (Stripe, CRM, app backend, etc.) to make real-time insights accessible to the team


Tools You Should Know


Must-Have: Stripe Sigma, PostgreSQL, Retool, Google Sheets/Excel
Nice-to-Have: Metabase, Looker Studio, BigQuery, Chartio, Snowflake, Python
Bonus: Experience building dashboards directly in Stripe, using Sigma + external tools


What We’re Looking For


Strong experience querying large datasets with SQL
Solid understanding of SaaS metrics and growth levers
Ability to go from raw data to insights & visuals quickly
Comfortable working async in a fast-paced remote environment


Salary : $20–$25/hr depending on experience

At Search Atlas Group, we are committed to enjoying life as we are to delivering best-in-class services and software. From community volunteer days, socially conscious initiatives, and team lunches and outings, our office reflects our team’s diverse interests.

We’re a growing team of diverse professionals, however, we all share the same goals: to be a part of a company that’s on the edge of digital marketing, to make the world a better place, and to have fun doing it. Our team culture is one of fast-paced innovation, where each person is empowered to take on their own ambitious projects, with the support of their teammates. We’ve got plenty of perks, but the biggest one is working with other energetic high-achievers.

We Are Very Proud Of The Kind, Inclusive, And Collaborative Company Culture We Have Built And Have Been Very Lucky To Be Recognized By Both National And Local Industry Leaders

Here's a Look Into Our Core Values


Collaborative and Highly Engaged


Work is where we invest a big chunk of our lives. And hey, we're all about making that time awesome! Picture this: we're not just coworkers; we're like a squad that's always got each other's backs. We're all about cheering each other on, sharing what we know, and picking each other up when things get messy. Plus, we're big on being real with each other, so there's no room for office drama or gossip. We're all about that good vibes-only vibe!


Pursues Excellence


We're not just about doing our jobs; we're on a mission to master our craft. With a growth mindset and a desire to learn and grow, we're relentless in our pursuit of excellence. Mediocrity? Nah, not our style. We're all about raising the bar and becoming the absolute best in our field. Smashing goals? It's our fuel. And we do it all together, thriving on shared success.


I can figure it out/Google it attitude


Hey, nobody's got all the answers, right? That's why our team rocks - because they're all about that thirst for knowledge and the know-how to quench it. Thanks to the vast wonders of the internet, there's practically nothing we can't figure out. Stumped on something? No sweat, just dive into the Google pool!


Innovative


We're all about agility, evolution, and innovation. Flexibility is our middle name—we're constantly refining, experimenting, and pushing boundaries. New ideas? Bring 'em on! Creativity is our secret sauce, and thinking outside the box is just how we roll. Forget about the status quo; we're all about embracing change. We're not attached to an old way of doing things - We're attached to winning.


Student Mentality


We dedicate ourselves to uplifting each other and pushing Search Atlas onwards and upwards (to the moon!). Mistakes and rough days happen to everyone, but we approach them with understanding and trust in each other's good intentions. Our team remains grounded and committed, persistently striving to improve. Mistakes are opportunities for growth; we embrace them, learn from them, and continually evolve as a result.

The Verticals team encompasses 3 critical and unique products / marketplaces within Lyft: airports, scheduled rides, and events. Airports are one of the most important, impactful, and complex parts of Lyft’s Rideshare business, as they are a key part of both the rider and driver Lyft experience and have unique dynamics. Scheduled rides allow riders to book a ride in advance with high reliability, and enable drivers to add structure to their work schedule. Lastly, events such as concerts or sporting games require similar considerations of special operations to ensure a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.

How are riders and drivers using different ride modes at airports and events, and how do we design products to address this behavior?
How are riders and drivers discovering scheduled rides and are there entry point optimizations we can implement?


Responsibilities:


Leverage data and analytic frameworks to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency across Verticals products, recommending solutions to drive business impact
Understand the complex business dynamics across the Verticals product areas, specifically how these products differ from traditional rideshare marketplaces, to propose enhancements that compliment Lyft-wide products
Partner with product managers, engineers, marketers, designers, and operators to translate data insights into decisions and action
Develop dashboards and analytical frameworks to monitor business and product performance
Establish metrics that measure the health of our products, the business, as well as the rider and driver experiences


Experience:


5-7+ years of experience in data analytics in a high-growth environment
Degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, economics, applied math, operations research or engineering (an asset, advanced degrees also an asset)
End-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, analysis, and visualization
Ability to manage, influence, negotiate, and inspire others in a fast-moving environment
Proficient in SQL and quantitative analysis, you can deep dive into large amounts of data, draw meaningful insights, dissect business issues and draw actionable conclusions
Outcome-driven approach to developing recommendations and demonstrated ability to develop a story and execution plan to support goals and objectives
Exceptional communication (listening, written, and oral) skills with the ability to present findings and recommendations targeted to the audience in question.
A drive to understand the core issues along with the determination to uncover the solution
Thrives within ambiguity and context-switching
Strong oral and written communication skills, and ability to collaborate with cross-functional partners

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources
Define and monitor key economic impact metrics
Go deep on understanding business drivers, user segments, cohorts and macroeconomic trends
Prepare presentations, analyses and visualizations for internal and external executive audiences
Partner closely with Communications, Policy, Marketing and Product teams to identify and analyze key trends and produce thought leadership pieces and campaign content leveraging Stripe data
Collaborate with external vendors, academics, and think tanks to advance Stripe’s research agenda and advocacy positions



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Compensation Expectations For The Role

Jane’s committed to paying our team members fairly, clearly, and above all, paying for growth. This role has a minimum annual salary of $118,000 and maximum annual salary of $185,500. As you may have noticed, this salary range is quite large, and this is intentional to account for the growth someone will experience in the role throughout their time at Jane (i.e., from building the skills, to accomplished, to highly proficient, all the way to achieving excellence in the role). When hiring talented folks to join the Jane team, we’ve found that new team members are best set up for success when hired with the expectation of being accomplished in the role, which for this role would reflect a starting salary of $141,000.

It's also possible to join Jane at a salary above or below this, which would mean a salary below $141,000 typically reflects someone who has all the potential to be fully accomplished in the role but doesn't yet possess all the skills required, while a salary above $141,000 is typically for individuals who are currently in this role at Jane and had the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on our customers, product and company with deep Jane knowledge. At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.

Paying clearly is one of our compensation fundamentals to help folks build trust in the compensation process at Jane. To better understand Jane’s compensation fundamentals and how this range is determined, click on this link here for a short video walkthrough of how it all works!

Let’s kick things off with a quick intro. Jane is a team that’s all about fostering growth, spreading delight, and serving our healthcare community. We’re looking for people who are ready to jump in and join us as we simplify the lives of healthcare practitioners and patients every day.

At Jane, success means collaborating with your team, delivering an aligned result with efficiency and quality, communicating clearly and openly, and embracing continuous improvement. And guess what? Jane is a remote-first company, so every role, including this one, gives you the freedom to work from anywhere in Canada.

Your Role In Our Journey

Jane is looking for a Senior Data Analyst who will be responsible for delivering consistent, meaningful insights across the company with a focus on supporting our Marketing team. You will have strong experience with SQL, dbt, Looker and preferably experience in a fast growing software company. We're looking for someone who thrives in a fast-paced environment, enjoys working with stakeholders to solve business problems, and is excited about working with data that drives business impact. You’ll have the opportunity to shape how Jane uses data to improve product adoption, customer retention, and marketing efficiency. At Jane, we value transparency, ownership, and a problem-solving mindset. If you’re excited about working with data to unlock business insights and help shape decision-making, this could be the perfect role for you.

Learn More About Us

We're founder-led, which means we live our values while maintaining a clear vision for the future. Our product enables the likes of physiotherapists, mental health counsellors, chiropractors, and other allied health practitioners to run their practices in a digital-first way through features such as online booking, charting, scheduling, telehealth, secure payments and billing along with an evolving library of features. You can see more of them here .

We're a company that is growing rapidly, and with that comes the challenge of navigating an environment with many moving parts, often without a clear-cut path laid out in front of us. If you're the kind of person who gets a kick out of being resourceful and loves solving problems, we would love to hear from you.

No doubt, Jane's a special place to work. There is autonomy and flexibility to help integrate work into your life in a way that makes sense for you. Need to block out time to pick up the kids? Go for it. That's normal here. And yes, we have a Slack channel for parents, but we've also got channels dedicated to plants, furry friends, food, pride, wellness - you get the idea! While we love to connect virtually, the Jane team also connects in person throughout the year.

We believe in collaboration, humility, and keeping a growth mindset. We're looking for people who can embrace our way of working, which often means being flexible and open to change. So, if after reading this, you feel excited about the opportunity — all in the name of helping those who help others — reach out to us to learn more.

Compensation Expectations For The Role

Jane’s committed to paying our team members fairly, clearly, and above all, paying for growth. This role has a minimum annual salary of $97,600 and maximum annual salary of $152,400. As you may have noticed, this salary range is quite large, and this is intentional to account for the growth someone will experience in the role throughout their time at Jane (i.e., from building the skills, to accomplished, to highly proficient, all the way to achieving excellence in the role). When hiring talented folks to join the Jane team, we’ve found that new team members are best set up for success when hired with the expectation of being fully accomplished in the role, which for this role would reflect a starting salary of $115,900.

It's also possible to join Jane at a salary above or below this, which would mean a salary below $115,900 typically reflects someone who has all the potential to be fully accomplished in the role but doesn't yet possess all the skills required, while a salary above $115,900 is typically for individuals who are currently in this role at Jane and had the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on our customers, product and company with deep Jane knowledge. At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.

Paying clearly is one of our compensation fundamentals to help folks build trust in the compensation process at Jane. To better understand Jane’s compensation fundamentals and how this range is determined, click on this link here for a short video walkthrough of how it all works! We also welcome you to ask as many questions as you’d like about compensation throughout the interview process to ensure you feel confident and build trust through the process.

More information on our benefits can be found here !

At Jane, we’re committed to fostering an environment that allows you to come to work as your truest self. We believe it’s important to actively recognize, embrace, and celebrate our differences in order to make Jane an inclusive, equitable, and diverse workplace.

We want to build a team of people who make conversations rich with perspective and experience. We are committed to listening to every voice in order to learn and grow because doing this will allow us to meet the needs of the diverse community of helpers that Jane serves.

We do not tolerate discrimination, prejudice, or oppressive isms of any kind. Employment is decided on the basis of qualifications, merit, experience, and the needs of the Jane community. We encourage anyone who requires accommodation or adjustments throughout the interview process to let us know, and we will do our best to support you.

We are a rapidly growing organization with clients from Fortune 500 companies to leading Silicon Valley tech startups.

We’re scaling fast — and we need a Data Analyst who can dive deep, query like a boss, and help us make data-driven decisions in real time.

This is a remote, contract role (part-time or full-time) with immediate start. You’ll work alongside product, finance, and ops to build the backbone of our SaaS reporting engine.

Connect data sources (Stripe, CRM, app backend, etc.) to make real-time insights accessible to the team


Tools You Should Know


Must-Have: Stripe Sigma, PostgreSQL, Retool, Google Sheets/Excel
Nice-to-Have: Metabase, Looker Studio, BigQuery, Chartio, Snowflake, Python
Bonus: Experience building dashboards directly in Stripe, using Sigma + external tools


What We’re Looking For


Strong experience querying large datasets with SQL
Solid understanding of SaaS metrics and growth levers
Ability to go from raw data to insights & visuals quickly
Comfortable working async in a fast-paced remote environment


Salary : $20–$25/hr depending on experience

Benefits: 11 Days PTO + Christmas Day + New Years Day paid off

Life at Search Atlas Group

At Search Atlas Group, we are committed to enjoying life as we are to delivering best-in-class services and software. From community volunteer days, socially conscious initiatives, and team lunches and outings, our office reflects our team’s diverse interests.

We’re a growing team of diverse professionals, however, we all share the same goals: to be a part of a company that’s on the edge of digital marketing, to make the world a better place, and to have fun doing it. Our team culture is one of fast-paced innovation, where each person is empowered to take on their own ambitious projects, with the support of their teammates. We’ve got plenty of perks, but the biggest one is working with other energetic high-achievers.

We Are Very Proud Of The Kind, Inclusive, And Collaborative Company Culture We Have Built And Have Been Very Lucky To Be Recognized By Both National And Local Industry Leaders

Here's a Look Into Our Core Values


Collaborative and Highly Engaged


Work is where we invest a big chunk of our lives. And hey, we're all about making that time awesome! Picture this: we're not just coworkers; we're like a squad that's always got each other's backs. We're all about cheering each other on, sharing what we know, and picking each other up when things get messy. Plus, we're big on being real with each other, so there's no room for office drama or gossip. We're all about that good vibes-only vibe!


Pursues Excellence


We're not just about doing our jobs; we're on a mission to master our craft. With a growth mindset and a desire to learn and grow, we're relentless in our pursuit of excellence. Mediocrity? Nah, not our style. We're all about raising the bar and becoming the absolute best in our field. Smashing goals? It's our fuel. And we do it all together, thriving on shared success.


I can figure it out/Google it attitude


Hey, nobody's got all the answers, right? That's why our team rocks - because they're all about that thirst for knowledge and the know-how to quench it. Thanks to the vast wonders of the internet, there's practically nothing we can't figure out. Stumped on something? No sweat, just dive into the Google pool!


Innovative


We're all about agility, evolution, and innovation. Flexibility is our middle name—we're constantly refining, experimenting, and pushing boundaries. New ideas? Bring 'em on! Creativity is our secret sauce, and thinking outside the box is just how we roll. Forget about the status quo; we're all about embracing change. We're not attached to an old way of doing things - We're attached to winning.


Student Mentality


We dedicate ourselves to uplifting each other and pushing Search Atlas onwards and upwards (to the moon!). Mistakes and rough days happen to everyone, but we approach them with understanding and trust in each other's good intentions. Our team remains grounded and committed, persistently striving to improve. Mistakes are opportunities for growth; we embrace them, learn from them, and continually evolve as a result.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Tools You Should Know


Must-Have: Stripe Sigma, PostgreSQL, Retool, Google Sheets/Excel
Nice-to-Have: Metabase, Looker Studio, BigQuery, Chartio, Snowflake, Python
Bonus: Experience building dashboards directly in Stripe, using Sigma + external tools


What We’re Looking For


Strong experience querying large datasets with SQL
Solid understanding of SaaS metrics and growth levers
Ability to go from raw data to insights & visuals quickly
Comfortable working async in a fast-paced remote environment


Salary : $20–$25/hr depending on experience

We’re a growing team of diverse professionals, however, we all share the same goals: to be a part of a company that’s on the edge of digital marketing, to make the world a better place, and to have fun doing it. Our team culture is one of fast-paced innovation, where each person is empowered to take on their own ambitious projects, with the support of their teammates. We’ve got plenty of perks, but the biggest one is working with other energetic high-achievers.

Here's a Look Into Our Core Values


Collaborative and Highly Engaged


Work is where we invest a big chunk of our lives. And hey, we're all about making that time awesome! Picture this: we're not just coworkers; we're like a squad that's always got each other's backs. We're all about cheering each other on, sharing what we know, and picking each other up when things get messy. Plus, we're big on being real with each other, so there's no room for office drama or gossip. We're all about that good vibes-only vibe!


Pursues Excellence


We're not just about doing our jobs; we're on a mission to master our craft. With a growth mindset and a desire to learn and grow, we're relentless in our pursuit of excellence. Mediocrity? Nah, not our style. We're all about raising the bar and becoming the absolute best in our field. Smashing goals? It's our fuel. And we do it all together, thriving on shared success.


I can figure it out/Google it attitude


Hey, nobody's got all the answers, right? That's why our team rocks - because they're all about that thirst for knowledge and the know-how to quench it. Thanks to the vast wonders of the internet, there's practically nothing we can't figure out. Stumped on something? No sweat, just dive into the Google pool!


Innovative


We're all about agility, evolution, and innovation. Flexibility is our middle name—we're constantly refining, experimenting, and pushing boundaries. New ideas? Bring 'em on! Creativity is our secret sauce, and thinking outside the box is just how we roll. Forget about the status quo; we're all about embracing change. We're not attached to an old way of doing things - We're attached to winning.


Student Mentality


We dedicate ourselves to uplifting each other and pushing Search Atlas onwards and upwards (to the moon!). Mistakes and rough days happen to everyone, but we approach them with understanding and trust in each other's good intentions. Our team remains grounded and committed, persistently striving to improve. Mistakes are opportunities for growth; we embrace them, learn from them, and continually evolve as a result.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources
Define and monitor key economic impact metrics
Go deep on understanding business drivers, user segments, cohorts and macroeconomic trends
Prepare presentations, analyses and visualizations for internal and external executive audiences
Partner closely with Communications, Policy, Marketing and Product teams to identify and analyze key trends and produce thought leadership pieces and campaign content leveraging Stripe data
Collaborate with external vendors, academics, and think tanks to advance Stripe’s research agenda and advocacy positions



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

2+ years data modelling, analysis, cleaning and QA

Title Data Analyst Job Status Regular Full Time Position Overview

The City of North Vancouver is the urban core of the beautiful North Shore and has a long-term vision to be “The Healthiest Small City in the World”, with five key priorities to be a City for People, a Resilient City, a Vibrant City, a Connected City and a Prosperous City.

The Information Technology department requires a highly driven and innovative Data Analyst to support data initiatives that enhance decision-making and operational effectiveness across municipal services.
