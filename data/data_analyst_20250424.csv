DATA ANALYST - FINANCIAL & PAYMENTS CONTROLLER

Antonio, our Head of Payments, is looking for a Data Analyst to support financial and payment operations related to Scalapay IP, our licensed payment institute.

This is not your typical analyst role: you’ll have the opportunity to take full ownership of projects end-to-end, working across the entire payments and financial data lifecycle from analysis to execution. You’ll operate at the intersection of people, processes, and data, playing a critical role in ensuring operational accuracy, payment integrity, SLA compliance, and risk mitigation in a regulated environment.

If you're passionate about payments and want to build deep expertise while working with cutting-edge technologies in a modern, fast-paced setting, this role is your springboard.

What You’ll Do:


Reconciliation oversight: Ensure timely and accurate reconciliations across multiple workflows, maintaining data integrity and collaborating closely with the finance team.
SLA monitoring of third-party providers: Track and validate the performance of external providers (e.g., processors, acquirers, banking partners) against contractual SLAs. Ensure service levels are met, escalate deviations, and contribute to reporting for internal stakeholders and audits.
Stakeholder collaboration: Work cross-functionally with internal teams and external partners (banks, acquirers, processors) to address inquiries, optimize processes, and identify improvement opportunities.
Continuous process improvement: Collect and refine business and technical requirements to improve accuracy and streamline operations.
Risk control and issue resolution: Proactively identify, assess, and mitigate operational risks. Conduct checks on bank and acquirer integrations, manage incidents, and troubleshoot processing errors using internal tools.
Invoice reconciliation: Validate invoices from acquirers, processors, and card schemes, ensuring accuracy in charges and proper revenue attribution.


What we are looking for:


Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Finance, Economics, or Technology;
3 - 6 years of experience in banking, fintech, or financial services - preferably within payments, operations, or reconciliation;
Advanced proficiency in SQL and Excel, with a strong data-driven mindset;
Working knowledge of scripting languages such as Python or R to automate tasks and improve data workflows;
Experience with Business Intelligence tools (e.g., Looker, Power BI, Tableau);
Fluency in Italian and English, both written and spoken.


Why you should join Scalapay:


Competitive compensation tailored to your experience and skills
International environment with exciting challenges every day
Work with industry experts and tech leaders building world-class fintech products
Career acceleration with tailored mentorship and ownership of your work
Access to cutting-edge tools and technologies, your creativity is welcome
A culture that values innovation, transparency, and continuous feedback


Recruitment Process:


A quick chat with one of our Talent Acquisition team members
The first interview with Antonio (Head of Payments) to deep dive into your experiences and better understand your motivation
A case study to test your hard skills
The review of the test study with Antonio and Johnny (our CTO)
A final chat with Simone (our CEO) where he will share and assess the Scalapay Values

Pro tip: send your CV in English 😉

Super Pro tip: we know that application processes can be scary and frustrating but… we look for talent, not people that tick all our boxes.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.




To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.




For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.




A few examples of your responsibilities

Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.




What we look for

Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.




What we offer

Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of €52,246. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.




Commitment & contract

Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time.




Location

Milan (Italy) or fully remote.




Before you apply

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We’re extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don’t hesitate to apply.




The selection process

We welcome applications in English and Italian. If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.




Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested through this form.




Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

We want to innovate the financial services offered by commercial/retail banks in Italy in the areas of wealth management, credit lending, risk management and compliance. Building on our consolidated expertise and product offering in the Capital Markets domain, we want to scale our solutions and frameworks to the commercial/retail banking industry. To do so, we start from the quantitative modelling and analysis of the current processes put in place by our customers, so that we can profile opportunities of automation and prioritize client needs on manual/painful workflows. The resource will be involved in business process analyses of Italian commercial/retail financial institutions and is expected to integrate structured information extracted from interviews with the analysis of literature and documentation to build a quantitative picture of the AS-IS. The analysis will then be complemented with a consequent implementation analysis and product roadmap definition to design the TO-BE and drive product evolutions and developments. The project entails modelling complex business contexts, extracting structured information from unstructured sources, performing quantitative analyses, presenting findings and recommendations to external clients and internal stakeholders, contributing to the definition of product backlogs.

What You Will Learn During Your Intern

Geo Solutions is een Belgisch bedrijf dat organisaties helpt om de kracht van locatiedata ten volle te benutten. Wij ontwerpen en ontwikkelen slimme GEO-ICT oplossingen op maat. Onze innovatieve en flexibele dienstverlening ondersteunt klanten in de overheid, nutsbedrijven, industrie en constructie bij strategische en operationele beslissingen.




Waar je ons terugvindt? Wel, ons hoofdkantoor is gelegen in Edegem, maar we bieden ook flexplekken aan in onze hubs in Gent, Leuven en Namen. Daarnaast zal je ook op wekelijkse basis ter plaatse op je toegewezen project bij je klant werken.




Zo ziet jouw rol als Data Analist eruit:

Werkplek: bij je klant, Geo-kantoor/hub, thuis




Als Data Analist bij Geo Solutions maak je locatiedata inzichtelijk voor onze klanten. Een achtergrond in de brede wereld van geo is niet noodzakelijk, maar je hart mag wel een slagje sneller slaan bij het zien van X, Y en Z’s.




Een greep uit je takenpakket:

Je vertaalt businessnoden naar datavereisten, en je kan daar helder over communiceren.
Je voert diepgaande en kwalitatieve analyses uit op complexe datasets en zet de bevindingen om naar heldere rapporten.
Je schat het potentieel van use cases in door een eerste exploratieve screening. Daarbij zet je zowel een sceptische als opportunistische bril op.
Je volgt technologische ontwikkelingen op en deelt actief je kennis met interne en externe collega’s.




Jouw profiel:

Bachelor- of masterdiploma in IT of een wetenschappelijke richting
Minstens 5 jaar ervaring als data analist of een vergelijkbare rol
Sterk in Python met ervaring in (Geo)Pandas, NumPy, Folium, DuckDB, Polars, …
Ervaren in SQL en ETL-processen
Vaardig met BI- tools (Power BI, Tableau, Qlik, Superset) bij voorkeur met geografische data
Ervaring met big data (Hadoop, Spark, Databricks) en cloudplatformen (Azure, GCP, AWS)
Kennis van AI/ML (TensorFlow, Torch, Keras) is een plus
Vloeiend Nederlands en Engels zijn een evidentie




Dit krijg je van ons

In ruil voor je inzet en leergierigheid bieden we je een boeiende job met toffe collega’s. En dat in een bedrijfscultuur die persoonlijke ontwikkeling en vernieuwing sterk aanmoedigt.




Bij Geo Solutions mag je rekenen op:

Een aantrekkelijk salarispakket: een brutoloon (rekening houden met je ervaring en diploma), aangevuld met bedrijfswagen en tankkaart (of laadkaart), maaltijdcheques, hospitalisatie- en groepsverzekering, maandelijkse onkostenvergoeding.
Een gezonde werk-life balans: zo willen wij plezier binnen en buiten de werkuren motivering door flexibele werktijden aan te bieden
Aandacht voor nieuwe ideeën: hier ben je geen nummer, wel een belangrijke aanwinst voor het team. We horen graag hoe jij bepaalde projecten ziet en hoe jij het zou aanpakken
Doorgroeimogelijkheden: we juichen met veel plezier je leergierigheid toe en bieden je toegang tot onze Geo Academy. Wil je graag een extra training volgen, een certificaat behalen of een externe opleiding volgen, dat kan allemaal!
State of the art technologieën: je bouwt ze niet alleen, je werkt er ook mee!




Kan je niet wachten om ons team te versterken? Stuur je cv en een korte motivatie naar jobs@geosolutions.be




Diversiteit, inclusie en gelijkheid

Bij ons draait het om mensen. We willen een plek zijn waar je jezelf kunt zijn, ongeacht wie je bent of hoe je in het leven staat.

En tant que data analyst, vous êtes responsable de la conversion de grandes quantités de données en informations analytiques qui aident la direction et les différentes lignes métier à prendre des décisions stratégiques.

Vous utilisez des outils analytiques et développez des modèles statistiques pour :


analyser et mesurer les performances des campagnes commerciales, pour lesquelles vous développez des scores statistiques et prédictifs (scores de réponse, scores d'uplift...) afin d'optimiser la personnalisation, le taux de réponse et la rentabilité des communications;
analyser la performance et accompagner les équipes métier dans la mise en place d'outils analytiques pour mesurer et améliorer l'efficacité opérationnelle (analyses de prix, segmentation clients...);
développer des tableaux de bord et proposer des indicateurs clés, qui permettent à la direction de prendre des décisions stratégiques;
participer à des études statistiques et utiliser les données à disposition afin de répondre à des problématiques métier;
Vous travaillez également en collaboration avec les équipes marketing et êtes responsable de la mise en place de plans de test et des envois des communications vers nos clients finaux.



En résumé, vous transformez les données d'AlphaCrédit en informations à destination de nos collègues des différents départements, afin de les accompagner dans leurs prises de décisions. La communication est donc également une part importante du poste car vous serez en contact avec différents interlocuteurs et devez d'une part échanger afin de bien comprendre les besoins et d'autre part restituer vos travaux et vos conclusions.

L'environnement de travail, c'est important !

Le département Data d’AlphaCredit se compose de quatre services : Predictive & performance analytics, Data preparation & visualization, Data governance et Data hub.

L’équipe predictive & performance analytics, ce sont six collaborateurs qui, grâce à des opérations innovantes de gestion des données et d'analyses statistiques, contribuent à la rentabilité des différents portefeuilles d’activités, à la rentabilité des actions marketing et à l’optimisation des processus opérationnels d'AlphaCredit.

Les locaux sont situés dans le centre de Bruxelles, à deux pas de la Gare Centrale.

Et après ?

Cette expérience au sein de l'équipe analytique de Alpha Crédit vous permettra de mettre en pratique et d'appliquer vos connaissances en programmation et en statistiques sur une grande quantité de données, à la fois internes et externes, et d'apporter votre contribution dans la chaîne de création de valeur.

La diversité des sujets (gestion des campagnes marketing, segmentation clients...) et des interlocuteurs (départements marketing, opération, auto...) développera votre capacité d'analyse et de compréhension des enjeux, ainsi que votre relationnel et vos capacités de communication.

At Euroclear, we are the financial industry's leading provider of post-trade services, headquartered in Brussels with offices in over 15 countries worldwide. We facilitate the settlement, custody, and servicing of national and cross-border securities transactions—including bonds, shares, derivatives, and investment funds.

Ready to embark on this journey? Join us and shape the future of finance with Euroclear!




Division




As an IT Newbie, you will join the Group Business Solutions (GBS) division, where you will undergo an intensive 3-month training program. Throughout this journey, you will be closely guided by a mentor and supported by a buddy - someone with hands-on experience in a similar role ensuring a smooth transition into your new career.




The GBS division ensures the competitiveness of Euroclear by delivering reliable and sustainable IT solutions for the financial securities markets.

Scalability: Mainframes can handle heavy workloads, including large amounts of data processing and storage, making them ideal for financial transactions that require large computing resources.
Compliance: Financial institutions are subject to strict regulations and standards, and mainframes are equipped with features that help ensure compliance with these regulations.
Performance: Mainframes are optimized for high performance and can process a large number of transactions quickly, which is essential for financial organizations that handle large amounts of data.

Warum eigentlich wir?

Weil wir Schweizer KMUs helfen, mehr aus ihren Daten rauszuholen – und das richtig gut.

Mit tiefem Unternehmensverständnis, klar strukturierten Power BI-Dashboards und solidem Data Engineering machen wir aus Zahlen echte Aha-Momente.

Über 50 KMUs vertrauen schon auf uns – und es werden laufend mehr.

Deshalb brauchen wir dich!




Deine Rolle bei uns

Du wirst zum echten Sparringspartner für unsere Kunden – direkt im Gespräch mit den Entscheidern.

Dein Alltag ist abwechslungsreich, hands-on und datengetrieben:

Du analysierst Kundenbedürfnisse und bringst Struktur ins Datendickicht
Du designst und entwickelst Power BI-Dashboards & Reports – und testest sie gemeinsam mit den Kunden
Du arbeitest parallel an mehreren Projekten (10+ pro Jahr – langweilig wird dir sicher nie)
Bei kleineren Projekten übernimmst du direkt die Projektleitung




Was du mitbringen solltest

Mind. 2 Jahre Erfahrung im Daten- oder BI-Consulting (Power BI und Fabric sind ein Plus)
Deutsch auf Muttersprachniveau, Englisch verhandlungssicher
Du arbeitest eigenständig, denkst mit und hast Lust, dazuzulernen
Du kennst den Spagat zwischen mehreren Projekten und bleibst dabei cool
Grundlegendes BWL-Verständnis – oder zumindest Lust darauf

Nice to have:

Erfahrung mit Azure, SQL oder Python
Kenntnisse von ERP-Systemen (z. B. Abacus, Dynamics, SAP, Odoo, etc.)
Französisch? Nice ... äh sympa!




Was du von uns bekommst

Ein faires Gehalt – ganz ohne Bullshit
Flexible Arbeitszeiten
Modernes Büro mit allem Drum und Dran
Anspruchsvolle Projekte & direkter Kundenkontakt
Viel Verantwortung, viel Freiheit, viel Raum zum Wachsen




...but wait, there's more!

Du bist mehr als nur „Consultant“ auf dem Papier?

Dann haben wir Spielraum für deine Talente – z. B.:

bei der Organisation von Community-Events
beim Verfassen von Blog-Artikeln für unsere Web-Seite (dein Personal Brand freut sich!)
bei deiner fachlichen Weiterentwicklung im Selbststudium & für Zertifizierungen




Unser Bewerbungsprozess (aka ""The Happy Flow""):

Dein Profil passt? Dann melden wir uns innerhalb von 5 Arbeitstagen für ein erstes Online-Gespräch mit einem der Gründer.
Wenn’s für beide Seiten gut aussieht, folgt ein lockeres Kennenlernen mit einem weiteren Teammitglied.
Immer noch ein Match? Dann geht's ans Eingemachte bei einer kurzen Fallstudie (2h, online oder bei uns – ohne Vorbereitung).
Jetzt wird’s konkret: Wir besprechen Rolle, Gehalt & Ziele.
Handshake? Let’s go – du startest bei Power Partners durch!




Klingt spannend? Dann bewirb dich – wir freuen uns auf dich!

We create user value

We strive to always create valuable experiences for our users in everything we do. Our focus is to always innovate new experiences that are safe, pleasant and efficient.

We are data-driven

We are strong believers in making informed decisions, that’s why we are data-driven. We can better navigate the business landscape strategically by analyzing valuable metrics.

Win-win Collaboration

Success is a team sport. When we work to help our partners and colleagues win, we win, too. While keeping everyone's best interest at heart, we communicate with candor and execute with excellence in all we do.

Integrity is at the very core of our business. We are people who always want to do the right thing. Our intentions are sincere, we speak our minds and listen to each other.
