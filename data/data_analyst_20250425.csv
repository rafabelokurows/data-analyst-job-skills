The Revenue Analytics team provides the company with insights into what drives our past and current revenue and membership trends as well as an outlook on future growth. Internally, our analytical insights help inform our growth and monetization strategy. Our revenue and membership forecasts are critical components that feed into the corporate planning process for spending and resource allocation across content, commerce, and technology.

Netflix is looking for the best and brightest candidates to use data and business insights to inform and drive key strategic decisions. We believe that we derive a significant competitive advantage from the highly analytical approach we take to managing the company. Senior management relies heavily on the Revenue Analytics team to develop a data-driven perspective on the company's growth, and the outcomes of our analyses play a critical role in how we plan for and execute on the company's business objectives.

This role is based out of Netflix’s EMEA headquarters in Amsterdam. The role will include occasional travel to Netflix’s global headquarters in California.

Support efforts to centralize and standardize revenue performance reporting, helping identify cross-region best practices to enhance scalability and consistency in business analytics


Qualifications

A successful candidate should have the ability to combine comprehensive data analytics with sound business intuition and judgment, and effectively communicate analytical insights to stakeholders. Given the questions asked of our team are often urgent in nature and have an immediate impact on how the business makes decisions, the individual coming into this role must be able to deliver accurate results promptly. They must thrive in a fast-paced environment, possess a high level of intellectual curiosity, focus on generating results, and exhibit the highest personal and professional standards of integrity and ethics.

Possess a high level of intellectual curiosity, discipline, and flexibility
Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Highly skilled in preparing effective presentations (Google Slides, MS PowerPoint) with a clear narrative and impactful visuals

3 reasons why this is (not) for you Switch to find out


- If you strongly value clarity No, if innovating, autonomy, and ambiguity sound terrifying to you.
- You only want to process data No, if you only want to process data and prefer someone else to handle project and stakeholder management.
- If you believe analysts don’t need domain knowledge No, if you don't want to dive into the world of advertising. Curiosity and willingness to learn about our domain and customers are key to your success.
+ You’re an analytics professional Yes, if you have 5+ year experience delighting decision makers with your analytical skills. SQL is a must, Python scripting is a strong plus.
+ Obsess over creating value for advertisers Yes, if you believe output does not equal outcome and judge success by value creation.
+ You get (and create) energy by working with others Yes, if you can translate technical information into language anyone can understand. You enjoy working with both data and people.


It is our responsibility to enable an environment that unleashes the power of diversity.

In jouw rol ben je verantwoordelijk voor het integreren van klantdata met andere databronnen en het omzetten van deze gegevens in actionable insights. Je ontwikkelt en optimaliseert zowel nieuwe als bestaande dashboards die onze opdrachtgevers ondersteunen. Hierbij identificeer je nieuwe databronnen, valideer je de verzamelde data en presenteer je deze op een overzichtelijke manier.

Een persoonlijk opleidingsbudget
Laptop, vaste onkostenvergoeding en telefoonvergoeding
Direct een vast dienstverband

Verbinding is één van onze kernwaarden, we investeren dus gedurende het hele jaar in inhoudelijke, inspirerende en vooral leuke events
Een hybride werk cultuur. We vinden elkaar zeker op ons gezellige kantoor in Amsterdam (vlakbij station Bijlmer Arena), maar stimuleren eigen verantwoordelijkheid en flexibiliteit

HBO/WO gediplomeerd

Over Novisource

Novisource is een kleinschalige, ambitieuze en persoonlijke consultancy-organisatie. We bemiddelen intelligente, gedreven en gepassioneerde consultants die meebouwen aan de (digitale) verandering van morgen. Vooralsnog met name in de financiële sector, maar we werken hard aan uitbreiding van onze klantenportefeuille.

The commodity world is complex—it is fast-moving but traditional. These everyday products, from your morning coffee to the grains in your pasta, play a critical role in the global economy and in our daily lives.




Vesper is disrupting the commodity game. We are the fastest-growing commodity intelligence platform, trusted by giants like Nestlé, Unilever, and Danone. We combine cutting-edge AI with real-world data to give our customers the insights they need to win in a volatile market.




What we expect from this role




As our Business Intelligence Analyst, your mission is to derive actionable insights and opportunities from our internal data. There is an emphasis on product and usage behavior, but also financial and commercial data play an important role. You will help us build a smarter, faster business by providing data-informed answers to key questions like “How can we improve our retention?” or “What is our churn risk from certain customer segments?”.




You will partner closely with other teams and play an important role by building automated data pipelines, creating actionable insights while also enabling self-serve analytics to support our strategic and business decision-making.




We are looking for somebody who loves getting “into the data”, improving data-driven decision-making processes, translating business questions into BI solutions, applying analytics rigour to strategic questions and collaborating effectively with others.




If you like to jump on a high-speed train, enjoy all the learnings that come from a rapidly changing environment, get energy from having autonomy and enjoy an environment where decisions are made in a minute, this role might be for you!




What you will be doing




Generate accurate and reliable data insights: break down business problems and turn raw data into actionable insights around user behavior (e.g. customer retention, cost-usage analysis)
Enable data-informed decision making: empower all departments and management to make data-driven decisions by providing relevant automated dashboards, tailor-made insights or self-serve analytics where needed
Build and maintain data infrastructure: develop and optimize ETL pipelines to consolidate data from various raw data sources and integrate them into a unified database
Secure data reliability: ensure data is consistent, accurate and trustworthy – from collection to reporting

What you will bring




2-4 years experience in a role in Business Intelligence, Analytics, or a related field – ideally with previous experience in a fast-paced environment (scale-up, tech or product-driven organisation)
Strong analytical and problem solving skills – you break down complex problems using data and can translate ambiguous business questions into measurable insights
Solid technical foundation — you have proven skills in SQL and Python and are comfortable with data modeling, setting up and managing ETL processes, and database design (ideally with previous experience with Airflow)
Solid stakeholder management skills – you love to say “yes”, but definitely know when to say “no”. You keep everyone in the loop and can create a shared understanding across the team
Excellent communication skills — you speak both “data” and “human” and can work with technical peers and non-technical stakeholders
Business intuition — you understand how different parts of the business connect and how to prioritize what matters most
Autonomy & initiative – you don’t wait to be told what to do. You seek out problems, validate assumptions and propose solutions
An eye for detail — you take pride in clean, accurate data and high-quality wor
Bachelor or Master degree in a relevant field (e.g., Computer Science, Engineering, Data Science, Business Analytics)




What you get




A fast-moving, high-growth environment with plenty of opportunity to learn
Full ownership of your domain, and the trust to shape your role
A collaborative culture that values speed, clarity, and impact
A chance to transform a traditional business impacting every day of our lives
A fantastic location in the city centre of Amsterdam
Great hangouts with brilliant people

Onze uitdaging

Onze uitdaging is om inzicht te krijgen in €9.500+ miljard aan Europees institutioneel belegd vermogen. We willen weten in welke beleggingscategorieën dit vermogen is belegd en welke investment managers hierbij betrokken zijn. Dit doen we door openbare data over de Europese institutionele markt te verzamelen en te analyseren. Met zelf ontwikkelde software zetten we deze data om in analyses. Dagelijks scrapen wij duizenden websites en documenten om de nodige informatie te verzamelen.




Vervolgens analyseren we de beleggingsportefeuilles van institutionele beleggers zoals pensioenfondsen en verzekeraars. We onderzoeken in welke categorieën zij beleggen, hoeveel zij investeren, en welke investment managers deze assets beheren. Deze data is via het Exelerating platform beschikbaar voor onze gebruikers. Onze gebruikers, waaronder de grootste investment managers en consultants in Europa, gebruiken dagelijks het Exelerating platform om op de hoogte te blijven van ontwikkelingen in de institutionele markt.




Functieomschrijving

Als Intern Data Analyst ben je nauw betrokken bij het volledige dataproces, van begin tot eind. De nadruk van je werkzaamheden ligt op het verzamelen en verwerken van zowel kwalitatieve als kwantitatieve data. Daarnaast ondersteun je onze gebruikers bij het maken van analyses over de institutionele markt. Gebruikers willen bijvoorbeeld weten wie er in een bepaalde beleggingscategorie investeert, hoeveel er belegd is, en wat de beleggingsresultaten zijn geweest. Tijdens je werkzaamheden verwachten wij dat je kritisch naar ons platform kijkt en voorstellen doet om dit te optimaliseren.




Wat bieden wij nog meer?

Op ons expertisegebied zijn wij marktleider in Nederland. Wij werken samen met meer dan zestig van de grootste investment managers en consultants actief in de Europese institutionele sector. Onze klanten zitten niet alleen in Nederland, maar ook in het Verenigd Koninkrijk, Duitsland, Scandinavië en Zwitserland. Wij bieden jou een unieke mogelijkheid om de institutionele wereld te leren kennen en begrijpen. Je leert alle ins en outs van de Europese institutionele markt (€ 9.500+ miljard). Wij leren je alles wat je moet weten over hoe Europese institutionele beleggers investeren en hoe zij onderling verbonden zijn. Aan het einde van je stage weet je precies wat investment managers en institutionele beleggers zijn en hoe zij opereren.

Ben jij enthousiast over deze functie en wil je deel uitmaken van ons team? We zien je motivatiebrief en cv graag tegemoet via info@exelerating.com. Na ontvangst van je sollicitatie nodigen we je uit voor een kennismakingsgesprek bij ons op kantoor aan de Herengracht 162 in Amsterdam.

Dit bedrijf is sinds 2010 actief in de wereld van webscraping en is marktleider in het verzamelen en analyseren van prijs-, promotie- en positioneringsdata. Dagelijks halen zij gegevens op van meer dan 300 retailers, waaronder grote supermarktketens zoals Albert Heijn en Jumbo, maar ook bekende e-commerceplatforms. De verzamelde data wordt verwerkt tot uitgebreide rapportages en gebruiksvriendelijke online tools. Duizenden klanten maken hier dagelijks gebruik van om hun prijsstrategieën te optimaliseren en concurrentievoordeel te behalen. Grote supermarktketens baseren hun prijzen op deze inzichten. Het bedrijf groeit snel en breidt internationaal uit. Om meerdere landen en diensten te integreren, is een schaalbare en flexibele aanpak nodig. Dit betekent dat de tooling continu doorontwikkeld wordt om grote hoeveelheden data efficiënt te kunnen verwerken en analyseren. Wil jij bijdragen aan de ontwikkeling van deze geavanceerde tools en werken met grote hoeveelheden data in een technische omgeving? Lees dan verder.




Wat ga je doen?

Controleren en matchen van productdata op basis van AI-voorsortering
Signaleren van fouten, afwijkingen en terugkerende patronen in grote datasets
Verbeteringen voorstellen en doorvoeren in de dataprocessen
Overleggen met het developmentteam over tooling, dashboards en procesoptimalisatie
Na verloop van tijd: coördineren van werk, junior collega’s aansturen, kwaliteit bewaken
Jij zorgt ervoor dat onze AI klopt. Wat jij vandaag corrigeert, bepaalt morgen de prijs van een pak melk bij duizenden retailers.




Functie eisen

Voor deze rol zoeken we iemand die nauwkeurig en scherp is, graag patronen herkent, en houdt van gestructureerd werken in een technische omgeving. Je hoeft geen hardcore programmeur of data scientist te zijn – als jij procesmatig denkt en analytisch sterk bent, ben je al een eind op weg.

HBO werk- en denkniveau (bijvoorbeeld richting data, IT, business, economie of bèta)
Affiniteit met data, IT en procesmatige werkzaamheden
Ervaring met Excel of SQL is een pre – nieuwsgierigheid is belangrijker
Je werkt zorgvuldig, denkt logisch en signaleert waar dingen beter kunnen
Je neemt initiatief, denkt mee en voelt je verantwoordelijk voor kwaliteit
Je hebt ambitie om te groeien in verantwoordelijkheid – richting teamlead of specialist




Arbeidsvoorwaarden

Je komt terecht in een informeel, groeiend bedrijf waar je echt impact kunt maken met je werk. Geen logge hiërarchie, maar korte lijnen, veel autonomie en ruimte om door te groeien.
Een salaris tot €3.000 bruto per maand, afhankelijk van ervaring en doorgroeipad
Hybride werken, met minimaal drie dagen per week op kantoor
Een NS Business Card of reiskostenvergoeding, kantoor is goed bereikbaar met OV
Een laptop van de zaak en alles wat je nodig hebt om goed te werken
Dagelijks lunch op kantoor, en regelmatig gezellige borrels of teamuitjes (denk: Formule 1, Disneyland, voetbal in Dublin)
Doorgroeimogelijkheden richting teamlead of andere interne rollen
Werken met data en tooling die gebruikt worden door bekende A-merken binnen retail en FMCG

Als BI Consultant bij Solviteers krijg je de kans om zowel expertise op te bouwen in Business Intelligence als kennis op te doen van de bronapplicaties binnen de overheidssector. Dit biedt een unieke combinatie die snel veel kennis en ervaring oplevert en een sterke positie in de markt mogelijk maakt. De aanwezigheid van ervaren collega’s stimuleert jouw ontwikkeling, net als de complexiteit en uitdagingen tijdens opdrachten. Dagelijks sta je voor complexe puzzels en geniet je van de variatie en uitdaging die de opdrachten bieden, waardoor je voortdurend wordt uitgedaagd en gemotiveerd.




Als BI Consultant analyseer je in eerste instantie de informatiebehoefte van de klant en ontwikkel je rapporten en dashboards. Je kunt je specialiseren in het maken van managementinformatie voor diverse bronapplicaties of nieuwe technieken toepassen. Verder kun je je verdiepen in datawarehousing als BI data engineer, een BI-architectuur ontwikkelen als data architect of voorspellingsmodellen maken als data scientist. Ten slotte kun je een adviserende rol aannemen om klanten te helpen bij het bepalen van hun managementinformatiebehoeften.




""Iedere dag krijg je te maken met complexe puzzels en veel afwisseling wat voldoende uitdaging biedt.""




Wat je gaat doen

Er zijn vijf hoofdrollen binnen BI, hoewel titels kunnen variëren. Vaak overlappen deze rollen, wat betekent dat je tijdens een opdracht elementen van meerdere rollen kunt tegenkomen.




In de basis vraag je bij de klant de behoefte naar managementinformatie uit en vertaal je deze naar een rapport of dashboard. Als BI Consultant richt je je op het ontwikkelen van het rapport of dashboard met de beschikbare BI-tool, terwijl je als Data Engineer meer bezig bent met de techniek achter het beschikbaar stellen van de data (en meestal) in de vorm van een datawarehouse.




Jouw verantwoordelijkheden

Je analyseert de informatiebehoefte en data;
Je ontwikkelt rapporten en dashboards;
Je ontwikkelt een datawarehouse en bijbehorende ETL-processen;
Je vertaalt klantvraagstukken naar passende en toekomstbestendige BI-architectuur;
Je komt tot resultaten waarmee de opdrachtgever echt blij is;
Je adviseert over het gebruik van managementinformatie.




Waar wij voor staan

Bij Solviteers werk je samen met een team van deskundige collega's om complexe IT-vraagstukken aan te pakken. Jouw bijdrage gaat verder dan waarde leveren aan klanten; het draagt direct bij aan positieve maatschappelijke impact. Binnen Solviteers staat professionele groei centraal, maar ook het plezier in samenwerken. Zo kan je naast goed samenwerken met professionals, ook op vrijwillige basis aansluiten bij leuke uitjes die georganiseerd worden door onze personeelsvereniging.




Jouw ontwikkeling

Bij Solviteers krijg je de kans om je breed te ontwikkelen en te ontdekken waar jouw kracht ligt. Hoewel je af en toe opdrachten krijgt die minder specifiek gericht zijn op één van onze stromingen binnen het BI-team, bieden deze juist de mogelijkheid om een veelzijdige professional te worden. Je kunt je nog steeds richten op specialisatie binnen jouw interessegebied, terwijl je jezelf tegelijkertijd blijft uitdagen met nieuwe, diverse opdrachten die jouw professionele groei stimuleren. In ons ervaren BI-team bouw je expertise op in verschillende rollen, met de ondersteuning van certificeringen en op maat gemaakte groeipaden. Als consultant ben je meer dan alleen een uitvoerder; jouw inbreng speelt een cruciale rol in de richting die we als team inslaan en in de verdere ontwikkeling van onze dienstverlening.




Wat breng je mee?

Om succesvol te zijn in deze rol is het belangrijk dat je analytische vaardigheden bezit en creatief bent in het bedenken van oplossingen. Jouw communicatieve vaardigheden en resultaatgerichtheid zorgen er daarnaast voor je dat je nieuwe concepten snel kunt oppakken, goed met stakeholders kan schakelen en flexibel bent in veranderende omstandigheden.




Wat je verder meeneemt:




Je hebt een hbo-/wo diploma, bij voorkeur op het gebied van BI of ICT;
Je hebt ervaring met BI-tools (Cognos of Power-BI);
Je hebt ervaring met SQL (Oracle of SQL-server);
Je hebt ervaring met methodieken zoals Scrum en Agile en hebt affiniteit met het inzichtelijk maken van data.




Wat we nog meer graag zouden zien, maar wat je ook bij ons kunt leren:




Je hebt bij voorkeur kennis van datawarehouse concepten en architecturen zoals Stermodelleren, Kimball en/of Data Vault;
Je hebt bij voorkeur ervaring met het ontwikkelen van datawarehouses (Oracle of Azure);
Je hebt bij voorkeur ervaring in de (lokale) overheid.




Wat krijg je van ons?

Een vast salaris tussen de €3.300 en €5.500
Winstuitkering en pensioenregeling
Maatwerk ontwikkelprogramma
12 ontwikkeldagen en 12 kennisdelingsdagen met collega’s
Eigen opleidingsbudget, waarvan een deel vrije keuze om jouw werk-/privébalans nog beter te maken (gadgets, sportschool of een comfortabele thuiswerkplek)

27 vakantiedagen o.b.v. fulltime
Hybride werken

Dan is deze rol geknipt voor jou.

Wij stellen organisaties in staat een duurzame omgang met grondstoffen op winstgevende wijze in hun bedrijfsvoering te integreren. Daarmee versnellen wij ‘het nieuwe normaal’ van een circulaire economie.




Wat ga je doen?

Thuis of op kantoor, als Data & Technology team starten wij de werkdag met een stand-up volgens de scrum-methodiek. Je praat je collega’s bij over de producten waar je gisteren aan gewerkt hebt, wat je prioriteiten voor vandaag zijn en wat nog niet helemaal is gelukt. Met als doel om tijdens de tweewekelijkse ‘sprint’ gezamenlijk iets moois op te kunnen leveren.

Als BI analist heb je een afwisselende baan; van het omzetten van data in begrijpelijke informatie, tot het in gesprek zijn met collega’s van andere afdelingen over een idee dat net is gepitcht en waarvoor een impactanalyse nodig is. Van het analyseren in SQL tot het visualiseren van data in Power BI.




Je zorgt voor het ophalen, controleren en verwerken van data. Vervolgens zet je deze om in begrijpelijke informatie en geeft hierover advies;
Je maakt rapportages en dashboards die naadloos aansluiten op de behoefte van de eindgebruiker, reken houdend met een gebruiksvriendelijke UI/UX;
Je geeft de Product Owner en de rest van product team advies over de beste oplossingen tijdens de discovery fase van een product ontwikkeling;
Het onderbouwen van bedrijfsprocessen aan de hand van statistieken, om daarna te helpen met het optimaliseren van deze processen;
Het trainen van de superusers en gebruikers in het gebruik van Power BI;
Actieve samenwerking met andere afdelingen voor een effectieve productontwikkeling;
Beheren van de enterprise rapportages en dashboards in Power BI;
Het uitvoeren van impactanalyse bij wijzigingen.




De ideale kandidaat

Is iemand die data-minded en analytisch goed onderbouwd is en energie haalt uit de samenwerking met collega’s van verschillende afdelingen en zich kan verplaatsen in de behoefte van de eindgebruiker. Daarnaast beschik je over:

kennis van Power BI en SQL ;
kennis van DAX measures;
kennis van data modellen volgens de Kimball standaard;
minimaal over HBO werk- en denkniveau met bij voorkeur een bedrijfskundige achtergrond. Ervaring in een data-analyse omgeving is een pré;
Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en beheersing van de Nederlandse taal in woord en geschrift;
Krijgt energie van agile-scrum werken.




Wat kan je van ons verwachten?

Een uitdagende baan waarbij je werkzaam bent in ons inspirerende kantoor in Rotterdam.
Hybride werken: een goede balans tussen thuis en op kantoor werken.
Professionele en leuke collega’s.

The commodity world is complex—it is fast-moving but traditional. These everyday products, from your morning coffee to the grains in your pasta, play a critical role in the global economy and in our daily lives.




Vesper is disrupting the commodity game. We are the fastest-growing commodity intelligence platform, trusted by giants like Nestlé, Unilever, and Danone. We combine cutting-edge AI with real-world data to give our customers the insights they need to win in a volatile market.




What we expect from this role




As our Business Intelligence Analyst, your mission is to derive actionable insights and opportunities from our internal data. There is an emphasis on product and usage behavior, but also financial and commercial data play an important role. You will help us build a smarter, faster business by providing data-informed answers to key questions like “How can we improve our retention?” or “What is our churn risk from certain customer segments?”.




You will partner closely with other teams and play an important role by building automated data pipelines, creating actionable insights while also enabling self-serve analytics to support our strategic and business decision-making.




We are looking for somebody who loves getting “into the data”, improving data-driven decision-making processes, translating business questions into BI solutions, applying analytics rigour to strategic questions and collaborating effectively with others.




If you like to jump on a high-speed train, enjoy all the learnings that come from a rapidly changing environment, get energy from having autonomy and enjoy an environment where decisions are made in a minute, this role might be for you!




What you will be doing




Generate accurate and reliable data insights: break down business problems and turn raw data into actionable insights around user behavior (e.g. customer retention, cost-usage analysis)
Enable data-informed decision making: empower all departments and management to make data-driven decisions by providing relevant automated dashboards, tailor-made insights or self-serve analytics where needed
Build and maintain data infrastructure: develop and optimize ETL pipelines to consolidate data from various raw data sources and integrate them into a unified database
Secure data reliability: ensure data is consistent, accurate and trustworthy – from collection to reporting

What you will bring




2-4 years experience in a role in Business Intelligence, Analytics, or a related field – ideally with previous experience in a fast-paced environment (scale-up, tech or product-driven organisation)
Strong analytical and problem solving skills – you break down complex problems using data and can translate ambiguous business questions into measurable insights
Solid technical foundation — you have proven skills in SQL and Python and are comfortable with data modeling, setting up and managing ETL processes, and database design (ideally with previous experience with Airflow)
Solid stakeholder management skills – you love to say “yes”, but definitely know when to say “no”. You keep everyone in the loop and can create a shared understanding across the team
Excellent communication skills — you speak both “data” and “human” and can work with technical peers and non-technical stakeholders
Business intuition — you understand how different parts of the business connect and how to prioritize what matters most
Autonomy & initiative – you don’t wait to be told what to do. You seek out problems, validate assumptions and propose solutions
An eye for detail — you take pride in clean, accurate data and high-quality wor
Bachelor or Master degree in a relevant field (e.g., Computer Science, Engineering, Data Science, Business Analytics)




What you get

Houd jij ervan om inzicht en overzicht te creëren? Dan zijn wij op zoek naar jou!




Wat ga je doen?

Als BI specialist bij Ziengs en Scapino ondersteun je de organisatie bij het verwerken en structureren van data om tot waardevolle analyses en inzichten te kunnen komen. Dit betekent dat je zorgt dat we de juiste data uit de verschillende bronnen kunnen halen en dat deze data gestructureerd en eenduidig wordt opgeslagen in het datawarehouse. Belangrijk daarbij is de kwaliteit en consistentie van de data te waarborgen, zodat je de juiste dataverbindingen en -combinaties kunt maken om tot optimale dashboards en rapportages te komen. Je helpt de organisatie daarmee om nog meer data gedreven te kunnen werken.




Je werkt nauw samen met key-users van de afdelingen om complexe vraagstukken op te lossen en waardevolle inzichten te ontwikkelen die de interne sturing en besluitvorming ondersteunen. Je weet de vraag van de klant goed in kaart te brengen en stemt in het ‘bouw’ proces regelmatig af over de voortgang en ook achteraf zorg je voor de juiste kwantitatieve en kwalitatieve controle.

Naast het uitbreiden en onderhouden van de bestaande BI-omgeving, help je ook bij het (opnieuw) vormgeven en combineren van data afkomstig uit nieuw te implementeren systemen, waaronder een ERP, maar mogelijk ook de implementatie en migratie van nieuwe BI tools.




Waar kom je te werken?

Als BI specialist werk je voor twee bekende ketens in de retailmarkt. Ziengs en Scapino hebben beide een rijke historie. Het zijn oer-Hollandse familiebedrijven met een focus op Retail en in het bijzonder schoenen. Gezamenlijk hebben de formules meer dan 250 winkels in Nederland en behoren we tot de grotere retailers van Nederland. Ziengs en Scapino kenmerken zich door een ondernemende cultuur. Passie voor schoenen, vakmanschap en ondernemerschap zijn hierbij belangrijke kernwaarden.




De afdeling BI is verantwoordelijk voor het verzamelen, verwerken en analyseren van data, het ontwikkelen van rapportages en dashboards en het verbeteren van de datakwaliteit binnen de organisatie.




Je komt te werken op ons servicekantoor in Assen.




Wie ben jij?

Jij bent iemand die pragmatisch kan werken in een dynamische omgeving. Je staat stevig in je (Ziengs of Scapino) schoenen en bent gewend om te schakelen tussen diverse niveaus binnen de organisatie. Je hebt een passie voor data en informatie en daarnaast heb je:

HBO werk- en denkniveau;
Minimaal 2-3 jaar ervaring in een vergelijkbare functie, bij voorkeur in een Retail organisatie;
Uitstekende kennis van SQL en BI tools als Tableau en/of Power BI;
Kennis van Alteryx, ETL en (BI) Cloud technologie is een pré;
Ervaring met het prepareren van data;
Een sterk analytisch en probleemoplossend vermogen;
Een resultaatgerichte, gestructureerde en pro-actieve werkhouding;
Sterke communicatieve vaardigheden waardoor jij o.a. als sparringpartner voor het management kan fungeren.




Wat bieden wij?

Markt conform salaris;
Personeelskorting;
24 vakantiedagen op basis van een fulltime dienstverband;
De mogelijkheid om deel te nemen aan onze gezamenlijke lunches op kantoor;
Een actieve personeelsvereniging;
De mogelijkheid tot deelname aan ons fietsplan;
Een uitdagende en dynamische werkomgeving waarin je belangrijke impact hebt binnen twee organisaties op het gebied van informatievoorziening en data gedreven werken;
Een informele werksfeer waar jij jezelf kunt zijn.

Als Analyst für Healthcare Analytics bist du Teil von Beratungsteams bei Klienten sowie von internen Projekten, Recherchen und Analysen zu Unternehmen und Trends in den europäischen Gesundheitssystemen. Wir sind Teil von McKinseys globalem Client Capability Network (CCN) mit mehr als 7.000 Kolleginnen und Kollegen, die unsere Klienten und Beratungsteams mit Expertise und Branchenanalysen unterstützen. Zur Verstärkung unseres Teams in Deutschland suchen wir dich zum nächstmöglichen Zeitpunkt als Analyst für Healthcare Analytics.

Das Healthcare Analytics Team nutzt Analysen und Daten aus dem Gesundheitswesen (z.B. Krankenversicherungen oder Gesundheitseinrichtungen), um einige der dringendsten Fragen unserer Klienten zu beantworten, wie zum Beispiel „Wie können wir die Kosten der Gesundheitsversorgung optimieren und gleichzeitig die Qualität verbessern?“, „Wie bleiben wir wettbewerbsfähig in der sich wandelnden Gesundheitslandschaft?“, „Wer sind die sensibelsten Patientengruppen und mit welchen Behandlungspfaden können wir ihre Versorgung verbessern?

Healthcare Analytics ist ein Team innerhalb der SHaPE-Practice (Social, Healthcare and Public Entities) mit Fokus auf die spezialisierte Beratung von Einrichtungen des Gesundheitswesens, insbesondere Kostenträger. Unser Ziel ist es mit der Unterstützung von Advanced Analytics und unseren standardisierten Methoden für Diagnostik, Optimierung und Implementierung für unsere Klienten positive und nachhaltige Veränderung zu erzielen.

Your Impact

In der Rolle als Analyst in Healthcare Analytics unterstützt du zum einen unsere Beratungsteams mit quantitativen und qualitativen Analysen und entwickelst unser Portfolio an analytischen Lösungen und innovativen Lösungsansätzen kontinuierlich weiter.

Zum anderen bist du ein fester Bestandteil der Beratungsteams beim Klienten vor Ort und bist somit direkt an der Erstellung von nachhaltigen Lösungen für unsere Klienten im Gesundheitssektor beteiligt. Letzteres erfordert Fähigkeiten im Projektmanagement und in der Kommunikation mit diversen Stakeholdern. Du wirst die Gelegenheit haben, aktiv mit Klienten aus verschiedenen Bereichen wie Krankenversicherungen, Leistungserbringern oder Private Equity zusammenzuarbeiten.

Im Healthcare Analytics Team handeln wir unternehmerisch. Daher suchen wir jemanden mit Motivation, kontinuierlich den Status Quo zu verbessern und dies auch eigenständig voranzutreiben.

Als Analyst wird erwartet, dass du Expertise in mindestens einem Segment des deutschen Gesundeitswesens (z.B. Krankenversicherungen oder Leistunserbringer) besitzt erste Erfahrungen bzw. eine Begeisterung für quantitative Analysen mitbringst. Darüber hinaus, hast du das Interesse dich in beiden Bereichen umfangreich fortzubilden und weiteres Wissen und Fähigkeiten zu erlangen.

Bei entsprechender Qualificiation ist eine Anstellung als Specialist möglich.

Your Qualifications and Skills


Mit sehr gutem Erfolg abgeschlossenes Master- oder Promotionsstudium im wirtschafts-, sozialwirtschafts- oder naturwissenschaftlichen Bereich mit optionalem Bezug zum Gesundheitswesen (u.a. Gesundheitsökonomie oder Healthcare Management)
2+ Jahre Berufserfahrung in einem relevanten Bereich (z.B. Krankenversicherung, Leistungserbringer, Beratung)
Leidenschaft für gesundheitsbezogene Themen (in Form von guten Kenntnissen der deutschen oder europäischen Gesundheitsbranche und dem Interesse sich in diesem Bereich weiterzubilden und zu spezialisieren)

Ausgezeichnete Problemlösungsfähigkeiten, insbesondere im analytischen und quantitativen Bereich
Ausgeprägtes unternehmerisches Handeln mit der Motivation, kontinuierlich den Status Quo zu verbessern und dies auch eigenständig voranzutreiben

Unternehmensprofil

„Am Anfang schaute ich mich um, konnte aber den Wagen, von dem ich träumte, nicht finden. Also beschloss ich, ihn mir selbst zu bauen.“

Dieser Satz von Ferry Porsche bringt alles auf den Punkt, was Porsche ausmacht. Als Marke, als Unternehmen, als Automobilhersteller, als Arbeitgeber. Die „Idee Porsche“ hat so einzigartige Sportwagen wie den Porsche 356 oder den 911 hervorgebracht. Durch die Kombination von Tradition und Innovation mit den Porsche typischen, manchmal etwas unkonventionellen Denkweisen unserer Mitarbeiter, lassen wir automobile Träume wahr werden und haben so immer das „Etwas-mehr“ im Blick. Porsche ist allerdings viel mehr als ""nur"" ein exklusiver Sportwagenhersteller. Denn auch als Arbeitgeber hat Porsche viel zu bieten: vielfältige Einstiegs- und Karrieremöglichkeiten, Maßnahmen zur Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie sowie flexible Arbeitszeitmodelle.

Exklusive Einblicke hinter die Kulissen

Unabhängig von dem, was andere tun, sind wir stets bestrebt, unsere Grenzen ständig neu zu definieren und Maßstäbe zu setzen. Das können wir heute und in Zukunft aber nur mit Mitarbeitern und Führungskräften erreichen, die immer das „Etwas-mehr“ im Blick haben.

Exklusive Einblicke in die Porsche Arbeitswelt erhalten Sie auch auf unseren Karriereprofilen in den sozialen Netzwerken:

„Porschecareers"" bei Instagram

„Porsche AG“ bei LinkedIn

DEINE ROLLE


Konzeption und Implementierung: Du trägst Verantwortung für die Konzeption und technische Implementierung von datengetriebenen Lösungen oder einzelnen Bestandteilen einer datengetriebenen Lösung.
Anforderungsmanagement: Gemeinsam mit Kunden, Usern und weiteren Stakeholdern erarbeitest du die relevanten Anforderungen und gestaltest mit ihnen innovative Lösungsideen, die diese Anforderungen erfüllen.
Datenanalyse und Modellierung: Deine Stärke liegt in der Aufbereitung und Analyse strukturierter und unstrukturierter Daten aus verschiedensten Datenquellen sowie in der Datenmodellierung. Dabei entwickelst du Analysen und Bewertungen von strategischen, prozessualen und methodischen Fragestellungen.
Prozessoptimierung: Du bringst Optimierungsvorschläge sowie Ideen proaktiv beim Kunden ein und implementierst Prozesse zur Datenqualitätssicherung.
Konzepterstellung: Zusammen mit unseren Datenarchitektinnen und -architekten konkretisierst du Konzepte zu umsetzungsreifen Entwürfen und bereitest gemeinsam mit unseren Data Engineers die Realisierung von Lösungen vor.
Projektunterstützung: Du unterstützt Projekte in allen Phasen, von der Anforderungsanalyse, dem Design, der Implementierung, hin zum Testing und der Produktivsetzung.

Begeisterung für Daten: „Bock auf Daten!“: Mit viel Begeisterung eignest du dir gerne neues Wissen zu Applikationen, Technologien und Tools im Data & Analytics Kontext an
Akademischer Hintergrund: Du hast ein abgeschlossenes Studium mit der Fachrichtung Wirtschaftsinformatik, Wirtschaftswissenschaften, Wirtschaftsingenieurwesen, Informatik oder einer vergleichbaren Fachrichtung.

Architekturverständnis: Du hast Freude daran, Architekturen aus fachlicher Perspektive zu konzipieren bzw. zu durchleuchten
Sprachkenntnisse: Sehr gute Deutsch- und gute Englischkenntnisse

Im Team Innovation Hub setzen wir Innovationsprojekte um, übernehmen die Verantwortung für die Data Governance und bauen eine nachhaltige Dateninfrastruktur auf. Mit technologischen Trends und innovativen Ideen entwickeln wir datenbasierte Lösungen, um die digitale Transformation im Einkauf voranzutreiben.

„Procurement Innovation is not about transactions – it‘s about Data“ [Sammeli Sammalkorpi, Sievo] Dieser Grundsatz ist für uns im Einkauf der EnBW Leitgedanke für die digitale Transformation.

Du weißt, dass es ein enges, vertrauensvolles Team braucht, um sich mit Mut am Nutzen zu orientieren und Neues zu wagen?

Du traust dich diese Ideen zu kommunizieren und umzusetzen, und nimmst gerne Herausforderungen an?

Unternehmensprofil

„Am Anfang schaute ich mich um, konnte aber den Wagen, von dem ich träumte, nicht finden. Also beschloss ich, ihn mir selbst zu bauen.“

Dieser Satz von Ferry Porsche bringt alles auf den Punkt, was Porsche ausmacht. Als Marke, als Unternehmen, als Automobilhersteller, als Arbeitgeber. Die „Idee Porsche“ hat so einzigartige Sportwagen wie den Porsche 356 oder den 911 hervorgebracht. Durch die Kombination von Tradition und Innovation mit den Porsche typischen, manchmal etwas unkonventionellen Denkweisen unserer Mitarbeiter, lassen wir automobile Träume wahr werden und haben so immer das „Etwas-mehr“ im Blick. Porsche ist allerdings viel mehr als ""nur"" ein exklusiver Sportwagenhersteller. Denn auch als Arbeitgeber hat Porsche viel zu bieten: vielfältige Einstiegs- und Karrieremöglichkeiten, Maßnahmen zur Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie sowie flexible Arbeitszeitmodelle.

Exklusive Einblicke hinter die Kulissen

Unabhängig von dem, was andere tun, sind wir stets bestrebt, unsere Grenzen ständig neu zu definieren und Maßstäbe zu setzen. Das können wir heute und in Zukunft aber nur mit Mitarbeitern und Führungskräften erreichen, die immer das „Etwas-mehr“ im Blick haben.

Exklusive Einblicke in die Porsche Arbeitswelt erhalten Sie auch auf unseren Karriereprofilen in den sozialen Netzwerken:

har förmåga att omvandla data till affärsinsikter
är bekväm med att jobba självständigt i SQL
har erfarenhet av, eller intresse för, att utvecklas inom Python eller R
kommunicerar på svenska och engelska




Vid eventuella frågor är du välkommen att kontakta BookBeats Growth Data Science Analytics Team Manager Christian Lönnquist på christian.lonnquist@bookbeat.com

AI & Data-teamet hjälper våra kunder att förbättra beslutsfattande genom datadrivna insikter och skapa insiktsdrivna organisationer. I teamets tekniska spår arbetar vi med implementering av lösningar inom AI, GenAI, cloud data platforms, data warehouse, BI/analytics. Vi har starkt fokus på data science, där kompetenser inom maskininlärning, statistisk analys och modellering är centrala för att leverera avancerade insikter och affärsvärde. Vår modell är on-the-job-training där du växer in i mer ansvarsfulla roller, men du kommer också att vidareutbilda dig i olika tekniska plattformar, t.ex. Google Cloud Platform, AWS, Azure, Snowflake och/eller Databricks.




Vårt rådgivande spår i teamet jobbar med data management, data governance och datastrategi. Här ser vi gärna att du har en mer traditionell managementkonsultutbildning kombinerad med data och teknik samt ett intresse för att arbeta med rådgivning. AI & Data-teamet verkar i en nordisk organisation med mycket kunskapskapital och kompetens så du kommer också att medverka i projekt, communities och utbildningar tillsammans med dina nordiska kollegor.




Engineering:




Hos Engineering-teamet kommer ditt fokus ligga på att hjälpa våra kunder att transformera sin affär genom planering och implementation av kritiska verksamhetssystem och molnplattformar. Teamet kombinerar teknik- och affärsexpertis inom systemutveckling och molnplattformar med bred projektledningsförmåga samt djup branscherfarenhet inom flera sektorer. Därmed kan vi stödja våra kunder genom hela sin system- och affärstransformationsresa från början till slut oavsett vilken fas de befinner sig i. Vårt erbjudande inkluderar bland annat utveckling av strategier, skräddarsydda plattformar, modernisering av applikationer, alla aspekter av molnteknik samt rådgivning kring alla delar av en systemimplementation.




Som Analyst i vårt team kommer du vara en del av våra kunders resa genom att stötta med roller inom t.ex. kravställning, systemutveckling, testning & projektledning. Du kommer att skaffa dig erfarenhet både genom kundprojekt men även genom att delta vid branschevent, specialiserad utbildning och certifieringsprogram.

Vi söker dig som är nyexaminerad ingenjör eller systemvetare med en masterexamen inom management eller data/data science/analytics eller finans. För att trivas bra i rollen bör du även vara utåtriktad och initiativrik samt drivs av nya utmaningar.

Hos oss får du arbeta med lösningar som gör verklig skillnad – både för koncernens strategiska riktning och i den operativa vardagen!




Om oss

Bonnier News är Nordens ledande mediekoncern. Med över 8 000 medarbetare – varav 2 500 är journalister – når vår journalistik över sex miljoner människor varje dag. Inom affärsområdet Commercial & Product, där cirka 1 000 personer arbetar, finns även Area Analytics och vårt dedikerade BI-team, som ansvarar för att utveckla och tillgängliggöra analyslösningar för hela koncernen.




Vårt uppdrag är tydligt – vi ska bidra till ett mer datadrivet Bonnier News, där journalistik, affär och strategi möts i smarta och tillförlitliga lösningar. Att försvara det fria ordet är centralt för oss – och data är ett av våra viktigaste verktyg i den strävan.




Om rollen

Som Data & BI Analyst blir du en viktig del av vårt centrala BI-team, där du ansvarar för att utveckla och tillgängliggöra datadrivna lösningar som möjliggör både strategiska och operativa beslut inom redaktion, annons- och prenumerationsaffären.




Det här är en bred roll där du får kombinera tekniskt djup med affärsnära analys. Du kommer att arbeta tillsammans med fem andra Data & BI Analysts i ett sammansvetsat och framåtlutat team som är en del av Area Analytics – en organisation som samlar omkring 50 analytiker inom Bonnier News. Du rapporterar till vår Analytics Manager Business Intelligence och har ett nära samarbete med nyckelpersoner från hela verksamheten.




I rollen kommer du både att bidra till teamets gemensamma uppdrag och självständigt driva initiativ utifrån ett BI-perspektiv. Du arbetar nära stakeholders i olika delar av organisationen och är med och skapar insikter som gör skillnad – från detaljerad kampanjanalyser till koncernövergripande rapporter som används av ledningsgruppen.




Vi har ett starkt fokus på samarbete och kunskapsdelning, och strävar efter att våra arbetssätt, leveranser och dataprodukter ska vara enhetliga, tillförlitliga och långsiktigt hållbara. Under det senaste året har vi jobbat målinriktat med att kvalitetssäkra dataflöden och bygga gemensamma modeller. Framåt vill vi fortsätta konsolidera våra lösningar och ser därför gärna att du har ett strategiskt tänk, ett öga för struktur – och ett intresse för att bygga BI-lösningar som håller över tid.




Rollen innebär att du:

- Bygger och vidareutvecklar dashboards, rapporter och visualiseringar som skapar insikter.

- Utvecklar och förvaltar datamodeller (mart) och BI-infrastruktur i t.ex. BigQuery och dbt.

- Säkerställer datakvalitet, konsistens, struktur och governance i hela datakedjan.

- Identifierar förbättringsområden och har hög kritisk förmåga.

- Bidrar med att skapa enhetlighet och insikter.

- Samarbetar med andra team i Data och Analys.




Vem är du?

Vi söker dig som är driven, affärsorienterad och tekniskt kunnig med ett intresse för att förstå affären och bidra till koncernens strategiska mål. Du har erfarenhet av att skapa strukturerade och användarvänliga BI-lösningar i komplexa miljöer. Du drivs av att förstå affären och använda data som verktyg för att påverka beslut. Du trivs i en miljö där samarbete, nyfikenhet och kunskapsdelning står i centrum.




Kvalifikationer:

- Högskoleutbildning inom exempelvis dataingenjör, datavetenskap, ekonomi eller statistik.

- 2–5 års erfarenhet från en roll som BI-analytiker, dataanalytiker eller analytics engineer.

- Mycket goda kunskaper i SQL.

- Erfarenhet av BI-verktyg som Looker, Qlik, Tableau eller liknande.

- God förmåga att kommunicera datainsikter till icke-tekniska målgrupper.

- Flytande i svenska i både tal och skrift.

- Erfarenhet av att arbeta med datamodellering i BigQuery, dBt eller liknande verktyg.

- Erfarenhet för hur man bygger hållbar BI-infrastruktur.

- Erfarenhet av att arbeta med Airflow eller liknande ETL-verktyg.

- Erfarenhet av att driva större projekt och god presentationsförmåga.




Övrig information

Tjänsten är en tillsvidareanställning med 6 månaders provanställning.

Du tillhör Bonnier News Analys och rapporterar till Analytics Manager Business Intelligence. Vi sitter i Tidningshuset på Gjörwellsgatan 30, Kungsholmen i Stockholm – med flexibilitet kring distansarbete.




Du behöver inte bifoga ett personligt brev – besvara våra urvalsfrågor och ladda upp ditt CV. Urvalsprocessen innehåller telefonintervju, tester, intervju med case och referenstagning.

Som analytiker hos oss får du en central roll i att samla in, bearbeta och analysera information som påverkar allt från bredbandsutbyggnad till internationella jämförelser. Vill du vara med och skapa en tydligare bild av utvecklingen inom bredband, telekom och digitalisering? Då kan det här vara rollen för dig!




Vi jobbar med det alla tar för givet. Att kunna kommunicera. Hos oss får du se till att det fungerar nu och i framtiden. För alla.




Enheten för marknadsanalys och statistik jobbar med att tillgodose myndighetens dataförsörjning. I det ingår att samla in, kvalitetssäkra, förvara, gallra och analysera data, som även publiceras för allmänheten och skickas in för internationellt jämförbara mått. Data som samlas in av enheten utgör grunden för mycket av myndighetens kärnprocesser, som att tilldela stöd, reglera bredbandsmarknaden, tilldela frekvenser och främja bredbandstillgången.




”Jag som kommer att bli din chef heter Bianca Gustafsson Kojo. För mig är det viktigt att visa tillit och ge medarbetarna utrymme att ta ansvar och självständigt driva frågor utifrån sitt ansvarområde. För att stötta dig är det viktigt att jag är tillgänglig och att vi har en bra dialog som baseras på ett informellt samtalsklimat och tydlighet i förväntningar från min sida. Du bidrar med att lyfta vad du behöver för förutsättningar för att göra ett bra jobb och vi arbetar tillsammans för att lyckas med uppdraget och trivas på jobbet.”




Om rollen

Som analytiker på enheten deltar du i, eller leder, datainsamlingar och databearbetningar i syfte att sprida information om marknaden för elektronisk kommunikation. Rapporterna som enheten producerar har ett brett användningsområde, både utanför PTS och internt på myndigheten och insamlade data bidrar i flera av myndighetens kärnprocesser som reglering, spektrumtilldelning och främjande. I arbetsuppgifterna ingår hela processen för statistikinsamling, från behovsinventering och frågeformulering till databearbetning, kvalitetssäkring, analys och rapportskrivning.




Du kommer att ha kontakter internt på myndigheten för att säkerställa att behov av data fångas och presenterar resultat av genomförda insamlingar. Till detta kommer att delta i projekt som drivs från andra avdelningar på myndigheten där din roll blir att förse projekten med den data som behövs. I arbetet ingår även att ha kontakter med externa aktörer, framförallt operatörer, både i kvalitetssäkrande syfte och för att informera, förklara och förankra våra insamlingar.




Om teamet

Enheten består av ett blandat gäng, med en balans mellan män och kvinnor och spridning i åldrar. Vi har både ekonomer, geografer, statsvetare, jurist och statistiker placerade hos oss. Vi stöttar varandra och strävar efter att alla medarbetare ska få möjlighet att utvecklas genom att arbeta med olika frågor och för att leveranssäkra vår verksamhet.




Om dig

För att trivas i rollen ser vi att du är samarbetsorienterad och kan lyfta dina egna perspektiv samtidigt som du lyssnar på andras. Du delar aktivt med dig av din kunskap och strävar efter att hitta gemensamma lösningar. Genom att anpassa presentationer av kvantitativa underlag efter målgruppen, både i tal och skrift säkerställer du att budskapet tas väl emot. Vidare är du lösningsorienterad och har förmågan att prioritera ditt arbete självständigt, även när förutsättningarna förändras. Du behåller fokus på leveransen, gör kloka avvägningar mellan tid, kvalitet och resurser samt hittar vägar framåt även i mer intensiva arbetsfaser. För oss är dina personliga egenskaper viktiga, därför kommer vi lägga stor vikt vid dessa.




Vi söker dig som har:

Akademisk examen med inriktning mot statistik, statsvetenskap, ekonomi, geografi eller motsvarande.
Flerårig erfarenhet av att bearbeta och analysera data med hjälp av SQL, R, Stata eller liknande.
Erfarenhet av utredningsarbete och analys.
Mycket god förmåga av att uttrycka dig i tal och skrift på svenska.




Det är även meriterande om du har:

Erfarenhet av arbete inom offentlig förvaltning.
Erfarenhet av arbete med GIS program (QGIS, ArcGIS, MapInfo, m.m.).
Erfarenhet av datainsamling och/eller kunskap om den nationella statistikproduktionen.




Vårt erbjudande

Vi tar livet på allvar. Hos oss kan du ha ett liv på och utanför jobbet. Mår du bra, mår vi bra. Därför erbjuder vi konkurrenskraftiga löner, flexibla arbetstider och möjlighet till distansarbete. Vi har även generöst friskvårdsbidrag och två friskvårdstimmar varje vecka.




Dessutom får du förmånliga villkor för lunch, semester, föräldraledighet, pension och vid sjukdom. Här kommer du arbeta i moderna aktivitetsbaserade lokaler på Hälsingegatan 38. Som statlig myndighet erbjuder vi en trygg och stabil arbetsmiljö där du kan känna dig säker. Vi skapar morgondagens samhälle och måste ligga i framkant. Hos oss kommer du att växa med uppgifter hela tiden.




Bra att veta

Tjänsten är en tillsvidareanställning med inledande provanställning om sex månader. Placering i Stockholm med start snarast möjligt enligt överenskommelse.




För att vi ska kunna göra en rättvis och objektiv bedömning av din kompetens ber vi dig att inte inkludera bild, personnummer eller adress i ditt CV. Vi har valt att inte efterfråga personligt brev då vi istället använder urvalsfrågor. Detta för att vi vill lägga fokus på din erfarenhet och kompetens, vilket bidrar till en mer effektiv och rättvis rekryteringsprocess. Tester kommer att ingå i processen. Om du har skyddade uppgifter, vänligen kontakta vår HR-specialist.




För ytterligare information, vänligen kontakta enhetschef Bianca Gustafsson Kojo på bianca.gustafssonkojo@pts.se eller HR-specialist Jessica Petersson på jessica.petersson@pts.se.

Vill du vara med i en förflyttning där du sitter nära verksamheten och har möjlighet att påverka våra affärsbeslut? Som Sveriges största försäkringsbolag inom sakförsäkring så sitter vi på stora mängder outforskade data som bara väntar på att ge oss nya insikter. Anta utmaningen nu och få Sveriges bästa kollegor i nyrenoverade och fräscha lokaler på Tegeluddsvägen.

Om jobbet

Aktuarie & Analys är en del av Affärsenhet Sak med uppdrag att leverera aktuariella och analytiska tjänster samt beslutstöd kopplat till länsförsäkringsgruppens sakförsäkringsaffär. Avdelningen har en central roll i den pågående transformationen.

Vi söker nu en Affärsutvecklare som kommer att leda utvecklingsinitiativ (epics) inom prissättning, lönsamhetsstyrning, dataintegration och beslutstöd. Uppdraget som Epic Owner kommer att spela en avgörande roll för att vi ska nå våra högt satta mål och framgångsrikt driva förändring inom organisationen. Du kommer att identifiera behov och omfattning av förändring, skapa en tydlig färdplan och utveckla välgrundade beslutsunderlag. Du kommer att vara en länk mellan oss på Aktuarie & Analys och våra intressenter, säkerställa kommunikation och att vi tillsammans arbetar i rätt riktning.

Dina huvudsakliga ansvarsområden kommer vara att:


Leda och facilitera arbetet med att detaljera utvecklingsinitiativ och sammanställa bedömning av deras värde för portföljstyrningen.
Säkerställa att risker identifieras och analyseras enligt beslutade processer och styrdokument.
Ansvara för nedbrytning av epics till features och prioritering i relevanta backlogs.
Koordinera aktiviteter rörande epics med inblandade portföljer, lean-agila tåg och utvecklingsteam samt säkerställa dialog och samverkan mellan intressenter och specialister.


Vem är du?

Vi söker dig som brinner för affär och dess möjlighet att dra nytta av ny teknik. Du har relevant akademisk examen och erfarenhet av att leda utvecklingsinitiativ. Genom din erfarenhet har du god förståelse för den tekniska förflyttning som genomförs och är van att ha dialog med IT-arkitekter och andra specialister. Du trivs med att växla perspektivet från det strategiska till det mer operativa.

Som Affärsutvecklare och Epic Owner ser vi att du har förmågan att analysera och förklara komplexa affärsproblem, utveckla effektiva lösningar och fatta väl avvägda beslut. Du behöver kunna planera och samordna arbetet och samarbeta med olika avdelningar. Vidare är det viktigt att du har en god kommunikativ förmåga i både tal och skrift. För att vara framgångsrik tror vi även att du har erfarenhet av att arbeta inom en liknande organisation och att driva lean-agil affärsutveckling och förändringsledning, gärna utifrån SAFe-ramverket.

Om oss

Vi erbjuder en inspirerande och stimulerande roll där du blir en nyckelspelare i vår spännande resa mot en alltmer datadriven verksamhet. Detta är en chans att sätta din prägel på och förverkliga LFAB-koncernens framtidsvision. Du kommer att bli del av ett dynamiskt och professionellt team inom Affärsutveckling.

Role Summary

Our department plays an important role in Scania’s data strategy to deliver top analytical solutions. We enable and enhance data to empower our employees to perform at their best by providing excellent solutions that increase and secure the right decisions to reach and exceed business goals.

Vi söker en Data Engineer som vill arbeta i ett engagerat team där samarbete, framdrift och lärande står i centrum. Här får du möjligheten att driva utvecklingen med en avancerad datahantering i en Microsoft-miljö. Låter det som något för dig? Ansök då rollen redan idag!

Att jobba som Data Engineer

Som Data Engineer på Skandiabanken kommer du att vara en central del av vårt team som utvecklar vårt nya Data Warehouse. Arbetet består av att lyfta lösningen till en ny bankgemensam dataplattform on-prem och förbereder för en framtida molnförflyttning. Likväl kommer du vara med att underhålla och drifta befintlig lösning. Du kommer att bygga och optimera data pipelines samt säkerställa att vår datahantering är både effektiv och säker. Rollen innebär att du kommer få jobba tätt tillsammans med verksamheten för att tillmötesgå deras behov. Du förväntas att även coacha och utbilda juniora kollegor.

Teamet består idag av Data Engineers, Produktägare och Lösningsarkitekt, där alla sitter på kontoret vid Lindhagensgatan 86 i Stockholm. Vi som team kännetecknas av en hög framdrift där stor vikt läggs vid samarbete för att lyckas. Vi lär av varandra genom kontinuerliga workshops och uppmuntrar en kultur där vi vågar lyfta idéer, litar på varandra och utvecklas tillsammans. Vi är ett agilt team som jobbar enligt SAFe metoden.

Vi arbetar hybrid, vilket innebär arbete på kontoret varvat med distansarbete. I rollen kommer du att rapportera till vår gruppchef inom Data & Analytics inom Skandiabanken.

,

För att lyckas i rollen

Vi ser att du som person är stöttande, samarbetsvillig och trivs i en miljö där teamwork står i centrum. Du har ett driv och målmedvetenhet att utveckla både dig själv och andra. För att lyckas så är det naturligt att vara kommunikativ och ha en tillit till varandra för att bygga ett starkt team.

Du har mångårig erfarenhet inom Data Warehouse-utveckling i en on-prem Microsoft-miljö. Dessutom har du har god förståelse och kunskap inom datamodellering och ETL-utveckling. Rollen kräver att du kan svenska flytande både i tal och skrift.

Det är meriterande men ingen nödvändighet om du har arbetat med Data Vault och har erfarenhet av DWA-verktyg.

Vad händer nu?

Vi jobbar med löpande urval så tveka inte att skicka in din ansökan redan idag. I ansökan kommer vi att ställa ett antal urvalsfrågor som ligger till grund för urvalet.

För att göra rekryteringsprocessen så rättvis och objektiv som möjligt kommer det att ingå intervjuer, tester via Alva Labs, bakgrundskontroll samt digital referenstagning.

Om du har frågor kring rollen vänligen ta kontakt med rekryterande chef Markus Lundholm på markus.lundholm@skandia.se.

Om du har frågor kopplat till rekryteringsprocessen maila harald.brehmer@skandia.se.

Vi ser fram emot din ansökan!

Hos oss får du arbeta med lösningar som gör verklig skillnad – både för koncernens strategiska riktning och i den operativa vardagen!




Om oss

Bonnier News är Nordens ledande mediekoncern. Med över 8 000 medarbetare – varav 2 500 är journalister – når vår journalistik över sex miljoner människor varje dag. Inom affärsområdet Commercial & Product, där cirka 1 000 personer arbetar, finns även Area Analytics och vårt dedikerade BI-team, som ansvarar för att utveckla och tillgängliggöra analyslösningar för hela koncernen.




Vårt uppdrag är tydligt – vi ska bidra till ett mer datadrivet Bonnier News, där journalistik, affär och strategi möts i smarta och tillförlitliga lösningar. Att försvara det fria ordet är centralt för oss – och data är ett av våra viktigaste verktyg i den strävan.




Om rollen

Som Data & BI Analyst blir du en viktig del av vårt centrala BI-team, där du ansvarar för att utveckla och tillgängliggöra datadrivna lösningar som möjliggör både strategiska och operativa beslut inom redaktion, annons- och prenumerationsaffären.




Det här är en bred roll där du får kombinera tekniskt djup med affärsnära analys. Du kommer att arbeta tillsammans med fem andra Data & BI Analysts i ett sammansvetsat och framåtlutat team som är en del av Area Analytics – en organisation som samlar omkring 50 analytiker inom Bonnier News. Du rapporterar till vår Analytics Manager Business Intelligence och har ett nära samarbete med nyckelpersoner från hela verksamheten.




I rollen kommer du både att bidra till teamets gemensamma uppdrag och självständigt driva initiativ utifrån ett BI-perspektiv. Du arbetar nära stakeholders i olika delar av organisationen och är med och skapar insikter som gör skillnad – från detaljerad kampanjanalyser till koncernövergripande rapporter som används av ledningsgruppen.




Vi har ett starkt fokus på samarbete och kunskapsdelning, och strävar efter att våra arbetssätt, leveranser och dataprodukter ska vara enhetliga, tillförlitliga och långsiktigt hållbara. Under det senaste året har vi jobbat målinriktat med att kvalitetssäkra dataflöden och bygga gemensamma modeller. Framåt vill vi fortsätta konsolidera våra lösningar och ser därför gärna att du har ett strategiskt tänk, ett öga för struktur – och ett intresse för att bygga BI-lösningar som håller över tid.




Rollen innebär att du:

- Bygger och vidareutvecklar dashboards, rapporter och visualiseringar som skapar insikter.

- Utvecklar och förvaltar datamodeller (mart) och BI-infrastruktur i t.ex. BigQuery och dbt.

- Säkerställer datakvalitet, konsistens, struktur och governance i hela datakedjan.

- Identifierar förbättringsområden och har hög kritisk förmåga.

- Bidrar med att skapa enhetlighet och insikter.

- Samarbetar med andra team i Data och Analys.




Vem är du?

Vi söker dig som är driven, affärsorienterad och tekniskt kunnig med ett intresse för att förstå affären och bidra till koncernens strategiska mål. Du har erfarenhet av att skapa strukturerade och användarvänliga BI-lösningar i komplexa miljöer. Du drivs av att förstå affären och använda data som verktyg för att påverka beslut. Du trivs i en miljö där samarbete, nyfikenhet och kunskapsdelning står i centrum.




Kvalifikationer:

- Högskoleutbildning inom exempelvis dataingenjör, datavetenskap, ekonomi eller statistik.

- 2–5 års erfarenhet från en roll som BI-analytiker, dataanalytiker eller analytics engineer.

- Mycket goda kunskaper i SQL.

- Erfarenhet av BI-verktyg som Looker, Qlik, Tableau eller liknande.

- God förmåga att kommunicera datainsikter till icke-tekniska målgrupper.

- Flytande i svenska i både tal och skrift.

- Erfarenhet av att arbeta med datamodellering i BigQuery, dBt eller liknande verktyg.

- Erfarenhet för hur man bygger hållbar BI-infrastruktur.

- Erfarenhet av att arbeta med Airflow eller liknande ETL-verktyg.

- Erfarenhet av att driva större projekt och god presentationsförmåga.




Övrig information

Tjänsten är en tillsvidareanställning med 6 månaders provanställning.

Du tillhör Bonnier News Analys och rapporterar till Analytics Manager Business Intelligence. Vi sitter i Tidningshuset på Gjörwellsgatan 30, Kungsholmen i Stockholm – med flexibilitet kring distansarbete.




Du behöver inte bifoga ett personligt brev – besvara våra urvalsfrågor och ladda upp ditt CV. Urvalsprocessen innehåller telefonintervju, tester, intervju med case och referenstagning.

Location: Stockholm, Helsinki




At Bonava we are not only building houses, but we are also creating homes and neighbourhoods where people live their lives. As a data engineer at Bonava you will design and build data flows between different systems and write efficient code to transform data for various services to ensure that our users have the data they need in their applications.




The role

In this role you will design, build, maintain and optimise data pipelines in Microsoft Synapse Analytics and their related components in Microsoft Azure, such as Logic Apps and Azure Functions. You will work with relevant stakeholders to understand the requirements, draft solutions that follow our internal guidelines and then develop these. You will write code in PySpark (a mix between Python and SQL that runs on Spark) to ingest, transform, and store data automatically in efficient ways in our data lake. You will also build algorithms to extract, create and transform data that will be used to deliver new insights to the business. Finally, you will contribute to the continuous improvement of our data platform.




The way we work

The team you will be joining is a distributed team of 8 persons split between Stockholm, Helsinki, and Berlin. As the Data-team we cover everything from integrations to reporting and AI. We use a hybrid setup, mixing remote work with working from the office.




We work in an agile way aiming for small frequent releases using guiding principles from the software development world. Our tech stack is mostly within Microsoft Azure, where we are using PySpark and Synapse Analytics heavily for data engineering and analysis and Microsoft Power BI for reporting. For integrations we focus mainly on Data Factory/Synapse Analytics, Logic Apps, Azure Functions and API management.




Who we are looking for?

For this role you need to both enjoy writing code and have a clear interest in understanding the business and the data. You learn new technical tools quickly when you have the proper support. Working independently is something you are used to, but you are also comfortable with asking for help and helping your colleagues when needed. You have a high attention to details, and you understand the importance of both correctness in the data and prioritisation.




We believe you have a MSc in computer science, data science or information systems.




Skills & Requirements

Required

Experience in PySpark (preferred) or in SQL + Python
Experience of building data pipelines in Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse Analytics
Experience of making API calls to extract data
Knowledge of relational databases, SQL, modelling of data and normalisation of data structures
Knowledge of complexity, optimisation, and characteristics of less and more efficient algorithms
Professional level in English




Meriting

It is also meriting if you have experience of any of the following:

PySpark (strongly preferred)
Git and CI/CD
Azure DevOps
Azure Logic Apps
Azure Functions
Azure API Management




Join our journey

When you apply, please submit your resume and cover letter in English together with relevant grade transcripts. We are reviewing applications continuously, so please send your application as soon as possible but no later than May 18, 2025.




If you have any specific questions, please contact Helena Sjöberg at helena.sjoberg@bonava.com, the recruiting manager.

At Lunar we are democratizing the power of money and changing the way we all bank, pay, and invest. Since starting in Aarhus in 2015, we've grown rapidly and are now a major player in the Nordics, with offices in Copenhagen, Aarhus and Stockholm 🚀




So who are we? Are we a tech company or a bank? Well, we're both, breaking free from the usual categories. Here, tech isn't just a cool add-on; it's the core of how we do things. With our own banking license, we go head-to-head with traditional banks. What sets us apart is the mix of tech and financial services, giving us the power to shake up a dusty industry that's ready for a change.

You’ll be based in Copenhagen, embedded within our Audience and Acquisition team, reporting to Sally Armstrong. The team currently comprises 5 amazing individuals focused on leveraging data-driven insights to fuel customer acquisition and engagement within the broader Marketing function, led by Manuel Douchez. But you’ll be the one steering the marketing analytics ship - driving strategy, developing methodologies, and making sure data is at the heart of every decision we make.

Establish and implement best practices for data analysis, reporting, and visualization, ensuring marketing performance is continuously improved.

Vi har sammen med vores kollegaer i Medlemsteamet kontakten til medlemmerne og har styr på foreningens vedtægter og en stor mængde medlemsdata, der skal håndteres korrekt. Vi arbejder for at sikre de bedst mulige betingelser for at kunne yde professionel medlemsservice og videreudvikle de administrative processer i forhold til dette.

Keep reading; we are looking for a Quantitative Analyst to join our newly established Macro Trading team.







In Macro Trading, we combine macroeconomic insights and data analysis with market-specific knowledge of power, gas, and emissions to generate trading decisions. The macro portfolio is like a start-up with a high degree of autonomy and the opportunity to explore new ideas to innovate and rethink European Energy Trading, while having the backing of a larger and mature organization, increasing the probability of success.




As a Quantitative Analyst, you will be key in building our quantitative macroeconomic framework. Additionally, you will collaborate closely with traders, quants, and other analysts to develop quantifiable and actionable analysis.




Your journey as a Quantitative Analyst

We seek a highly analytical and detail-oriented Quantitative Analyst with a dedicated focus on macroeconomics and econometrics to support our energy trading activities. In this role, you will leverage macroeconomic data—such as interest rates, inflation, and growth - and advanced econometric techniques to create proprietary models that forecast market prices and support our trading strategies.




The ideal candidate will have a deep understanding of the global macroeconomic landscape and how it influences commodity prices, energy supply, and demand, paired with exceptional skills in econometric modeling and quantitative research.




We will ensure you are ready to take on your new role by giving you the best possible introduction to the team, our business, and our organization. You will be introduced to our macroeconomic framework, and any potential knowledge gaps will be addressed to maximize your success.




At InCommodities, we do not believe in bureaucracy, stringent processes, or micro-management. Instead, we grant you high autonomy, which we believe unlocks greater engagement and ensures that the best decisions are made – always by those closest to the job.'




Key Responsibilities

Develop and implement econometric models that predict key macroeconomic variables
Incorporate macroeconomic factors to predict energy prices and supply-demand dynamics
Collaborate with traders and quants to translate macroeconomic data and econometric insights into actionable trading strategies.
Continuously monitor and refine models to reflect changes in the macroeconomic environment




Qualifications – we imagine that you:

Hold a master’s degree or PhD in Economics, Finance, or a similar field with a focus on econometrics
Have experience with time-series analysis, forecasting, and other advanced econometric techniques
Possess excellent coding skills (Python is an advantage)
Preferably have knowledge of energy markets (oil, natural gas, electricity)
Have great communication skills enabling you to present complex macroeconomic insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders




Personal skills – we expect that you:

Are super passionate and knowledgeable about econometrics
Actively follow and understand what is happening in the world of macroeconomics
Have a curious and competitive mindset
Can be direct with your colleagues in a constructive way
Can work independently with a strong drive towards achieving results
Are a team player who will do what is best for the team and InCommodities




What you can expect from us:

You will join a team of experienced colleagues and will have the opportunity to work closely together with quants, analysts, and traders to build a macro trading desk
We will provide you with opportunities to develop both professionally and personally
We will provide you with flexibility and autonomy to drive real impact
You will be part a unique company culture where we live up to our values: Honesty, Transparency, and Rethink and where you don't have to abide by a dress code or a strict hierarchy, so you won't be frustrated with too many rules, policies, or bureaucratic processes.

Location: Aarhus N, Denmark

Lunar is revolutionizing Nordic banking, and we need a Senior Business Data Analyst to optimize monetization, sales, and partnerships across our private and business platforms.

At Lunar we are democratizing the power of money and changing the way we all bank, pay, and invest. Since starting in Aarhus in 2015, we've grown rapidly and are now a major player in the Nordics, with offices in Copenhagen, Aarhus and Stockholm 🚀

So who are we? Are we a tech company or a bank? Well, we're both, breaking free from the usual categories. Here, tech isn't just a cool add-on; it's the core of how we do things. With our own banking license, we go head-to-head with traditional banks. What sets us apart is the mix of tech and financial services, giving us the power to shake up a dusty industry that's ready for a change.

As we continue our journey to becoming the best everyday bank in the Nordics, we are looking for a Senior Business Data Analyst to drive data-driven decision-making across monetization, sales, and partnerships so that we can optimize growth and commercial impact.

Sales Lead Generation & Performance: Leverage data to improve lead generation and develop predictive sales models.

Partnership Performance Analysis: Evaluate ROI and track performance of strategic partnerships.

Price & Deposit Analysis: Conduct pricing and deposit trend analysis and provide competitive insights.

Data-Driven Insights & Reporting: Extract, clean, and analyze data to generate actionable business insights.

Curious about the Lunar culture? 💚

Everything at Lunar centers around our core - to challenge. It’s infused into our four values and guides us in how to work together, lead projects, and lead people to reach our mission. Our values aren't just words on a page - they're what make us who we are and shape the vibe of our culture. And trust me, we’re all about the vibe. For a longer read about our culture, click here.

We're excited to welcome everyone to apply for this impactful role! We can’t wait to follow up with talents who we believe are the best fit based on the following criteria:

Who are you?

3-7 years experience as a Data Analyst (commercial/fintech/banking preferred).

Ability to analyze large datasets and extract key trends.

Strong understanding of commercial KPIs.

DNK-Randers, Danish Crown Vej

Commercial Insight Specialist

Do you want to accelerate your career in an international food company? Do you have a solid analytical mindset and thrive in a data-driven environment? Are you motivated by creating actionable business insights from large datasets? Then you might be the Commercial Insight Specialist we are looking for.

Join us on our journey towards creating a more sustainable future for food

Danish Crown is on a transformation journey to becoming an international food company through a dedicated focus on creating even better products and brands for the benefit of consumers. In our Commercial Insight team, we contribute to this journey by turning data into fact-based insights and recommendations for how to deliver on the commercial agenda. As our new Commercial Insight Specialist, you will join a team of five skilled and dedicated colleagues who are working together in a professional and informal atmosphere to deliver the best solutions for our stakeholders. The team is anchored in our Global Sales & Categories organization, and we are responsible for driving key processes around commercial development and insights.

Gain Valuable Experience With Commercial Tasks

Specifically, you will become part of the Commercial Insight team that supports our global sales and category organizations with analytical tools, insights, and recommendations for data-driven commercial decision-making. Together with your colleagues you will be working on quantitative analyses that provide insights into our categories and customers. We are working as internal consultants and you will be involved in all phases of the analysis, from defining the problem, driving the analysis, translating it into actionable recommendations and presenting your results. You will be the go-to person for selected sales and category teams, while you will also assume responsibility for some of our tools and data sources.

Your Tasks And Responsibilities Will Include


Acting as a trusted advisor for sales and category organisations on commercial insight topics
Analysing and optimizing our categories and customers from a data-driven perspective
Supporting on annual customer negotiations and category deep dives etc.
Preparing materials for presentations and communicating your findings to stakeholders
Developing tools and reports for the commercial business


Who are you?

You have a master’s degree within business or economics (e.g. cand.merc, cand.oecon or the like). Ideally, you have 2-4 years of experience from a similar position as Business Analyst, Data Analyst or Commercial Analyst. Alternatively, you can also be newly graduated with relevant experience from student job or internship. In both cases, you have above average skills in Excel and PowerPoint. If you have experience with PowerBI, PowerQuery or Think-cell it is a plus. You are proficient in both English and Danish.

As a person you are enthusiastic about working with numbers and see data as your most valuable resource. You can apply your commercial understanding to convert data into actionable insights and recommendations. At the same time, you manage to convey your messages through simple and visual PowerPoint-presentations. You are structured and thorough in your work and able to navigate ad hoc tasks and long-term projects at the same time. You have a good amount of curiosity and are motivated by following your tasks all the way through - even if there are bumps on the way there.

What do we offer? Glad that you asked!

Danish Crown isn't just a big player in the food industry; it's also a workplace with top-notch facilities and a lifestyle-oriented approach to employee well-being. Our brand new, sustainable headquarters (DGNB Heart Certification) provides an inspiring environment designed to foster collaboration and creativity.

In this position, you will have the opportunity to work closely with multiple stakeholders in one of Denmark's leading food companies. For the right candidate, the position can therefore also be a steppingstone towards a career in a large international food company.

Appetite for more?

If you are curious to hear more about the position before handing in your CV and motivated application, you are more than welcome to contact Director, Andreas Muff on +45 3089 1385.

Please send your CV and cover letter as soon as possible in Danish or English, as we evaluate and contact candidates continuously. We will remove the post once the right candidate is selected.

We are a food company owned by Danish farmers supplying high-quality food to customers and consumers all over the world. From butchers to business developers, we’re more than 23,000 colleagues, all committed to lowering our carbon footprint and becoming climate neutral by 2050, for better food and a brighter future.

Imagine if there was something we could all change today that would reduce global warming by 10%. That’s how much food waste contributes to the climate crisis, and yet we continue to waste edible food all over the world.

As the world’s largest food waste-fighting app, we connect stores that have unsold, surplus food with consumers who buy and enjoy it. But we’re more than an app: we are a certified B Corporation and our mission is to inspire and empower everyone to take action against food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 118 million registered users and 246,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 443+ million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.198.000 tonnes of CO2e!

This role is based in Amsterdam OR Copenhagen.

Your mission

We are looking for a Data Analytics Business Partner to strengthen our knowledge around how to drive excellence in Operations.

While you will report directly to the Director of Analytics, you will be embedded in the Operational Leadership team for our Cluster North European markets.

Provide deep analytical insights to inform timely Cluster North European Operations leadership team decisions - either proactively, on a regular cadence (QBRs, MBRs), or through ad hoc projects
Generate new ideas for how to leverage the data we have to drive operational excellence in our Cluster North European markets
Opportunity size and prioritise analytics ideas and questions in our Cluster North European markets, with the support of your Vice President of Operations
Proactively bring relevant & actionable insights from the rest of the Analytics team (embedded in other areas of the organisation) to the Cluster North European Operations leadership team;
Elevate the data literacy across the Cluster North European Operational leadership team
Identify, advocate, and build opportunities for scale and automation across the team
Elevate our Global Analytics specialisation by sharing best practices and learnings and offering ad-hoc guidance to other team members on their projects


Requirements


You demonstrate business acumen through significant experience in an analytical role supporting 2 or more of the following functions: Sales, Marketing, Operations, Finance, Strategy, Business Operations, Leadership; or relevant work experience in Consulting
You are proficient in SQL, comfortable with Python or R, and proficient in manipulating data efficiently for ad-hoc analysis
You are experienced with Data Visualization tools like Looker, Tableau, PowerBI or similar
You are focused on business outcomes by framing insights in a way that inspires action
You are comfortable describing statistical uncertainty and educating non-technical audiences on how best to interpret and action off of new insights
You have proven experience in stakeholder management, with the ability to manage a high influx of requests in a structured way
You are driven by the “why” behind the work that you do, always eager to ask an extra question to make sure you’re solving for the right thing
You have a proactive mindset and work well in a team environment
You have the ability to communicate effectively and convincingly in an English-speaking organisation
Previous experience in a hyper growth start-up environment will be valued


Our values


We win together: Food waste is a big beast to fight. We believe in a #oneteam.

Keep reading; we are looking for a Quantitative Analyst to join our newly established Macro Trading team.







In Macro Trading, we combine macroeconomic insights and data analysis with market-specific knowledge of power, gas, and emissions to generate trading decisions. The macro portfolio is like a start-up with a high degree of autonomy and the opportunity to explore new ideas to innovate and rethink European Energy Trading, while having the backing of a larger and mature organization, increasing the probability of success.




As a Quantitative Analyst, you will be key in building our quantitative macroeconomic framework. Additionally, you will collaborate closely with traders, quants, and other analysts to develop quantifiable and actionable analysis.




Your journey as a Quantitative Analyst

We seek a highly analytical and detail-oriented Quantitative Analyst with a dedicated focus on macroeconomics and econometrics to support our energy trading activities. In this role, you will leverage macroeconomic data—such as interest rates, inflation, and growth - and advanced econometric techniques to create proprietary models that forecast market prices and support our trading strategies.




The ideal candidate will have a deep understanding of the global macroeconomic landscape and how it influences commodity prices, energy supply, and demand, paired with exceptional skills in econometric modeling and quantitative research.




We will ensure you are ready to take on your new role by giving you the best possible introduction to the team, our business, and our organization. You will be introduced to our macroeconomic framework, and any potential knowledge gaps will be addressed to maximize your success.




At InCommodities, we do not believe in bureaucracy, stringent processes, or micro-management. Instead, we grant you high autonomy, which we believe unlocks greater engagement and ensures that the best decisions are made – always by those closest to the job.'




Key Responsibilities

Develop and implement econometric models that predict key macroeconomic variables
Incorporate macroeconomic factors to predict energy prices and supply-demand dynamics
Collaborate with traders and quants to translate macroeconomic data and econometric insights into actionable trading strategies.
Continuously monitor and refine models to reflect changes in the macroeconomic environment




Qualifications – we imagine that you:

Hold a master’s degree or PhD in Economics, Finance, or a similar field with a focus on econometrics
Have experience with time-series analysis, forecasting, and other advanced econometric techniques
Possess excellent coding skills (Python is an advantage)
Preferably have knowledge of energy markets (oil, natural gas, electricity)
Have great communication skills enabling you to present complex macroeconomic insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders




Personal skills – we expect that you:

Are super passionate and knowledgeable about econometrics
Actively follow and understand what is happening in the world of macroeconomics
Have a curious and competitive mindset
Can be direct with your colleagues in a constructive way
Can work independently with a strong drive towards achieving results
Are a team player who will do what is best for the team and InCommodities




What you can expect from us:

You will join a team of experienced colleagues and will have the opportunity to work closely together with quants, analysts, and traders to build a macro trading desk
We will provide you with opportunities to develop both professionally and personally
We will provide you with flexibility and autonomy to drive real impact
You will be part a unique company culture where we live up to our values: Honesty, Transparency, and Rethink and where you don't have to abide by a dress code or a strict hierarchy, so you won't be frustrated with too many rules, policies, or bureaucratic processes.

40% of all food produced in the world is wasted. And that has a huge impact on the health of our planet, with 10% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from food waste.

We’re more than an app: we are a certified BCorp with a mission to empower everyone to take action against food waste, so alongside our marketplace app, we create educational tools, explore new business solutions - such as our Retail Tech offering, and influence legislation to help reduce food waste.

We’re growing fast: Our community of 116 million registered users and 243,000 active partners across 19 countries, have together already prevented 431+million meals from going to waste - avoiding over 1.165.000 tonnes of CO2e!

This role can be based either in Copenhagen or London.

Your mission

We are looking for a Data Analytics Business Partner to strengthen our knowledge around how to drive excellence in Operations.

While you will report directly to the Director of Analytics, you will work closely with our Strategy & Expansion teams, as well as members of the Global Management Team. Your mission will be to work as a trusted advisor to leadership in driving key strategic decisions, mapping strategy to data-driven ways of working, and championing scaled analysis across our Cluster Business Partnering team. You will be 1 of 6 Business Partners: while the others are dedicated to an Operational Leadership team in regional markets, you’ll be working on connecting the dots at the global level. The Business Partnering team works closely together to share cross-country insights in an efficient and scalable way.

Your role


Provide deep analytical insights to inform timely Sales, Strategy and Leadership decisions - either proactively, on a regular cadence (QBRs, MBRs), or through ad hoc projects
Mobilize the Cluster Business Partners to bring relevant & actionable insights from the rest of the Data & Analytics team to the Regional Operations leadership teams
Utilize the deep in-market expertise of the Cluster Business Partner team to proactively identify and build opportunities for scale and automation; prioritize and advocate for further scale via data products with our Solutions team
Elevate our Global Analytics specialisation by sharing best practices and learnings and offering ad-hoc guidance to other team members on their projects
Opportunity size and prioritise analytics ideas and questions from common themes across our markets and clusters, with the support of the COO, the Strategy team, and Operations VPs in our Expansion Markets


Requirements


You have significant experience in an analytical role supporting 2 or more of the following functions: Sales, Marketing, Operations, Finance, Strategy, Business Operations; or relevant work experience in Consulting
You are proficient in SQL, comfortable with Python or R, and proficient in manipulating data efficiently for ad-hoc analysis
You are experienced with Data Visualization tools like Looker, Tableau, PowerBI or similar
You are comfortable describing statistical uncertainty and educating non-technical audiences on how best to interpret and action off of new insights
You have proven experience in stakeholder management, with the ability to manage a high influx of requests in a structured way
You are driven by the “why” behind the work that you do, always eager to ask an extra question to make sure you’re solving for the right thing
You have a proactive mindset and work well in a team environment
You have the ability to communicate effectively and convincingly in an English-speaking organisation
Previous experience in a hyper growth start-up environment will be valued


Our values


We win together: Food waste is a big beast to fight. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: We always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: Our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple.
We build a legacy: We’re proud of the change we’re driving.
We care: We always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.


What We Have To Offer


A rare opportunity to work in a social impact company (and certified B Corporation!) where you get to wake up every day knowing you’re achieving positive change.
The opportunity to truly drive impact within your domain towards a planet with no food waste.
The experience of being part of an international company with 1300 + enthusiastic and highly talented teammates across 19 countries (and counting) – always ready to share knowledge and support!
Strong personal as well as professional development in an intense and high-growth scale-up environment.
An open company culture where you have the independence and room to unleash your creativity.
A strong team culture where successes are celebrated together.
We work in a hybrid set-up and value in office work weekly.

Som Data Engineer hos cVation bygger du dataplatforme, datawarehouses og MLOps løsninger i skyen for vores kunder. Vi bruger teknologier som Databricks, Fabric, Spark, Azure Machine Learning, Data Factory og Azure Synapse. Vi søger profiler med erfaring inden for enten MLOps, datawarehouses eller dataplatforme, som vil bygge innovative dataløsninger.




cVation er et dansk udviklings- og konsulenthus, som bygger avancerede cloudløsninger på Azure med afsæt i markedets hurtigste og mest agile metoder. cVation blev stiftet i 2014, har modtaget tre Børsen Gazeller og vundet Microsofts Partner Award for App Innovation tre år i træk. Vi arbejder dedikeret med agile arbejdsmetoder, DevOps og Test Driven Development. Vi sætter en ære i at levere software af den højeste kvalitet, og tager desuden principperne fra DevOps og software engineering med i vores dataprojekter, hvilket betyder, at tests, Infrastructure as Code og automatisering er i fokus.




Hvilken rolle får du?




Du kommer til at arbejde på et af vores dataprojekter med et projektteam bestående af arkitekter, software udviklere og DevOps specialister. Du vil have fuldt fokus på ét projekt og være tilknyttet ét team ad gangen.




Din rolle bliver at




rådgive om og bygge datawarehouse/dataplatformsløsninger i skyen
rådgive om og bygge løsninger indenfor MLOps
bidrage til design og implementering af den optimale Azure infrastruktur
sikre, at alt opsætning og provisionering sker som infrastructure as code, fx. Terraform
fuldautomatiseret overvågning og skalering af løsninger




Hvad forventer vi af dig?




Du har en videregående uddannelse i software engineering, human centered AI el lign. fra DTU, ITU eller KU samt erfaring i data engineering
Du har enten fullstack MLOps erfaring, kan skrive Python og har lyst til data engineering-delen - eller måske kommer du i stedet med erfaring i at bygge datawarehouse og dataplatforme.
Du vil gerne arbejde med de nyeste teknologier i Azure
Du har erfaring med - og vil gerne blive klogere på - flere af følgende teknologier: Data Factory - Databricks - Fabric - Spark - Azure Synapse - Azure Machine Learning - MLflow - Data Warehouse - Data platform - Python - Azure DevOps, Powershell, Azure CLI, ARM templates, YAML, Bicep, Terraform, Git
Du vil gerne indgå i et agilt setup, hvor krav og retning hurtigt kan ændres, men hvor medbestemmelse og frihed er i højsædet
Du er flydende i skrift og tale på dansk og engelsk, og trives med at have den daglige kontakt med kunden
Du har evnen til at omsætte kundebehov til handling




Det vil være en fordel, hvis:

Du er vant til at arbejde som konsulent i et udviklingsteam i tæt samarbejde med arkitekter og software udviklere




Som person er du selvstændig, ansvarsbevidst, initiativrig, eksekverende og serviceminded. Du er drevet af at lære nyt og vild med at holde dig ajour med de nyeste metoder og teknologier. Du er engageret og motiveret i alt hvad du foretager dig. Hvis du også er glad for at sparre med dygtige kollegaer og trives med at løfte i flok, vil du passe perfekt ind hos os.




Hvad tilbyder vi?




Du kommer til at indgå i vores voksende team, hvor høj faglighed, innovation og arbejdsglæde er i højsæde. Det høje faglige niveau blandt dine kollegaer giver en unik mulighed for at arbejde med de bedste, og vi tager din faglige udvikling alvorligt. Vi har en flad organisation med et minimum af administration, hvor ledelsens døre altid er åbne, og der er god plads til både bordfodbold, fredagsbar, frokost på kajen og et aktivt liv udenfor arbejdstid. Flere gange om året afholder vi hackathons, hvor vi i teams dykker ned i præcis de emner, som udviklerne finder interessante. En del af vores kultur er også, at vi gerne ser alle komme med input til hvordan vi kan optimere, udvikle og forbedre cVation.




Hvorfor vælge os som din nye arbejdsplads?




Vores fundament er løsninger bygget på Microsoft Azure Cloud. Alle vores medarbejdere mestrer cloud-native udvikling og DevOps. Vi arbejder i projekter og engagerer os hands-on i fælles teams med vores kunder for at sikre kvalitet og effektiv videndeling.




Vi er passionerede omkring at hjælpe vores kunder med at få det maksimale ud af cloudteknologien. For os er cloud ikke blot infrastruktur eller et nyt datacenter i skyen. Teknologien giver virksomheder mulighed for at skabe væsentligt mere værdi og arbejde med agilitet og innovation på en helt ny måde.




Vi har været med fra starten, da cloud blev udviklet og tilgængeligt. Vi tilbyder således vores årelange erfaring og dybe cloud ekspertise samt en værktøjskasse med alle vores best practices i form af accelerationsplatformen CADD. Den dækker over gennemprøvede værktøjer, rammeværk, effektive udviklingsmetoder og færdige automatiseringskomponenter. Alt dette for at sikre, at projekter kommer hurtigt og sikkert fra start.




Du vil blive en del af en virksomhed, som tror på, at alle har betydning, og at det skal være sjovt at gå på arbejde hver dag. Du vil få kollegaer, der er interesseret i at lære og har ønske om at blive de bedste til det, de gør. Vi tilbyder derfor gode muligheder for at udvikle dig.




Interesseret?




Klik på Easy Apply knappen, hvis du vil arbejde med de nyeste teknologier. Vi behandler din ansøgning fortroligt og arrangerer løbende interviews.




Har du spørgsmål til jobbet, eller vil du høre mere om cVation, er du meget velkommen til at kontakte:

If so, global change communications might be for you. We’re on the lookout for candidates who are interested in the world around them and are passionate about tackling global issues. At M+C Saatchi World Services we are focused on tackling some of humanity’s most challenging and important problems, in fragile states and developing countries, harnessing the power of cutting-edge communications and creativity to achieve long-term behaviour change.

ABOUT THE ROLE

This role offers a unique opportunity to combine collaboration and learning. 

You'll work closely with a senior data scientist, gaining mentorship, guidance, and feedback on your data analysis projects. 
By actively participating in team meetings and project discussions, you'll contribute fresh perspectives and innovative ideas. 
To further develop your technical skillset, you'll undergo comprehensive training in data analysis tools and techniques, including SQL, and dashboarding. 
Finally, you'll master the art of data storytelling, preparing and presenting project reports that effectively communicate findings, methodologies, and results to both technical and non-technical audiences, ultimately impacting company decision-making.
You will be paid London Living Wage.

ABOUT YOU

We are looking for candidates who have:

Curious minds: We want someone who is naturally curious and fascinated by the world and why it is the way it is, particularly from a geo-political perspective. Someone who stops scrolling to read about what’s going on around the world and invests themselves in social issues. Someone who has a belief in the idea that communications, when applied properly, can lead to a better world.
A knack for collaborating: We work jointly with partners and agencies as well as other M&C Saatchi companies to provide support from strategy to implementation for many of our campaigns. We need a natural collaborator. Someone who empowers those around them and is open, willing and able to engage new people inside and outside of our organisation.
A desire for a meaningful career: What gets you out of bed in the morning? Those who are driven by a greater purpose and search for a ‘why’ in what they do will often find commercial careers unfulfilling. We are searching for the people who want their career to mean something.
Technical experience and programmatic ability: Candidates are expected to have the requisite skills to work within a data team. Knowledge of Python is essential, SQL desirable, and wider technical skills are welcomed. Familiarity with version control systems, especially Git, is strongly desirable. Candidates should be comfortable processing, understanding, and drawing insights from large datasets.

As we value curiosity and collaboration, we are looking for individuals who are naturally fascinated by the world and why it is the way it is, particularly from a data-driven perspective. A belief in the power of data and communications to improve the world is a must.

East London (Hybrid - 3 days per week)
£40,000 - £55,000 DOE

We're working with a fast-moving, customer-focused telco brand looking to bring in two Data Analysts - one more junior, one more mid-level - to help drive insight across their commercial and customer landscape.

This is a great opportunity for someone with solid SQL skills who wants hands-on experience, meaningful projects, and genuine growth opportunities (with a clear path to promotion over the next 12-24 months). You'll be working closely with a hands-on Head of Analytics, senior stakeholders, and cross-functional teams across the business.

The Role

Handle ad-hoc data pulls and reporting requests

Take ownership of dashboarding (Power BI), and improve visualisation/reporting processes

Deep dive into customer data - churn analysis, CLV projects, marketing campaign performance

Collaborate with commercial, marketing, and country teams on strategic projects (e.g. handset launches, global campaign success)

Help improve data quality across the business and support wider insight efforts

Present findings to senior stakeholders, including finance and country managers

What They're Looking For

SQL is essential - window functions, joins, aggregations for the mid-level role

Strong business acumen and commercial thinking

Experience in customer/marketing analytics or a real desire to develop in that space

Bonus: Power BI, Python, exposure to presenting insights to non-technical audiences

Personality and mindset matter - curiosity, drive, and a collaborative approach are key

Salary

Junior Analyst: £40,000-£45,000

Mid-Level Analyst: Up to £55,000

Interview Process

Stage 1: Informal 30-min Teams chat with the Head of Analytics

Stage 2: Presentation round + Q&A with the team

Optional sign-off with a senior stakeholder

This is an exciting chance to step into a role with visibility, variety, and loads of room to grow. Let us know if you'd like to hear more.

Our vision is to simplify and revolutionise the home moving and ownership experience for everyone. We are on a mission to deliver products and services that remove the pain, frustration, uncertainty, friction and stress that the current process creates.

We are a leading provider of tech in the property sector - founded in 2003, our product focus has been our conveyancer two-sided marketplace, connecting consumers with a range of quality conveyancers to choose from at competitive prices via our easy-to-use tech platform. We are now building out our ecosystem so consumers can benefit from our services either via their Estate Agent or their Mortgage Broker, through smarter conveyancing platforms, making the home buying or selling process easier, quicker, safer and more transparent

Why join Smoove?

Great question! We pride ourselves on attracting, developing and retaining a diverse range of people in an equally diverse range of roles and specialisms – who together achieve outstanding results. Our transparent approach and open-door policy make Smoove a great place to work and as our business expands, we are looking for ambitious, talented people to join us.

We are looking for a Data Engineer who is capable of maintaining and optimising our current data solution as well as advancing it to the next level. We have created an initial gem of a Data Lake and Lakehouse (Azure Data Lake, ADF, Databricks, Airflow, DBT) to enable Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (Superset, RStudio Connect). Our Data Lake is fully metadata driven, cost efficient, documented, and reproducible.

We need our one-source-of-truth to be reliable and of high quality for both internal and external reporting and insight generation. But it is just the start – we will need best practice solutions around how we share data and insight back to our partners in a scalable and maintainable way. We have big data plans and new products on their way, and we need you to think innovatively and design and implement fast and scalable, but also resilient customer facing solutions that will enable us to provide our customer with the best experience through insight and interaction.

Our source data lives in different systems (including SQL servers, Google Analytics and Salesforce). If you have experience setting up data pipelines and in-depth knowledge of Azure/ Databricks technologies, you are comfortable taking a lead, taking responsibility and you want to put your stamp on our evolving data solution, then this will be the job for you. We work in a fast-paced environment, and it is a priority to enable Analytics and Data Science with access to quality data and the right tools and technologies. But there is no stopping there – we will be a leader in the Proptech Data space, and we need you to drive innovation in your solutions as we grow.

Main responsibilities:


Take ownership of the centralisation of different data sources into our Lakehouse (Databricks on Azure Data Lake) and its architecture.
Be responsible for the reliability and quality of data in the Data Lake (including anomaly detection, data quality checks, reconciliations, access, permission, and retention management, PII treatment, and back-up/ restoration plans).
Set up and manage platform technologies to support Analytics/ Data Science enablement.
Be innovative and lead the data solution to meet our requirements now and in future.


Skills / Experience required:


(Required) 3+ years of relevant Data Engineering experience (Preferably Databricks/Azure - or Snowflake/Redshift/BigQuery)
(Required) Experience with infrastructure as code (e.g. Terraform)
(Required) Proficiency in using Python both for scheduling (e.g. Airflow) and manipulating data (PySpark)
(Required) Experience building deployment pipelines (e.g. Azure Pipelines)
(Required) Deployment of web apps using Kubernetes (Preferably ArgoCD & Helm)
(Preferred) Experience working on Analytics and Data Science enablement (dbt, DS deployments)
(Preferred) Experience in MDM, Data Cataloguing and Lineage optimisation
A strong preference for simplicity and transparency over complexity
Best practice and detail focussed to enable scalability in future

A leading professional services firm is looking for a hands-on Data Engineer to join them at a pivotal moment in their data journey. This is a unique opportunity to own and shape the development of a modern Azure-based data platform from the ground up — replacing legacy reporting tools, consolidating business-critical data sources, and paving the way for Microsoft Fabric adoption.




The organisation is mid-way through a modernisation programme. They’ve moved away from outdated SAP BO reports and started building a scalable data foundation using Azure Synapse, ADF, and Power BI, with support from a Microsoft partner. They are now looking for someone to take ownership of the platform and guide the business through the next phase of growth.




What You’ll Be Doing




Owning the end-to-end design and delivery of data pipelines using ADF and Synapse
Working with internal systems (finance, HR, case management) to extract, model, and prepare data for reporting
Collaborating closely with a small BI team, advising on how to shape clean, usable datasets for Power BI
Preparing for a move to Microsoft Fabric (training/support available)
Acting as a subject matter expert in data engineering, supporting and educating others along the way
