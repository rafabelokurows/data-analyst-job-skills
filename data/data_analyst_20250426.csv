About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Payment Intelligence Engineering’s purpose is to mitigate threats to our systems in order to keep our merchants, Stripe and financial partners safe. We empower global businesses with intelligent solutions for conversion and fraud prevention, leveraging consumer intelligence and transparent ML to maximize growth and build trust. Our Payments Intelligence portfolio delivers actionable insights to all user segments.

The Payments Health Technical Operations team is pioneering new ways to achieve this mission. Our dynamic team relies on the expertise of integration reliability engineers and data analysts to identify gaps and build comprehensive solutions in the ever changing arena of fraud prevention.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and maintain SQL queries to analyze and navigate complex financial data effectively.
Enhance overall observability by identifying gaps and proposing actionable insights to improve our monitoring systems.
Actively hunt for patterns and anomalies in data that could indicate potential threats or operational issues.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to consolidate and gather relevant data for informed engineering efforts.
Design and implement comprehensive dashboards for real-time visibility into key metrics and system health.
Establish and refine key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress and improvements over time.
Support the creation and maintenance of observability frameworks to ensure early detection of issues.
Contribute to efforts that reduce organizational toil by optimizing data analysis processes.
Communicate findings and insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Stay updated with industry trends in data analysis and financial data handling to ensure best practices.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have 5+ years of experience in Payments at a leading technology or payments company
Have experience writing SQL to query relational databases
Have experience managing communications and workflows with technical and non-technical teams across internal and external stakeholders
Experience mentoring junior team members in technical skill development, operational strategy and problem solving
Have experience navigating the nuanced complexity of financial systems and solving large scale, technical challenges
Have strong financial modeling and analytical skills to investigate, prioritize, and identify the root cause of issues
Have experience managing multiple, concurrent work streams, identifying and triaging technical issues and driving solutions with clear metrics to show impact



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,400 - $219,600. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

The salary range provided is based on transparent pay guidelines and is an estimate for candidates residing in the San Francisco Bay area.

Must be willing to work from our SF office at least 3x per week

This position requires a commitment to a hybrid work model, with the expectation of coming into the office a minimum of (3) three times per week. Relocation assistance is available for candidates willing to move to San Francisco.

We value people who are eager to learn new things and recognize that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.

Why work at Abridge?

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

How we take care of Abridgers:


Generous Time Off: 13 paid holidays, flexible PTO for salaried employees, and accrued time off for hourly employees.
Comprehensive Health Plans: Medical, Dental, and Vision plans for all full-time employees. Abridge covers 100% of the premium for you and 75% for dependents. If you choose a HSA-eligible plan, Abridge also makes monthly contributions to your HSA.
Paid Parental Leave: 16 weeks paid parental leave for all full-time employees.
401k and Matching: Contribution matching to help invest in your future.
Pre-tax Benefits: Access to Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) and Commuter Benefits.
Learning and Development Budget: Yearly contributions for coaching, courses, workshops, conferences, and more.
Sabbatical Leave: 30 days of paid Sabbatical Leave after 5 years of employment.
Compensation and Equity: Competitive compensation and equity grants for full time employees.
... and much more!


Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Payment Intelligence Engineering’s purpose is to mitigate threats to our systems in order to keep our merchants, Stripe and financial partners safe. We empower global businesses with intelligent solutions for conversion and fraud prevention, leveraging consumer intelligence and transparent ML to maximize growth and build trust. Our Payments Intelligence portfolio delivers actionable insights to all user segments.

The Payments Health Technical Operations team is pioneering new ways to achieve this mission. Our dynamic team relies on the expertise of integration reliability engineers and data analysts to identify gaps and build comprehensive solutions in the ever changing arena of fraud prevention.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and maintain SQL queries to analyze and navigate complex financial data effectively.
Enhance overall observability by identifying gaps and proposing actionable insights to improve our monitoring systems.
Actively hunt for patterns and anomalies in data that could indicate potential threats or operational issues.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to consolidate and gather relevant data for informed engineering efforts.
Design and implement comprehensive dashboards for real-time visibility into key metrics and system health.
Establish and refine key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress and improvements over time.
Support the creation and maintenance of observability frameworks to ensure early detection of issues.
Contribute to efforts that reduce organizational toil by optimizing data analysis processes.
Communicate findings and insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Stay updated with industry trends in data analysis and financial data handling to ensure best practices.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have 5+ years of experience in Payments at a leading technology or payments company
Have experience writing SQL to query relational databases
Have experience managing communications and workflows with technical and non-technical teams across internal and external stakeholders
Experience mentoring junior team members in technical skill development, operational strategy and problem solving
Have experience navigating the nuanced complexity of financial systems and solving large scale, technical challenges
Have strong financial modeling and analytical skills to investigate, prioritize, and identify the root cause of issues
Have experience managing multiple, concurrent work streams, identifying and triaging technical issues and driving solutions with clear metrics to show impact



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,400 - $219,600. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Want to make an impact? Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.




We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.




Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, we work closely with our teams in Barcelona, San Antonio, Spokane, and remote locations. We’ve got a reputation for being a great place to work, having been named among the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Seattle Business Magazine and Washington’s Best Workplaces in the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies.




At Rover, our furry coworkers are just as important as our human ones—and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Along with making the joys of pet parenthood more accessible, we’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community of pet people—and that starts with our employees.




Who we're looking for:

The Marketing Analytics team supports the company’s marketing efforts, while also working with teams throughout the organization. The analytics team is responsible for a number of business-critical reports and data models that our global marketing teams rely on for daily reporting, budgeting, and analysis. We measure marketing attribution to understand how people become Rover customers, provide campaign reporting to monitor trends in cost efficiency and optimization, deliver lifecycle data to action against a variety of customer behaviors, and narrate the business to identify and prioritize new opportunities.




We are looking for an Analyst to support our Growth, International Expansion, Lifecycle, and SEO stakeholders with a focus on improving our reporting and dashboard structure. The ideal candidate will have experience working closely with business stakeholders and building data-driven narratives that enable clear decision making.




Your Responsibilities:

Work closely with analytics peers and marketing teams to narrate trends and insights, with a particular focus on our customer acquisition marketing programs.
Design reports and dashboards that enable clear, data-driven decision-making for marketing and cross-functional teams.
Refine our marketing attribution models to drive optimal resource allocation across paid and organic marketing channels.
Expand your expertise by supporting experiments such as A/B testing and Market Match tests to optimize strategies across multiple marketing functions.




Your Qualifications:

At least 2 years experience working with complex datasets to support business decision making.
Fluency in SQL.
Data visualisation tool experience (e.g. Mode, Looker, Tableau, etc.)
Ability to adapt your communication style to translate complex data insights for different audiences.
You have experience in owning small-to-medium projects from design to completion with limited guidance from your manager.
You understand when you are blocked, proactively seeking out for help within the team or the organization to move the project forward.




Nice to Have:

Python or R familiarity is helpful, but we welcome candidates eager to develop these skills.
Experience evaluating results of A/B tests as well as expertise in statistical analysis.
Understanding of marketing metrics such as clicks, CPC, CTR, impressions, and unit economics like customer LTV, payback period, and CAC.




Benefits of working at Rover:

Competitive compensation
Long-term incentive plan with a company performance-based cash payout
Permanent contract
Pension Plan
Meal tickets through Cobee
Generous PTO Allowance
Hybrid schedule
Private health insurance
Discounted Gym Membership
Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time)
Monetary help for adopting a dog plus yearly credit to use on our platform
Flexible work hours, sometimes you’ll need to be in at certain times, but on the whole, we’re pretty flexible when it comes to managing workload and time
Grab snacks, fresh fruit, in our kitchen to keep yourself going
Regular team activities, including happy hours, game nights, and more

Data Analyst (Marketplace, Seller Experience Team)

The Data Analyst – Seller Experience will play a central role in driving data-informed decisions across the entire Seller Experience division at eMAG. This role goes beyond a traditional reporting function; it is a strategic partner embedded directly in the product and experience organization. The analyst will support multiple verticals including seller onboarding, acquisition channels, performance monitoring, funnel optimization, UI/UX governance, and A/B testing initiatives.

Working closely with product managers, UX, content, comms, and seller support teams, the analyst will be responsible for creating and maintaining dashboards, conducting deep-dive analyses, and helping define KPIs that drive product prioritization and continuous improvement. This includes support across both web and mobile surfaces, as well as strategic initiatives like rating systems, personalization frameworks, and educational tools for sellers.

The role requires a balance of strong technical skills (SQL, data visualization, experimentation methods) and a good understanding of product dynamics. The analyst is expected to translate large volumes of raw data into insights that are easy to understand, actionable, and aligned with the annual OKRs of the division, reviewed monthly.




What You’ll Have To Do

Partner with Product Managers, UX Designers, and other stakeholders to define, monitor, and evolve product KPIs across all seller-facing surfaces (e.g., dashboard, mobile app, onboarding flows, CRM).
Design and maintain self-service dashboards that support day-to-day decision-making across the Seller Experience division.
Analyze behavioral data to uncover insights on seller engagement, feature adoption, friction points, and drop-off across funnels.
Build tracking plans and collaborate with developers to ensure consistent and reliable event instrumentation across platforms.
Own the end-to-end analysis lifecycle for major initiatives: define the hypothesis, pull and validate the data, analyze trends, and present actionable recommendations.
Conduct A/B test analysis to validate the impact of new features or experience changes, ensuring statistical rigor and clear communication of results.
Identify data quality issues, propose solutions, and work with engineering or data teams to address inconsistencies or gaps.
Provide ongoing support to quarterly OKRs and monthly performance reviews by delivering insights that shape prioritization and roadmap adjustments.
Contribute to the creation of a shared understanding of seller behavior across teams by building consistent reporting layers and documentation.
Continuously seek opportunities to improve how data is captured, structured, visualized, and used in decision-making across the division.




What makes you a good fit:

Experience And Background

3+ years of experience in a Data Analyst or Product Analyst role, preferably in a digital product or eCommerce environment.
Proven ability to work with product and cross-functional teams to generate actionable insights that drive measurable outcomes.
Experience supporting product discovery, feature rollout, and UX iteration cycles through structured analysis.

Technical Skills

Strong proficiency in SQL (e.g., BigQuery, PostgreSQL, or similar) for data extraction, transformation, and performance analysis.
Experience building and maintaining dashboards in BI tools such as Looker, Tableau, Power BI, or similar.
Familiarity with product analytics tools like Amplitude, Mixpanel, or Google Analytics for behavior tracking and funnel analysis.
Ability to design and interpret A/B tests; understanding of statistical significance, test design, and experimentation platforms.
Experience working with large datasets, joining across multiple sources (e.g., CRM, product logs, feedback platforms).
Comfortable working with data in Google Sheets, Excel, or Python (optional but a plus).

Analytical Thinking and Business Context

Ability to transform vague questions into structured analysis plans, and raw data into clear business narratives.
Solid understanding of metrics frameworks: DAU, MAU, conversion rates, retention curves, NPS, engagement ratios, etc.
Experience defining KPIs and building metric hierarchies for product dashboards, funnels, or seller engagement.
High attention to detail when validating data quality or interpreting trends.
Understanding of marketplace dynamics and multi-stakeholder ecosystems is a strong plus.

Communication and Collaboration

Able to communicate complex data findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
Experience working alongside Product Managers, UX Designers, and Content/Support teams to iterate on solutions.
Strong documentation skills: analysis notes, dashboards, tracking plans, etc.
Proactive and self-driven: able to push analysis forward even when requirements are not fully defined.

What Makes You Stand Out

Familiarity with experimentation platforms (e.g., Optimizely, Google Optimize, or in-house testing tools).
Prior experience supporting B2B platforms or seller/vendor interfaces.
Understanding of UI/UX data modeling or behavioral analytics.
Exposure to Python or dbt for data modeling is a plus.

Growth Opportunities

This role offers the opportunity to grow as a strategic analytical partner across one of eMAG’s most dynamic product areas. As the Seller Experience division continues to evolve, the Data Analyst will be well-positioned to deepen their impact and accelerate their career growth through:

Domain Ownership: Ability to progressively own specific verticals (e.g., onboarding, mobile seller app, performance tools) and become the go-to expert for data-driven decisions in that space.
Strategic Influence: Increased participation in quarterly planning, OKR setting, and roadmap validation by shaping how data is used to assess opportunity, risk, and performance.
Methodological Depth: Development in areas such as experimentation design, segmentation models, retention analysis, or funnel diagnostics—based on business needs and personal interest.
Cross-Divisional Exposure: Opportunities to support or collaborate with teams outside Seller Experience, such as Platform, Fulfillment, or Buyer Experience, depending on project scope.
Path to Seniority: Clear growth path toward a Senior Data Analyst role or hybrid Product-Data role, depending on profile and performance.
Professional Development: Access to training resources, cross-team learning, and potential mentorship by senior analysts in the centralized Data & AI function.

This role is ideal for a data-driven professional who thrives in fast-paced, product-focused environments and wants to make a real impact on how sellers interact with one of the largest eCommerce platforms in the region. The Data Analyst – Seller Experience will work at the intersection of user behavior, product strategy, and performance optimization, turning complex data into simple, actionable insights.

We value structured thinking, proactive collaboration, and a strong sense of ownership. You’ll be part of a team where your input will directly shape what gets built, how it's measured, and how success is defined across multiple product surfaces. You’ll work closely with a diverse mix of product managers, designers, and content teams, and be supported by modern tools and a growing analytics culture.

If you're looking for a role where you can influence both the what and the why of product decisions—while continuously sharpening your analytical and business skills—this is the place to grow.

Vous avez la capacité à transformer un océan de chiffres en informations stratégiques précieuses pour l’entreprise ? À l’aise avec les statistiques et les bases de données, vous décelez les tendances et les comportements clients ? Vous aimez analyser et visualiser des données complexes ? Ce métier vous place au cœur des décisions stratégiques avec une analyse précise des données récoltées.

Parce que chaque donnée compte pour optimiser sa stratégie, Arte France Développement, filiale d’Arte France, recrute un data analyst pour soutenir la croissance de l’activité Vidéo à la Demande (VOD) liée à la plateforme Arte Boutique et à la distribution des contenus de son catalogue auprès des plateformes partenaires.




Vous aurez comme mission :




Analyse Data :

Analyser des ensembles de données pour identifier les tendances et les modèles pertinents pour nourrir notre dynamique de croissance
Effectuer des analyses statistiques pour valider des résultats
Proposer des recommandations basées sur les résultats d’analyse
Elaborer des rapports et des tableaux de bord pour communiquer les résultats aux équipes
Assurer la qualité des données en réalisant des vérifications régulières

Veille technologique et suivi de l’activité :

Faire de la veille technologique des nouveaux outils visant à l’améliorer l’analyse des données
Mettre en œuvre et exploiter des technologies pour automatiser la collecte et l’analyse de données
Concevoir et exécuter des expériences pour tester des hypothèses

Coordination :

Travailler en étroite collaboration avec les équipes marketing, commercial et éditorial pour identifier leurs besoins et répondre à leurs questions stratégiques




Profil recherché




Parce que le rôle de Data Analyst est clé dans notre développement, nous recherchons les compétences suivantes :

compréhension approfondie des concepts statistiques et des méthodes d’analyse
capacité à communiquer efficacement des résultats à des non-spécialistes
compétences en visualisation des données
maîtrise des outils d’analyse de données, tels que SQL, R ou Python
aptitude à résoudre des problèmes complexes en utilisant des données
attention aux détails pour garantir l’exactitude des analyses
compétences en gestion de projet pour gérer des échéances et des priorités
capacité à travailler de manière autonome et en équipe




Parce qu’on aime bien les petits plus :

Le cinéma, les documentaires et les séries, ça vous parle ? Parce que vous allez baigner dedans. Autant vous préparer à disserter sur le dernier Ozon ou à imaginer « En thérapie » Saison 3 entre deux régressions statistiques
Do you speak english ? On aime bien aussi la langue de Shakespeare ou de Christopher Nolan, surtout qu’elle peut être très utile pour le poste
Comme on est déjà équipé, la connaissance d’Amplitude vous donnera un petit avantage, mais une customer data platform reste une customer data platform
Questions cursus : master en marketing, master en big data, master en mathématiques ou spécialisation en statistiques nous paraissent un bon début. Si vous avez en plus 3 ans d’expérience minimum dans un poste similaire




Si vous vous reconnaissez dans cette description ? On a très envie de vous rencontrer.




Le groupe ARTE est convaincu que la pluralité des talents et des parcours est une force et s’engage en faveur de la diversité et de l’inclusion.

Pearl Health is powering the future of healthcare. We help primary care providers and organizations to deliver quality healthcare to the patients who need it most, when they need it most — and get rewarded for keeping patients healthy.

Our technology, services, and financial tools enable better, more proactive care, decrease total cost of care across patient panels, and optimize performance in value-based care models for Traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage.

We are a team of physicians and public health experts (Stanford, Harvard, Mount Sinai), technologists (athenahealth, Amazon, Meta, Flatiron), healthcare innovators (Centivo, Aledade, Stellar, Arcadia), and experienced risk management professionals (CVS/Aetna, Humana, Oscar) who believe that primary care providers are the key to addressing our healthcare system’s biggest challenges.

Since its founding in 2020, Pearl has expanded to partner with thousands of primary care providers in practices and organizations across 44 states. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Viking Global Investors, AlleyCorp, and SV Angel.

Manage ambiguity while working with cross-functional teams on complex projects, with a focus on defining data requirements, developing analytical models, and interpreting results.
Partner with Data Engineering and Product to create end-to-end data pipelines that turn raw data into actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.
Contribute to the development of the data analytics roadmap and strategy by collaborating with leadership in the Data Science and Analytics organization to identify opportunities and propose technical and business-level solutions with a medium-term (1-2 year) time horizon.
Evaluate new data technologies and tools (including data warehouses, orchestration systems, and BI tools) to enhance the team's capabilities.
Mentor other data analysts, providing guidance on analytical techniques and best practices.
Help your manager establish standards, design guidelines, and SOPs for analytical workflows, e.g., dashboard development, EDA, and ingestion of new datasets.
