Als Data Analyst für Healthcare Analytics bist du Teil von Beratungsteams bei Klienten sowie von internen Projekten, Recherchen und Analysen zu Unternehmen und Trends in den europäischen Gesundheitssystemen. Wir sind Teil von McKinseys globalem Client Capability Network (client capability network) mit mehr als 7.000 Kolleginnen und Kollegen, die unsere Klienten und Beratungsteams mit Expertise und Branchenanalysen unterstützen. Zur Verstärkung unseres Teams in Deutschland suchen wir dich zum nächstmöglichen Zeitpunkt als Data Analyst für Healthcare Analytics.

Das Healthcare Analytics Team nutzt Analysen und Daten aus dem Gesundheitswesen (z.B. Krankenversicherungen oder Gesundheitseinrichtungen), um einige der dringendsten Herausforderungen unserer Klienten zu beantworten, wie zum Beispiel „Wie können wir die Kosten der Gesundheitsversorgung optimieren und gleichzeitig die Qualität verbessern?“, „Wie können wir mit KI/ML Prozesse optimieren und bspw. Rechnungsbetrug automatisiert erkennen?“, „Wer sind die sensibelsten Patientengruppen und mit welchen Behandlungspfaden können wir ihre Versorgung verbessern?“

Healthcare Analytics ist ein Team innerhalb der SHaPE-Practice (Social, Healthcare and Public Entities) mit Fokus auf der spezialisierten Beratung von Einrichtungen des Gesundheitswesens, insbesondere Kostenträgern. Unser Ziel ist es, mit der Unterstützung von Advanced Analytics, KI sowie unseren standardisierten Methoden für Diagnostik, Optimierung und Implementierung für unsere Klienten positive und nachhaltige Veränderung zu erzielen.

Your Impact

In der Rolle als Data Analyst in Healthcare Analytics unterstützt du unsere Beratungsteams mit quantitativen Analysen sowie KI/ML-Ansätzen und entwickelst unser Portfolio an datengetriebenen Lösungen und innovativen Lösungsansätzen kontinuierlich weiter.

Du wirst eng mit unseren Klienten aus verschiedenen Bereichen wie Krankenversicherungen, Leistungserbringern oder Private Equity zusammenarbeiten und dabei deine Fähigkeiten im Projektmanagement und in der Kommunikation mit diversen Stakeholdern einsetzen.

Im Healthcare Analytics Team handeln wir unternehmerisch. Daher suchen wir jemanden mit der Motivation, kontinuierlich den Status Quo zu verbessern und dies auch eigenständig voranzutreiben.

Als Data Analyst wird von dir erwartet, dass du Erfahrung im Umgang mit großen Datensätzen, insbesondere in der Analyse und Modellierung, mitbringst.

Deine täglichen Aufgaben umfassen die Analyse und Modellierung großer Datensätze sowie die enge Zusammenarbeit mit unseren Data Engineers beim Aufbau und der Pflege unserer McKinsey Big Data Plattform. Du wirst Dashboards und ML/KI-Modelle entwickeln, wobei du sowohl Low-Code/No-Code-Tools als auch Python und Visualisierungstools nutzen kannst. Im täglichen Geschäft arbeitest du eng mit unseren Data Engineering Kollegen, dem Capabilities and Insights Team sowie unseren Beratungsteams zusammen, um die Kundenarbeit vorzubereiten und durchzuführen.

Getreu unserem Motto – People is what makes us us – sind uns deine nachhaltige Ausbildung und Weiterentwicklung, deine ausgeglichene Work-Life-Balance und deine Happiness sehr wichtig. Konkret stellen wir mit 32 Urlaubstagen, 60 % mobilem Arbeiten, bis zu 4 Wochen pro Jahr – im europäischen Ausland – der Möglichkeit remote zu arbeiten, Sabbatical und Überstundenausgleich sicher, dass dir im FUSE-Agentur-Leben nichts fehlt.

In unserem derzeit über 60-köpfigen Team sowie unseren Kund*innen haben wir unser perfektes Match bereits gefunden. Wenn du noch auf der Suche bist, bei „popkulturellem Relevanzmarketing“ neugierig wirst und für Social Media, Influencer Marketing oder Gaming & Esports brennst, dann lass uns zusammen loslegen! Denn : Action Creates Impact .

Dein Job

Als (Junior) Insights Analyst (mensch) bearbeitest du als Teil unseres Data und Analytics Teams in erster Linie die Anfragen unserer Kunden nach Social Media Reportings sowie Social Listening Analysen und beherrschst den Spagat zwischen analytischem und kreativem Denken, um die Kolleg:Innen in deinem und anderen Teams mit datenbasierten Insights zu Kundenmeinungen, Märkten, Zielgruppen, Marken und ihren Social Media-Umfeldern zu versorgen.

Dein Aufgabenbereich

Datenbeschaffung / Toolbedienung

Du bist präzise, schnell, zuverlässig und motiviert, wenn es um die manuelle Erfassung großer (Social Media)- Datenmengen geht, aber auch wissbegierig und begeisterungsfähig, dich diesbezüglich kontinuierlich mit Prozessoptimierung zu befassen, sowie dich in Tools und automatisierte Datenerfassungsprozesse und Methoden einzudenken, um immer bessere Lösungen zu finden.

Datenstrukturierung, Effiziente Datensammlung, Query Writing, Kategorisierung und Datendarstellung werden hier deine täglichen Begleiter.

Studiendurchführung

Von der (manchmal noch recht schwammigen) Fragestellung bis zum fertigen Analysebericht mit guten Insights und Handlungsempfehlungen ist es oft ein weiter aber spannender Weg. Der kann bald auch deiner sein, gemeinsam mit uns im Team.

Du hast ein sehr gutes Gespür für Sprache und Kommunikation? Nice, das brauchst du hier in mindestens dreierlei Hinsicht: Erstens, um aus den Aussagen und Briefings unserer Auftraggeber herausfiltern zu können, wie du ihnen am besten weiterhelfen kannst. Zweitens, wenn es darum geht, die Essenz von Konsumenten-Posts und Kommentaren auf Social Media zu verstehen, schließlich ist Inhaltanalyse unser Daily-Business. Und Drittens, um dann Deine Findings Zielgruppengerecht rüberzubringen - in Reports, in Meetings und bei Präsentationen.

Datenanalyse

Auswertungslogiken passend zu den gegebenen Fragestellungen und Erkenntnisinteressen erstellen, Dimensionierungen & Kategorisierungen für Inhaltsanalysen planen und entwickeln, Daten auszählen, filtern, darstellen, vergleichen, interpretieren, daraus kreative Idee und Empfehlungen ableiten. Das ist dein Playground. Deine Affinität zu Zahlen und Daten kannst du hier immer wieder beweisen. Ein stets strukturiertes Vorgehen und ein souveräner Umgang auch mit großen und komplexen Datenmengen, Statistiken und Zahlen sind für dich selbstverständlich.

Spezielle Social Media Analyse-Tools wirst Du ebenso (kennenlernen und) zum Einsatz bringen wie ganz viel Excel und das gute alte Powerpoint.

Das bringst du mit

Du kannst (erste) Erfahrung in der qualitativen und quantitativen Forschungsarbeit, sowie in der marketing- oder kundenorientierten Projektarbeit vorweisen und hast Lust dich im Bereich Social Media Analytics weiter auszutoben. Du hast, dank deines Studiums, einen kommunikations-, sozial- oder medienwissenschaftlichen Background und bringst Kenntnisse der Methoden im Bereich der quantitativen und qualitativen Marktforschung mit. Du hast neben den analytischen Fähigkeiten, auch ein Gespür für gute kreative Kommunikation und Lust, diese mitzuentwickeln. Du bist organisiert und selbständig, willst aber auch noch ständig ganz viel lernen und verstehst dich als Teamplayer, der immer auf Höhe des Zeitgeists ist und daraus neue Impulse für unsere Teams und Kunden ableitet. Außerdem hast Du sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse in Wort und Schrift, sehr gute MS Office Kenntnisse, insbesondere Excel und PowerPoint und bist im besten Fall mit Analytics Tools im Bereich Social Listening & Web Analytics vertraut.

Darum wir

Als Teil der FUSE erfährst du stets Rückenwind von deinem Team, arbeitest für Kunden - die unsere Werte „BOLD. TRUE. EASY. TOGETHER.“ leben und kannst aktiv Prozesse und Strukturen mitentwickeln. Denn ganz getreu unserem Wert TOGETHER setzen wir auf das Potential im Team. Neben unvergesslichen Events bieten wir dir viel Raum für persönliche und berufliche Weiterentwicklung.

Als Analyst für Healthcare Analytics bist du Teil von Beratungsteams bei Klienten sowie von internen Projekten, Recherchen und Analysen zu Unternehmen und Trends in den europäischen Gesundheitssystemen. Wir sind Teil von McKinseys globalem Client Capability Network (CCN) mit mehr als 7.000 Kolleginnen und Kollegen, die unsere Klienten und Beratungsteams mit Expertise und Branchenanalysen unterstützen. Zur Verstärkung unseres Teams in Deutschland suchen wir dich zum nächstmöglichen Zeitpunkt als Analyst für Healthcare Analytics.

Das Healthcare Analytics Team nutzt Analysen und Daten aus dem Gesundheitswesen (z.B. Krankenversicherungen oder Gesundheitseinrichtungen), um einige der dringendsten Fragen unserer Klienten zu beantworten, wie zum Beispiel „Wie können wir die Kosten der Gesundheitsversorgung optimieren und gleichzeitig die Qualität verbessern?“, „Wie bleiben wir wettbewerbsfähig in der sich wandelnden Gesundheitslandschaft?“, „Wer sind die sensibelsten Patientengruppen und mit welchen Behandlungspfaden können wir ihre Versorgung verbessern?

Healthcare Analytics ist ein Team innerhalb der SHaPE-Practice (Social, Healthcare and Public Entities) mit Fokus auf die spezialisierte Beratung von Einrichtungen des Gesundheitswesens, insbesondere Kostenträger. Unser Ziel ist es mit der Unterstützung von Advanced Analytics und unseren standardisierten Methoden für Diagnostik, Optimierung und Implementierung für unsere Klienten positive und nachhaltige Veränderung zu erzielen.

Your Impact

In der Rolle als Analyst in Healthcare Analytics unterstützt du zum einen unsere Beratungsteams mit quantitativen und qualitativen Analysen und entwickelst unser Portfolio an analytischen Lösungen und innovativen Lösungsansätzen kontinuierlich weiter.

Zum anderen bist du ein fester Bestandteil der Beratungsteams beim Klienten vor Ort und bist somit direkt an der Erstellung von nachhaltigen Lösungen für unsere Klienten im Gesundheitssektor beteiligt. Letzteres erfordert Fähigkeiten im Projektmanagement und in der Kommunikation mit diversen Stakeholdern. Du wirst die Gelegenheit haben, aktiv mit Klienten aus verschiedenen Bereichen wie Krankenversicherungen, Leistungserbringern oder Private Equity zusammenzuarbeiten.

Im Healthcare Analytics Team handeln wir unternehmerisch. Daher suchen wir jemanden mit Motivation, kontinuierlich den Status Quo zu verbessern und dies auch eigenständig voranzutreiben.

Als Analyst wird erwartet, dass du Expertise in mindestens einem Segment des deutschen Gesundeitswesens (z.B. Krankenversicherungen oder Leistunserbringer) besitzt erste Erfahrungen bzw. eine Begeisterung für quantitative Analysen mitbringst. Darüber hinaus, hast du das Interesse dich in beiden Bereichen umfangreich fortzubilden und weiteres Wissen und Fähigkeiten zu erlangen.

Bei entsprechender Qualificiation ist eine Anstellung als Specialist möglich.

At Gemma, we help our clients activate data by using state-of-the-art technology. Our clients make better choices and are empowered to make use of their data on their own. We are service-focused, yet also build open-source tools to deliver a more effective and efficient service. You can read more about our data philosophy here.

Our clients range from Series A ventures to SMEs with 30 to 13,000 employees per client. We have an honest, pleasant, and fun work environment. Please make reference calls on us for validation :)

About The Job

Gemma Analytics is data-driven and helps clients to become more data-driven.

As one of our analytics engineers, you play a critical role in helping our clients to generate business value out of their existing data sets. There are no two ways about it – you’re a Data Magician. While manipulating data, you bring out the detailed information and quirky insights. You find what others can’t and glean business insights from numbers. By collaborating with clients, you find practical solutions to problems.

You have the opportunity to work on difficult problems while helping startups and SMEs to make well-informed decisions based on data.

Challenges

Collaborate and connect with domain experts to solve data obstacles in various industries
Develop advanced data reporting and visualizations

Who You Are

We believe in a good mixture of experience and upside in our team. We are looking for both types of people equally.

Optional: Experience with one or more data visualization tools
Optional: Experience with managing stakeholders and/or clients
Optional: First understanding of data modeling techniques (e.g. Data Vault or Kimball’s Dimensional Modelling) and data warehousing in general


Technologies you’ll use

Working with multiple clients, we are in touch with many technologies, which is truly exciting. We aim to use state-of-the-art technologies while being fully pragmatic (we do not crack a walnut with a sledgehammer). We follow an ELT philosophy and divide the tasks between Data Engineering and Analytics Engineering accordingly.

The Following Technologies Constitute Our Preferred Data Tech Stack


Data Loading
For most clients, we use our own open-source Python library EWAH and Apache Airflow
For simple requests, we work with Fivetran or Stitch
Data Warehousing
For smaller data loads, we mostly use PostgreSQL databases
For larger datasets, we work with Snowflake or BigQuery
Data Transformation
We love to work with data build tool (dbt)
Data Visualization


For smaller businesses with < 100 FTE, we mostly recommend Metabase as a powerful open-source reporting tool
For specified needs and a centralized BI, we recommend PowerBI or Tableau
For a decentralized, self-service BI with more than 50 users, we recommend Looker


Gemma Perks

We are located in Berlin, close to Nordbahnhof. We are currently 20 colleagues and will grow to 22 colleagues until the end of the year. Other perks include


We have an honest, inclusive work environment and want to nurture this environment
We have frequent team events in Berlin: our cultural base
We encourage workcations and even do workcations as a company - it is up to you to come to the office between one and five days a week
We don’t compromise on equipment - a powerful Laptop, extra screens, and all the tools you need to be effective
We will surround you with great people who love to solve (mostly data) riddles
We believe in efficient working hours rather than long working hours - we focus on the output rather than the input
We learn and share during meetups, lunch & learn sessions and are open for further initiatives
We pay a market-friendly salary and we additionally distribute at least 20% of profits to our employees
We are fast-growing, have technology at our core, yet we do not rely on a VC and operate profitably
We have a great yearly offsite event that brings us all together for a full week, enjoying good food, having a good time, and of course, solving complex data-related tasks solving complex data-related tasks

Dein Profil




Analytische Stärke & Business-Sinn – Du verstehst, welche Zahlen wirklich relevant sind und wie man sie sinnvoll nutzt.
Kommerzielles Gespür – Du erkennst, welche datenbasierten Entscheidungen direkten Einfluss auf das Geschäft haben.
Visualisierung – Du bereitest Daten so auf, dass sie sofort verständlich und einprägsam sind.
Storytelling mit Daten – Du kannst aus Zahlen eine klare, überzeugende Geschichte machen, die Entscheidungen vorantreibt.

The ability to interpret complex football data and to communicate the actionable insights in a concise and compelling manner in both written and verbal presentation formats to both internal and external audiences (varying in their knowledge of football data) is fundamental.

Key Tasks And Responsibilities


Use your exceptional knowledge of football data to derive accurate insights on professional football players, managers/coaches, and team tactical systems – translating and communicating these in both written and verbal formats to an exceptional standard to colleagues, clients, and other key stakeholders.
Work closely with the Design & Analysis team internally to optimally leverage data insights within presentations and other documentation.
Play a leading role in the recruitment process of new clients (identifying, tracking and monitoring talent both at a senior and youth level), development of existing clients, and contract negotiation processes through the application of data analysis.
Deliver presentations & discuss football from a data-driven perspective in an articulate and engaging manner – to audiences with a variety of technical knowledge (both in terms of football & data!).
Stay aware of the latest developments and research within the ‘football analytics’ industry.
Build and develop relationships with data analysts working in clubs.
Enhance existing processes & workflows – apply the analytical tools developed by our Data Scientists, and work with them to continuously ideate future solutions and new methods by combining technical expertise with football knowledge to solve unique challenges in football analytics, where traditional methods often need to be adapted or reinvented.

Exceptional verbal and written communication skills in English to present insights clearly and concisely –including experience presenting insights to both technical & non-technical audiences.
Ability to manipulate data in MS Excel (at least).

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

East London (Hybrid - 3 days per week)
£40,000 - £55,000 DOE

We're working with a fast-moving, customer-focused telco brand looking to bring in two Data Analysts - one more junior, one more mid-level - to help drive insight across their commercial and customer landscape.

This is a great opportunity for someone with solid SQL skills who wants hands-on experience, meaningful projects, and genuine growth opportunities (with a clear path to promotion over the next 12-24 months). You'll be working closely with a hands-on Head of Analytics, senior stakeholders, and cross-functional teams across the business.

The Role

Handle ad-hoc data pulls and reporting requests

Take ownership of dashboarding (Power BI), and improve visualisation/reporting processes

Deep dive into customer data - churn analysis, CLV projects, marketing campaign performance

Collaborate with commercial, marketing, and country teams on strategic projects (e.g. handset launches, global campaign success)

Help improve data quality across the business and support wider insight efforts

Present findings to senior stakeholders, including finance and country managers

What They're Looking For

SQL is essential - window functions, joins, aggregations for the mid-level role

Strong business acumen and commercial thinking

Experience in customer/marketing analytics or a real desire to develop in that space

Bonus: Power BI, Python, exposure to presenting insights to non-technical audiences

Personality and mindset matter - curiosity, drive, and a collaborative approach are key

Salary

Junior Analyst: £40,000-£45,000

Mid-Level Analyst: Up to £55,000

Interview Process

Stage 1: Informal 30-min Teams chat with the Head of Analytics

Stage 2: Presentation round + Q&A with the team

Optional sign-off with a senior stakeholder

This is an exciting chance to step into a role with visibility, variety, and loads of room to grow. Let us know if you'd like to hear more.

Hi, I’m Tobias, Director of Data Analytics at WebPros, and your future manager. With nearly 20 years of experience in the hosting industry as a developer and BI analyst, I joined WebPros over seven years ago as a data scientist. Throughout my time at WebPros, I initially contributed as a developer and later transitioned into a leadership role, helping to create a comprehensive reporting infrastructure that serves the entire organization.

This role is all about impact. We are looking for a Data Analyst to help us derive actionable insights and enhance data-driven decision-making. If you love autonomy, problem-solving, and working in an async-first, globally distributed team, this is an exciting opportunity to shape the future of our data analytics infrastructure.

You’ll thrive in this role if you’re comfortable navigating data landscapes, driving projects independently, and collaborating across teams to translate business needs into suitable reports and dashboards. If you’re excited about solving reporting challenges with SQL, Looker, and cloud technologies, you’ll find a great home here.

Below, you’ll find everything you need to decide if this role is right for you. From our culture and work style to the specifics of the position and hiring process. We believe in transparency, so we’ve put in the effort to give you a real, inside look at what it’s like to work here.

About WebPros

WebPros is committed to empowering businesses worldwide through cutting-edge solutions in web hosting, billing automation, infrastructure, server management, and online marketing. Since our founding in 2017, we’ve rapidly grown into a global leader, expanding our robust portfolio to include industry-defining brands such as cPanel & WHM, Plesk, WHMCS, SolusVM, NIXStats, XOVI, SocialBee, and Sitejet.

Today, we power 85 million+ websites across 900,000+ servers worldwide, backed by a 600+ strong team of dedicated professionals spanning multiple continents. At WebPros, we embrace a fully remote, borderless workplace with a focus on flexibility, autonomy, and work-life balance. Whether you prefer working from a bustling city hub or a quiet home office, we enable our teams to thrive from anywhere while staying deeply connected through our strong collaborative culture.

Your Role

We are looking for a remote Data Analyst to help design, build, and optimize our reporting infrastructure. You will work with Google BigQuery, SQL, Looker Studio and similar reporting tools to develop interactive and insightful dashboards, build data models, and deliver data-driven insights.

Your Impact In The First 180 Days

We don’t believe in endless checklists of requirements. Instead, here’s what success looks like in your first 6 months:


30 Days: Get fully onboarded and familiarize yourself with our data infrastructure. Connect with stakeholders across teams to understand potential data needs and identify opportunities for improving current reporting, while also recognizing efficient practices.
60 Days: Deploy your first production-ready updates. Collaborate with the members of the analytics and engineering teams to experiment with dashboard optimizations that enhance reliability and incorporate best practices.
120 Days: You are ready to deploy new dashboards, which involves collaborating with business users, stakeholders, and data source owners. Additionally, you are familiar with the data infrastructure across the organisation and ready to understand the reporting needs of the business.
After 180 Days: You have become an invaluable member of the data analytics team. You have made a significant impact by introducing solutions that enhance the efficiency of dashboards and reporting and improve data quality and monitoring capabilities.


By this point, you won’t just be executing tasks. You’ll be making strategic contributions, improving how we report and share data across the organization, and positioning yourself as a key player in our Data & AI team.

You’ll Thrive Here If You


Have strong experience in dashboarding and reporting, general data analytics, SQL, along with experience in cloud providers such as Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure.
Can independently apply these skills to real-world challenges.
Take ownership of projects from concept to deployment, proactively solving problems and driving impact.
Enjoy working in an async-first, globally distributed team that values autonomy and deep work.
Excel in fast-paced environments where cross-functional collaboration is key to success.


You Might Struggle Here If You


Prefer highly structured roles with rigid processes and step-by-step workflows.
Find it challenging to navigate ambiguity or adapt to changing priorities.
Require constant guidance rather than taking initiative and driving your own work.
Are seeking an entry-level position with extensive hands-on mentorship.


How We Work


Team & Workflow: Fully remote, async-first team (CET timezone). We follow an Agile-inspired Scrumban workflow, minimizing meetings (~10-20% of the workweek) and prioritizing deep work.
Collaboration & Ownership: Self-managed work with a strong emphasis on accountability, autonomy, and decision-making.
Tech Stack & Tools: Google BigQuery, Looker Studio.
Cloud & Infrastructure: Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Testing & Quality: Shift-left approach, high test coverage.
Releases & CI/CD: Fully automated CI/CD, daily releases, no strict release cycles.


Our Culture

WebPros is built on diversity, not just in principle but by design. We’ve grown through acquiring industry-leading brands, bringing together teams from 42+ nationalities, 20+ countries, and 10+ brands. Instead of enforcing a one-size-fits-all culture, we embrace unique perspectives, different working styles, and localized expertise to drive global innovation.

We are a fully remote, async-friendly company where transparency, open communication, and collaborative problem-solving define how we work. Whether you thrive in the fast pace of a startup or the stability of an established product, WebPros offers a dynamic, evolving career journey that you can shape based on your strengths.

We are committed to fostering an inclusive, equitable workplace where every team member feels valued, heard, and supported because our diversity is our strength.

Compensation & Benefits

We believe benefits go beyond just perks. At WebPros, we invest in your growth, flexibility, and well-being, so you can do your best work and build a meaningful career. While we strive to provide equal global benefits for all team members, some may vary by location, and we’ll clarify the details with you during the interview process.


Competitive salary
Remote-first flexibility: Work from anywhere in Europe (or hybrid in available offices).
Development Budget: Annual personal growth allowance.
Learning Support: Udemy subscription & peer learning.
Public Transport & Meal Vouchers: Location-dependent benefits.
Paid Time Off: The number of days of annual leave is dependent on your location.
Team Culture: Regular team and on-site company events.


Your Hiring Experience

Hi, I’m Florian, your Talent Partner for EMEA at WebPros. I’ll guide you through the interview process, ensuring a clear, transparent, and meaningful experience. Before moving into talent and culture, I was a software engineer, so I understand what it’s like to navigate technical hiring. My goal is to make this process a genuine, two-way conversation where you feel informed, valued, and empowered to make the best decision for your career.

Hiring is about relationships, not just resumes. You can expect honest, constructive feedback at every step, and I welcome yours as well. No matter the outcome, I want this to be a positive and insightful experience. If you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn.

Interview Process


Screening Interview (30 min): A conversation with Florian to get to know each other, and introduce you to WebPros, our culture, and your potential team. We’ll discuss your motivation, career aspirations, and how your experience aligns with the role while giving you as much insight as possible into what to expect.
Hiring Manager Interview (45 min): Discussion with Tobias to assess team fit, self-reliance, technical alignment, and problem-solving skills.
Technical & Culture Interview (60 min): Deep dive into technical expertise, problem-solving, adaptability, and data handling, followed by a cultural fit discussion with two team members.
Offer Talk (30 min): Final conversation with Tobias and Florian to review offer details and answer any remaining questions.


Our Commitment to a Diverse & Inclusive Culture

At WebPros, we want every team member to feel excited to bring their full, authentic self to work. Our strength lies in the diversity of our people, with different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences driving innovation and making us stronger together.

We are committed to ensuring equitable opportunities, pay, and support for all employees, regardless of identity, background, or circumstances. We foster a culture of belonging, respect, and psychological safety, where everyone feels valued, heard, and empowered to contribute meaningfully and grow.

Discrimination of any kind, including sexism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and ageism, has no place here. By embracing differences and championing inclusivity, we create an environment where everyone can thrive.

We are looking forward to your application!

Best,

Tobias & Florian

About the Company

A leading name in the UK property sector is on the hunt for a mid-level Data Analyst to join their growing data team. With a strong foundation in Business Intelligence and a forward-thinking approach to tech, this company has spent the last five years investing heavily in their data infrastructure and are now gearing up to take things even further - including AI implementation over the next 6-12 months. 🚀

They're working on internal data projects with real commercial impact and are looking for someone who can not only crunch the numbers, but also tell the story behind them.

The Role

You'll take the lead on key analytics initiatives, working end-to-end across data pipelines, visualisation, and stakeholder communication. It's a hands-on role with plenty of variety - perfect for someone who enjoys making sense of messy data and translating that into insight that drives decisions.

What You'll Be Doing

📈 Lead dashboard development using Power BI, delivering enterprise-grade reports that drive business insight
🔍 End-to-end data analysis, from extraction and transformation to insight using SQL and Python
🗣️ Present findings to stakeholders across all levels, breaking down complex analysis into clear, commercial terms
👥 Run workshops/training to help non-technical users engage with dashboards and tools
🤖 Contribute to AI initiative, including mining sales data, building feedback prompts, and extracting insights from customer conversations

The Ideal Candidate

Has spent a few years working in data-focused roles, with solid hands-on experience in real-world commercial environments.
Brings a strong academic foundation, ideally in a technical or numerical subject such as Maths, Physics, Engineering, or Computer Science.
Comfortable owning projects end-to-end, from working with raw data to presenting insights that drive business decisions.
A confident communicator who can explain complex analysis in a simple, engaging way.
Technically fluent with Power BI, SQL, and Python, and eager to work with modern tools like Fabric and Copilot.
Curious, analytical, and thrives in a fast-paced, collaborative setting.

💡 This role is ideal for someone looking to step into a more visible, hands-on position where they can shape how data is used across a business - and get early exposure to AI innovation in a real-world commercial setting.

East London (Hybrid - 3 days per week)
£40,000 - £55,000 DOE

We're working with a fast-moving, customer-focused telco brand looking to bring in two Data Analysts - one more junior, one more mid-level - to help drive insight across their commercial and customer landscape.

This is a great opportunity for someone with solid SQL skills who wants hands-on experience, meaningful projects, and genuine growth opportunities (with a clear path to promotion over the next 12-24 months). You'll be working closely with a hands-on Head of Analytics, senior stakeholders, and cross-functional teams across the business.

The Role

Handle ad-hoc data pulls and reporting requests

Take ownership of dashboarding (Power BI), and improve visualisation/reporting processes

Deep dive into customer data - churn analysis, CLV projects, marketing campaign performance

Collaborate with commercial, marketing, and country teams on strategic projects (e.g. handset launches, global campaign success)

Help improve data quality across the business and support wider insight efforts

Present findings to senior stakeholders, including finance and country managers

What They're Looking For

SQL is essential - window functions, joins, aggregations for the mid-level role

Strong business acumen and commercial thinking

Experience in customer/marketing analytics or a real desire to develop in that space

Bonus: Power BI, Python, exposure to presenting insights to non-technical audiences

Personality and mindset matter - curiosity, drive, and a collaborative approach are key

Salary

Junior Analyst: £40,000-£45,000

Mid-Level Analyst: Up to £55,000

Interview Process

Stage 1: Informal 30-min Teams chat with the Head of Analytics

Stage 2: Presentation round + Q&A with the team

Optional sign-off with a senior stakeholder

This is an exciting chance to step into a role with visibility, variety, and loads of room to grow. Let us know if you'd like to hear more.

At Zego, we understand that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't reflect how well you actually drive. Since 2016, we have been on a mission to change that by offering the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are the driving force behind everything we do. We've sold tens of millions of policies and raised over $200 million in funding. And we're only just getting started.


Overview of team

The mission of the BI & Analytics team at Zego is to deliver relevant and reliable information to the right people at the right time, enabling rapid and effective decision-making supported by data.  It is a small and dynamic team, responsible for all the aspects related to data, including making data available, data cleaning, extraction, problem formulation and definition of success metrics, reporting and analytics.


About the Role

We are seeking a passionate Senior Business Intelligence Analyst with a strong commercial mindset and a genuine love for data. This role isn't just about surfacing numbers- it's about transforming data into meaningful insights that support strategic decisions. You'll play a pivotal role in enabling teams across the business to make informed, data-driven decisions.

To thrive in this role, you'll need a solid technical foundation in analytics, strong stakeholder management skills, and the ability to operate in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.



What you will be doing

You will collaborate closely with the Data, Engineering, Product, Marketing, Customer Experience, Pricing, Claims & Fraud teams, and senior leadership to identify and evaluate the primary KPIs influencing conversion and performance

You will monitor business performance regularly, conduct ad-hoc analyses, and proactively offer recommendations to Senior Leaders to enhance team performance while identifying growth opportunities or business risks

You will own reporting - set up and maintain reports and dashboards using various technical tools (SQL, Looker, Excel, etc.) to assess KPIs and track them over time

You will be responsible for making data available to internal and external stakeholders in a digestible form. This might include designing and create appropriate ETL processes and partnering with the Data Analytics and Data Engineering teams to implement them

You will work closely with Customer Support, Product and Engineering teams to help prioritise new products and features with the aim of constantly improving the customer experience. Your recommendations will be data-driven, influenced by consumer behaviour, revenue impact, ROI and market trends

You will provide support for modeling and forecasting to comprehend the efforts required to achieve business targets


About you

You have experience in the insurance industry, with a strong understanding of how commercial and insurance metrics connect- including how claims flow and underwriting performance impact business outcome

You've worked in Analytics or BI teams, acting as a true partner to the business- reporting, analysing, and turning data into meaningful insights.

You're comfortable building dashboards (we use Looker) and have advanced Excel skills. You also have a strong grasp of SQL and how to write efficient, business-relevant queries.

You're a strategic thinker and problem solver who thrives in a fast-paced, dynamic environment- especially when juggling multiple deadlines.

You're curious and growth-oriented- always looking to expand your technical skills, explore different areas of analytics, and take ownership of your development.

You're confident managing stakeholders across varying levels of seniority, able to translate a flood of requests into a clear, prioritised plan and set expectations along the way.

You have a collaborative mindset. You see your work as part of a team effort, and you're equally happy leading your own initiatives or jumping in to support others

Bonus points

BS/BA in Mathematics, Engineering, Finance, Economics, or similar
Familiarity with Python or R
Previous experience in a rapidly growing startup, InsurTech, or FinTech
Prior experience in developing ETL processes and financial modeling

Jane is a remote-first company, so every role, including this one, gives you the freedom to work from anywhere in Canada.

Your Role In Our Journey

Jane is looking for a Senior Data Analyst who will be responsible for delivering consistent, meaningful insights across the company with a focus on supporting our Marketing team. You will have strong experience with SQL, dbt, Looker and preferably experience in a fast growing software company.

The impact you could have


Collaborate with the Marketing team to create and improve existing metrics, models, and documentation across multiple subject areas.
Own analysis from concept to implementation, build Looker reports and dashboards and sharing results with relevant stakeholders.
Develop and optimize Looker dashboards to surface insights and track business performance.
Help build and refine data models using DBT and Snowflake.
Build and maintain data pipelines to drive decision-making.
Work with ambiguous or incomplete requirements — identify gaps, ask the right questions, and deliver valuable insights.


The Experience We Feel We Need


5+ years experience as a data analyst in a high growth environment
Strong experience with SQL, DBT, and Looker — able to write complex queries, model data effectively, and create insightful dashboards.
Excellent communication skills and the ability to explain technical insights to non-technical audiences.
Experience working with marketing teams to define business requirements and drive insights.
Ability to take initiative and ownership, comfortable working independently and seeing projects through to completion.

Experience with SQL query optimization and performance tuning
Familiarity with different data architectures (e.g., star vs snowflake schema)


Compensation Expectations For The Role

Jane’s committed to paying our team members fairly, clearly, and above all, paying for growth. This role has a minimum annual salary of $97,600 and maximum annual salary of $152,400. As you may have noticed, this salary range is quite large, and this is intentional to account for the growth someone will experience in the role throughout their time at Jane (i.e., from building the skills, to accomplished, to highly proficient, all the way to achieving excellence in the role). When hiring talented folks to join the Jane team, we’ve found that new team members are best set up for success when hired with the expectation of being fully accomplished in the role, which for this role would reflect a starting salary of $115,900.

It's also possible to join Jane at a salary above or below this, which would mean a salary below $115,900 typically reflects someone who has all the potential to be fully accomplished in the role but doesn't yet possess all the skills required, while a salary above $115,900 is typically for individuals who are currently in this role at Jane and had the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on our customers, product and company with deep Jane knowledge. At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.

Paying clearly is one of our compensation fundamentals to help folks build trust in the compensation process at Jane. To better understand Jane’s compensation fundamentals and how this range is determined, click on this link here for a short video walkthrough of how it all works! We also welcome you to ask as many questions as you’d like about compensation throughout the interview process to ensure you feel confident and build trust through the process.

And guess what? Jane is a remote-first company, so every role, including this one, gives you the freedom to work from anywhere in Canada.<br><br><strong>Your Role In Our Journey<br><br></strong>Jane is looking for a Senior Data Analyst who will be responsible for delivering consistent, meaningful insights across the company with a focus on supporting our Marketing team.

If you're the kind of person who gets a kick out of being resourceful and loves solving problems, we would love to hear from you.<br><br>No doubt, Jane's a special place to work. There is autonomy and flexibility to help integrate work into your life in a way that makes sense for you. Need to block out time to pick up the kids? Go for it. That's normal here.

Let’s kick things off with a quick intro. Jane is a team that’s all about fostering growth, spreading delight, and serving our healthcare community. We’re looking for people who are ready to jump in and join us as we simplify the lives of healthcare practitioners and patients every day.

At Jane, success means collaborating with your team, delivering an aligned result with efficiency and quality, communicating clearly and openly, and embracing continuous improvement. And guess what? Jane is a remote-first company, so every role, including this one, gives you the freedom to work from anywhere in Canada.

Your Role In Our Journey

Jane is looking for a Senior Data Analyst who will be responsible for delivering consistent, meaningful insights across the company with a focus on supporting our Marketing team. You will have strong experience with SQL, dbt, Looker and preferably experience in a fast growing software company. We're looking for someone who thrives in a fast-paced environment, enjoys working with stakeholders to solve business problems, and is excited about working with data that drives business impact. You’ll have the opportunity to shape how Jane uses data to improve product adoption, customer retention, and marketing efficiency. At Jane, we value transparency, ownership, and a problem-solving mindset. If you’re excited about working with data to unlock business insights and help shape decision-making, this could be the perfect role for you.

Learn More About Us

We're founder-led, which means we live our values while maintaining a clear vision for the future. Our product enables the likes of physiotherapists, mental health counsellors, chiropractors, and other allied health practitioners to run their practices in a digital-first way through features such as online booking, charting, scheduling, telehealth, secure payments and billing along with an evolving library of features. You can see more of them here .

We're a company that is growing rapidly, and with that comes the challenge of navigating an environment with many moving parts, often without a clear-cut path laid out in front of us. If you're the kind of person who gets a kick out of being resourceful and loves solving problems, we would love to hear from you.

No doubt, Jane's a special place to work. There is autonomy and flexibility to help integrate work into your life in a way that makes sense for you. Need to block out time to pick up the kids? Go for it. That's normal here. And yes, we have a Slack channel for parents, but we've also got channels dedicated to plants, furry friends, food, pride, wellness - you get the idea! While we love to connect virtually, the Jane team also connects in person throughout the year.

We believe in collaboration, humility, and keeping a growth mindset. We're looking for people who can embrace our way of working, which often means being flexible and open to change. So, if after reading this, you feel excited about the opportunity — all in the name of helping those who help others — reach out to us to learn more.

Compensation Expectations For The Role

Jane’s committed to paying our team members fairly, clearly, and above all, paying for growth. This role has a minimum annual salary of $97,600 and maximum annual salary of $152,400. As you may have noticed, this salary range is quite large, and this is intentional to account for the growth someone will experience in the role throughout their time at Jane (i.e., from building the skills, to accomplished, to highly proficient, all the way to achieving excellence in the role). When hiring talented folks to join the Jane team, we’ve found that new team members are best set up for success when hired with the expectation of being fully accomplished in the role, which for this role would reflect a starting salary of $115,900.

It's also possible to join Jane at a salary above or below this, which would mean a salary below $115,900 typically reflects someone who has all the potential to be fully accomplished in the role but doesn't yet possess all the skills required, while a salary above $115,900 is typically for individuals who are currently in this role at Jane and had the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on our customers, product and company with deep Jane knowledge. At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.

Paying clearly is one of our compensation fundamentals to help folks build trust in the compensation process at Jane. To better understand Jane’s compensation fundamentals and how this range is determined, click on this link here for a short video walkthrough of how it all works! We also welcome you to ask as many questions as you’d like about compensation throughout the interview process to ensure you feel confident and build trust through the process.

At Jane, we’re committed to fostering an environment that allows you to come to work as your truest self. We believe it’s important to actively recognize, embrace, and celebrate our differences in order to make Jane an inclusive, equitable, and diverse workplace.

We want to build a team of people who make conversations rich with perspective and experience. We are committed to listening to every voice in order to learn and grow because doing this will allow us to meet the needs of the diverse community of helpers that Jane serves.

We do not tolerate discrimination, prejudice, or oppressive isms of any kind. Employment is decided on the basis of qualifications, merit, experience, and the needs of the Jane community. We encourage anyone who requires accommodation or adjustments throughout the interview process to let us know, and we will do our best to support you.

As you may have noticed, this salary range is quite large, and this is intentional to account for the growth someone will experience in the role throughout their time at Jane (i.e., from building the skills, to accomplished, to highly proficient, all the way to achieving excellence in the role). When hiring talented folks to join the Jane team, we’ve found that new team members are best set up for success when hired with the expectation of being accomplished in the role, which for this role would reflect a starting salary of $141,000.

It's also possible to join Jane at a salary above or below this, which would mean a salary below $141,000 typically reflects someone who has all the potential to be fully accomplished in the role but doesn't yet possess all the skills required, while a salary above $141,000 is typically for individuals who are currently in this role at Jane and had the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on our customers, product and company with deep Jane knowledge. At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources
Define and monitor key economic impact metrics
Go deep on understanding business drivers, user segments, cohorts and macroeconomic trends
Prepare presentations, analyses and visualizations for internal and external executive audiences
Partner closely with Communications, Policy, Marketing and Product teams to identify and analyze key trends and produce thought leadership pieces and campaign content leveraging Stripe data
Collaborate with external vendors, academics, and think tanks to advance Stripe’s research agenda and advocacy positions



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We are a rapidly growing organization with clients from Fortune 500 companies to leading Silicon Valley tech startups.

We’re scaling fast — and we need a Data Analyst who can dive deep, query like a boss, and help us make data-driven decisions in real time.

This is a remote, contract role (part-time or full-time) with immediate start. You’ll work alongside product, finance, and ops to build the backbone of our SaaS reporting engine.

Build out live dashboards in tools like Retool or Looker Studio
Help define and automate SaaS KPIs: MRR, ARR, LTV, CAC, churn, expansion, cohort analytics, and more
Connect data sources (Stripe, CRM, app backend, etc.) to make real-time insights accessible to the team


Tools You Should Know


Must-Have: Stripe Sigma, PostgreSQL, Retool, Google Sheets/Excel
Nice-to-Have: Metabase, Looker Studio, BigQuery, Chartio, Snowflake, Python
Bonus: Experience building dashboards directly in Stripe, using Sigma + external tools


What We’re Looking For


Strong experience querying large datasets with SQL
Solid understanding of SaaS metrics and growth levers
Ability to go from raw data to insights & visuals quickly
Comfortable working async in a fast-paced remote environment


Salary : $20–$25/hr depending on experience

Benefits: 11 Days PTO + Christmas Day + New Years Day paid off

Life at Search Atlas Group

At Search Atlas Group, we are committed to enjoying life as we are to delivering best-in-class services and software. From community volunteer days, socially conscious initiatives, and team lunches and outings, our office reflects our team’s diverse interests.

We’re a growing team of diverse professionals, however, we all share the same goals: to be a part of a company that’s on the edge of digital marketing, to make the world a better place, and to have fun doing it. Our team culture is one of fast-paced innovation, where each person is empowered to take on their own ambitious projects, with the support of their teammates. We’ve got plenty of perks, but the biggest one is working with other energetic high-achievers.

We Are Very Proud Of The Kind, Inclusive, And Collaborative Company Culture We Have Built And Have Been Very Lucky To Be Recognized By Both National And Local Industry Leaders

Here's a Look Into Our Core Values


Collaborative and Highly Engaged


Work is where we invest a big chunk of our lives. And hey, we're all about making that time awesome! Picture this: we're not just coworkers; we're like a squad that's always got each other's backs. We're all about cheering each other on, sharing what we know, and picking each other up when things get messy. Plus, we're big on being real with each other, so there's no room for office drama or gossip. We're all about that good vibes-only vibe!


Pursues Excellence


We're not just about doing our jobs; we're on a mission to master our craft. With a growth mindset and a desire to learn and grow, we're relentless in our pursuit of excellence. Mediocrity? Nah, not our style. We're all about raising the bar and becoming the absolute best in our field. Smashing goals? It's our fuel. And we do it all together, thriving on shared success.


I can figure it out/Google it attitude


Hey, nobody's got all the answers, right? That's why our team rocks - because they're all about that thirst for knowledge and the know-how to quench it. Thanks to the vast wonders of the internet, there's practically nothing we can't figure out. Stumped on something? No sweat, just dive into the Google pool!


Innovative


We're all about agility, evolution, and innovation. Flexibility is our middle name—we're constantly refining, experimenting, and pushing boundaries. New ideas? Bring 'em on! Creativity is our secret sauce, and thinking outside the box is just how we roll. Forget about the status quo; we're all about embracing change. We're not attached to an old way of doing things - We're attached to winning.


Student Mentality


We dedicate ourselves to uplifting each other and pushing Search Atlas onwards and upwards (to the moon!). Mistakes and rough days happen to everyone, but we approach them with understanding and trust in each other's good intentions. Our team remains grounded and committed, persistently striving to improve. Mistakes are opportunities for growth; we embrace them, learn from them, and continually evolve as a result.

At Trader Interactive, we make buying and selling a great experience. We’re a group of go-getters who decided they didn’t want to settle for the status quo.

When it comes to your career, we want to provide big opportunities to help you make a big impact. But for this to be possible, we strive to feel small. Small enough to quickly change tack, small enough to learn from different teams and small enough to connect authentically with leadership.




And one of the best parts? We give you the freedom to work from whatever working location works best for you and your lifestyle - yes, this means you can be 100% remote if you want to be!




What We Offer




An inclusive and supportive work environment where you can move your career forward and will have the chance to do work that has real, significant impact on the world.
The opportunity to be a part of a global group of digital marketplace businesses (CAR Group) located across Australia, Brazil, Chile and South Korea - collectively we have around 1,800 team members worldwide, and our Global Talent Exchange Program means you might just find yourself working in one of those businesses sometime soon.
Plenty of flexible leave options and employee benefits including up to 31 days of paid time off in your first year, continuing education with access to LinkedIn Learning, a full benefits package including medical, dental & vision, 401K with company match, and wellness program.




What You’ll Do




We’re looking for a Senior Data Analyst to join our team and drive insights that enhance our customers’ understanding of user behavior and the path to purchase. This individual will play a key role in analyzing marketplace data across multiple websites to inform data-driven media planning & marketing decisions for our partners.




Analyze user behavior to identify interests, predict actions, and map the path to purchase for RVs, motorcycles, boats, and commercial equipment
Develop and maintain dashboards and reports using tools like Tableau and Power BI to enable self-serve insights for sales teams
Work on sales attribution by combining cross-category sales data with on-site user shopping behavior to support the value of our partnerships
Leverage multiple data sources to create innovative visualizations that better depict user engagement and the customer journey
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to design the next generation of insights and analysis frameworks
Provide actionable recommendations to improve customer engagement and product performance throughout the purchase journey




What We’re Looking For




4+ years of experience in data analysis, ideally within the media or digital space
Proficiency in tools like Tableau, Power BI, and SQL
Strong analytical skills with experience in user behavior analysis and predictive modeling
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to present complex data in an easily understandable manner
Experience working with diverse data sets and creating compelling visualizations




Bonus Points:




Bachelor’s degree in Data Science, Analytics, Statistics, or a related field (or equivalent experience)
Basic coding skills in Python, R, or a similar language to support data preparation and advanced analysis




So come and join our team - because every role is a big role in our plans to go big.

Our Purpose

At Deloitte, our Purpose is to make an impact that matters. We exist to inspire and help our people, organizations, communities, and countries to thrive by building a better future. Our work underpins a prosperous society where people can find meaning and opportunity. It builds consumer and business confidence, empowers organizations to find imaginative ways of deploying capital, enables fair, trusted, and functioning social and economic institutions, and allows our friends, families, and communities to enjoy the quality of life that comes with a sustainable future. And as the largest 100% Canadian-owned and operated professional services firm in our country, we are proud to work alongside our clients to make a positive impact for all Canadians.

By living our Purpose, we will make an impact that matters.





Lead the way across a diverse breadth of clients as they wrestle with implications of how Artificial Intelligence is changing the landscape of their industries.

What will your typical day look like?

As a Consultant or Analyst on the AI and Data team, you'll collaborate with cross-functional experts to solve complex client problems at the intersection of business and AI. Your day could include:


Facilitating workshops or stakeholder interviews to understand strategic challenges.
Designing future-state visions and building use cases that apply Artificial Intelligence, Generative AI, and Advanced Analytics in creative, value-generating ways.
Supporting the development of Proofs of Concept, governance models, and roadmaps to turn ideas into action.
Contributing to storytelling through decks, written briefs, and compelling visuals to help clients align on their AI strategy.
Working alongside data scientists, engineers, and strategists to define and deliver data-driven solutions across industries like financial services, healthcare, energy, and the public sector.


You’ll thrive if you're energized by ambiguity, complexity, and the opportunity to bridge the gap between technical teams and business leaders.

About The Team

We are Canadia’s premier AI and data consulting practice, with over 300 professionals across Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, and Calgary. We're shaping the future of AI by combining cutting-edge research, real-world delivery, and human-centered design.

Our team is multidisciplinary, including strategists, technologists, designers, and data scientists. We tackle some of the most pressing and complex challenges across:


Enterprise AI strategy and GenAI applications
AI governance, privacy, and ethics
Advanced analytics, intelligent automation, and AI-powered operating models
Industry-specific innovation across public sector, healthcare, finance, and customer experience


We’re collaborative, fast-moving, and future-focused – and we’re looking for people who are too.

Enough about us, let’s talk about you

You are someone who speaks the language of both business and AI. You don’t need to code like a developer, but you should understand what’s possible (and what’s not) with modern AI, data, and analytics. More importantly, you can translate that understanding into meaningful business impact.

Good-to-have:


An undergraduate and/or master’s degree from an accredited institution
Strong interest in AI, data, or analytics, demonstrated through projects, coursework, internships, or extracurriculars
Strong organizational skills with ability to work independently and follow through on complex tasks
Confident communicator with strong verbal and written skills, and the ability to adapt your style to different audiences
Proficient in PowerPoint and Excel (or equivalent tools to communicate ideas clearly)
Comfortable with ambiguity, fast-paced environments, and collaborative problem solving


Nice-to-have:


Prior internship or co-op experience in consulting, strategy, business analytics, or a relevant sector
Sector experience in public sector, financial services, life sciences and healthcare, natural resources, or customer/marketing
Knowledge of data governance, information architecture, data engineering, and data visualization
Experience or education in data science, advanced analytics, or machine learning, including GenAI, Agentic AI, LLM or similar emerging technologies


Total Rewards

The salary range for this position is $57,000 - $102,000, and individuals may be eligible to participate in our bonus program. Deloitte is fair and competitive when it comes to the salaries of our people. We regularly benchmark across a variety of positions, industries, sectors, targets, and levels. Our approach is grounded on recognizing people's unique strengths and contributions and rewarding the value that they deliver.

Our Total Rewards Package extends well beyond traditional compensation and benefit programs and is designed to recognize employee contributions, encourage personal wellness, and support firm growth. Along with a competitive base salary and variable pay opportunities, we offer a wide array of initiatives that differentiate us as a people-first organization. On top of our regular paid vacation days, some examples include: $4,000 per year for mental health support benefits, a $1,300 flexible benefit spending account, firm-wide closures known as ""Deloitte Days"", dedicated days of for learning (known as Development and Innovation Days), flexible work arrangements and a hybrid work structure.

Our promise to our people: Deloitte is where potential comes to life.

Be yourself, and more.

We are a group of talented people who want to learn, gain experience, and develop skills. Wherever you are in your career, we want you to advance.

You Shape How We Make Impact.

Diverse perspectives and life experiences make us better. Whoever you are and wherever you’re from, we want you to feel like you belong here. We provide flexible working options to support you and how you can contribute.

Be the leader you want to be

Some guide teams, some change culture, some build essential expertise. We offer opportunities and experiences that support your continuing growth as a leader.

Have as many careers as you want.

We are uniquely able to offer you new challenges and roles – and prepare you for them. We bring together people with unique experiences and talents, and we are the place to develop a lasting network of friends, peers, and mentors.

The next step is yours

We acknowledge that Deloitte offices stand on traditional, treaty, and unceded territories in what is now known as Canada.

We acknowledge this land is still home to many First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Peoples, who continue to maintain their deep connection to the land and its sacred teachings.

Title Data Analyst Job Status Regular Full Time Position Overview

The City of North Vancouver is the urban core of the beautiful North Shore and has a long-term vision to be “The Healthiest Small City in the World”, with five key priorities to be a City for People, a Resilient City, a Vibrant City, a Connected City and a Prosperous City.

The Information Technology department requires a highly driven and innovative Data Analyst to support data initiatives that enhance decision-making and operational effectiveness across municipal services. This role will play a key part in shaping the City’s data strategy by developing and implementing business intelligence solutions, ensuring data integrity, and promoting a data-driven culture. The ideal candidate will leverage their expertise in data wrangling, analytics, and visualization to support strategic priorities and drive innovation within municipal operations.

Responsibilities

Reporting to the Manager of Data Services, you will research, identify, and compile datasets from diverse sources to support business needs. You will develop and implement ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows to validate, process, and integrate structured data, leveraging statistical analysis, data modeling techniques, and business intelligence tools to uncover key patterns, trends, and anomalies. Additionally, you will design and develop interactive dashboards, reports, and data visualizations that effectively communicate performance metrics and insights to stakeholders, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Collaboration with cross-functional teams will be essential to understand data requirements and maintain data accuracy, consistency, and integrity. As a subject matter expert in data analytics, you will provide guidance on best practices for data management and analytics while actively exploring emerging technologies in data science to recommend innovative tools that enhance the City’s data analytics and reporting capabilities.

Requirements

Strong communication skills are crucial for translating complex data into clear, actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders. Familiarity with spatial data, ArcGIS applications within a municipal setting is also a significant asset.

The ideal candidate will have a Bachelor’s degree in computer science, mathematics, statistics, data science, or a related field, plus sound related experience in quantitative data analytics, business intelligence, and data modeling. An equivalent combination of education, training, and experience will also be considered.
