About Us

Baobab's mission is to protect SMEs against cyber attacks better.

We rethink Cyber protection for SMEs by integrating Cyber Insurance with preventive cyber security services.

Like the Baobab tree, Baobab stands for security and support in all circumstances. We help our partners, as well as customers, to better understand cyber (risks). We not only focus on remediation after an incident but also reduce the likelihood of such an event.

We are supported by renowned investors such as Project A, and La Famiglia. In Zurich Insurance, we also have a solid partner with whom we have made a dynamic start as a risk carrier in the market.

Why is cyber insurance important for SMEs? Regardless of size, every business has vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit. Just because a company is small doesn't mean it can't be a target of a cyber-attack. The cyber sector is so fast-moving that there is always a residual risk here, which should then be insured.

We believe that diversity in the team makes the company stronger. We do not discriminate on the basis of religion, skin color, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, or disability and welcome applications from all backgrounds. Apply now to become part of our team!

Getreu unserem Motto – People is what makes us us – sind uns deine nachhaltige Ausbildung und Weiterentwicklung, deine ausgeglichene Work-Life-Balance und deine Happiness sehr wichtig. Konkret stellen wir mit 32 Urlaubstagen, 60 % mobilem Arbeiten, bis zu 4 Wochen pro Jahr – im europäischen Ausland – der Möglichkeit remote zu arbeiten, Sabbatical und Überstundenausgleich sicher, dass dir im FUSE-Agentur-Leben nichts fehlt.

In unserem derzeit über 60-köpfigen Team sowie unseren Kund*innen haben wir unser perfektes Match bereits gefunden. Wenn du noch auf der Suche bist, bei „popkulturellem Relevanzmarketing“ neugierig wirst und für Social Media, Influencer Marketing oder Gaming & Esports brennst, dann lass uns zusammen loslegen! Denn : Action Creates Impact .

Dein Job

Als (Junior) Insights Analyst (mensch) bearbeitest du als Teil unseres Data und Analytics Teams in erster Linie die Anfragen unserer Kunden nach Social Media Reportings sowie Social Listening Analysen und beherrschst den Spagat zwischen analytischem und kreativem Denken, um die Kolleg:Innen in deinem und anderen Teams mit datenbasierten Insights zu Kundenmeinungen, Märkten, Zielgruppen, Marken und ihren Social Media-Umfeldern zu versorgen.

Dein Aufgabenbereich

Datenbeschaffung / Toolbedienung

Du bist präzise, schnell, zuverlässig und motiviert, wenn es um die manuelle Erfassung großer (Social Media)- Datenmengen geht, aber auch wissbegierig und begeisterungsfähig, dich diesbezüglich kontinuierlich mit Prozessoptimierung zu befassen, sowie dich in Tools und automatisierte Datenerfassungsprozesse und Methoden einzudenken, um immer bessere Lösungen zu finden.

Datenstrukturierung, Effiziente Datensammlung, Query Writing, Kategorisierung und Datendarstellung werden hier deine täglichen Begleiter.

Studiendurchführung

Von der (manchmal noch recht schwammigen) Fragestellung bis zum fertigen Analysebericht mit guten Insights und Handlungsempfehlungen ist es oft ein weiter aber spannender Weg. Der kann bald auch deiner sein, gemeinsam mit uns im Team.

Du hast ein sehr gutes Gespür für Sprache und Kommunikation? Nice, das brauchst du hier in mindestens dreierlei Hinsicht: Erstens, um aus den Aussagen und Briefings unserer Auftraggeber herausfiltern zu können, wie du ihnen am besten weiterhelfen kannst. Zweitens, wenn es darum geht, die Essenz von Konsumenten-Posts und Kommentaren auf Social Media zu verstehen, schließlich ist Inhaltanalyse unser Daily-Business. Und Drittens, um dann Deine Findings Zielgruppengerecht rüberzubringen - in Reports, in Meetings und bei Präsentationen.

Datenanalyse

Auswertungslogiken passend zu den gegebenen Fragestellungen und Erkenntnisinteressen erstellen, Dimensionierungen & Kategorisierungen für Inhaltsanalysen planen und entwickeln, Daten auszählen, filtern, darstellen, vergleichen, interpretieren, daraus kreative Idee und Empfehlungen ableiten. Das ist dein Playground. Deine Affinität zu Zahlen und Daten kannst du hier immer wieder beweisen. Ein stets strukturiertes Vorgehen und ein souveräner Umgang auch mit großen und komplexen Datenmengen, Statistiken und Zahlen sind für dich selbstverständlich.

Spezielle Social Media Analyse-Tools wirst Du ebenso (kennenlernen und) zum Einsatz bringen wie ganz viel Excel und das gute alte Powerpoint.

Das bringst du mit

Du kannst (erste) Erfahrung in der qualitativen und quantitativen Forschungsarbeit, sowie in der marketing- oder kundenorientierten Projektarbeit vorweisen und hast Lust dich im Bereich Social Media Analytics weiter auszutoben. Du hast, dank deines Studiums, einen kommunikations-, sozial- oder medienwissenschaftlichen Background und bringst Kenntnisse der Methoden im Bereich der quantitativen und qualitativen Marktforschung mit. Du hast neben den analytischen Fähigkeiten, auch ein Gespür für gute kreative Kommunikation und Lust, diese mitzuentwickeln. Du bist organisiert und selbständig, willst aber auch noch ständig ganz viel lernen und verstehst dich als Teamplayer, der immer auf Höhe des Zeitgeists ist und daraus neue Impulse für unsere Teams und Kunden ableitet. Außerdem hast Du sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse in Wort und Schrift, sehr gute MS Office Kenntnisse, insbesondere Excel und PowerPoint und bist im besten Fall mit Analytics Tools im Bereich Social Listening & Web Analytics vertraut.

Darum wir

Als Teil der FUSE erfährst du stets Rückenwind von deinem Team, arbeitest für Kunden - die unsere Werte „BOLD. TRUE. EASY. TOGETHER.“ leben und kannst aktiv Prozesse und Strukturen mitentwickeln. Denn ganz getreu unserem Wert TOGETHER setzen wir auf das Potential im Team. Neben unvergesslichen Events bieten wir dir viel Raum für persönliche und berufliche Weiterentwicklung.

Experience in environments with cross-device user behavior (web and app), and understanding of tracking complexities across platforms
Excellent communication and storytelling skills, able to distill complex analyses into simple, impactful narratives

Information about the position

As a Decision Scientist at Vinted, your work will have a tangible impact on the real world, empowering Vinted’s members to lead more sustainable lives. You will play a key role in shaping our product and business strategy by leveraging data to drive impactful decision-making.

Test and analyse developed opportunities to validate their value and understand their business impact, using statistical methods and visualisation tools
Select, calculate, and monitor your team's key performance indicators, proactively flagging issues, running analyses and understanding root causes
Enable your team and direct stakeholders to independently leverage data for business insights via self-service dashboards
Contribute to a data-driven culture by promoting best practices in analytics and decision-making to make data count.


About You


Experience in a Decision Science or Data Analytics role.

Knowledge of statistical methods, such as A/B testing, regression analysis, and other inferential techniques.
Highly results-oriented and comfortable with iterative processes

Information about the position

As a Decision Scientist at Vinted, your work will have a tangible impact on the real world, empowering Vinted’s members to lead more sustainable lives. You will play a key role in shaping our product and business strategy by leveraging data to drive impactful decision-making.

Decision Scientists are responsible for actionable insights, identifying and sizing opportunities, and developing automated tools that increase the quality of product and business decisions by applying statistical methods and data-driven decision-making.

Data Scientists are responsible for identification of algorithmic opportunities, ensuring those opportunities are addressed in an optimal fashion and design, development and maintenance of production-grade statistical and machine learning algorithms.

Analytics Engineers are responsible for data curation – translating data needs from stakeholders into architecting, building and maintaining efficient & reliable data models and pipelines.

As a Decision Scientist at Vinted, you’ll:


Partner with your team and stakeholders at Vinted, to identify strategic opportunities and provide data-driven recommendations, as well as answer critical business questions.
Test and analyse developed opportunities to validate their value and understand their business impact, using statistical methods and visualisation tools
Select, calculate, and monitor your team's key performance indicators, proactively flagging issues, running analyses and understanding root causes
Enable your team and direct stakeholders to independently leverage data for business insights via self-service dashboards
Contribute to a data-driven culture by promoting best practices in analytics and decision-making to make data count.


About You


Experience in a Decision Science or Data Analytics role.

Simple Pharma's purpose is to be the best home for proven pharma products.

We hold marketing authorisations and comply with all regulatory requirements to maintain the highest possible standard of quality and patient safety. And we do this across Europe with the aspiration to expand globally.

Founded in 2019, as part of the Tithonia Group, we have scaled our operations to manage close to 100,000 units per month and 60 marketing authorisations across 25 countries. Our diverse and combined team has more than 30 people across 7 countries, speaking more than 10 languages. We are EBITDA profitable, growing, and are participating in a market that is ripe for new thinking.

At Simple Pharma, our core values— Knowledge and Transparency, Agency, First Principle Thinking & Humility—guide our actions every day. They shape our daily operations and interactions. Whether it's empowering a colleague with the right information, proactively addressing challenges, or embracing feedback, we live these values every day to ensure that Simple Pharma is a place where innovation thrives, and excellence is the norm.

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

Present findings to senior stakeholders, including finance and country managers

What They're Looking For

SQL is essential - window functions, joins, aggregations for the mid-level role

Strong business acumen and commercial thinking

Experience in customer/marketing analytics or a real desire to develop in that space

Bonus: Power BI, Python, exposure to presenting insights to non-technical audiences

Personality and mindset matter - curiosity, drive, and a collaborative approach are key

Salary: Up to £50,000 plus generous package




Location: London, Hybrid (3 days per week onsite)




Position: Permanent







I'm partnered with an ambitious and fast-growing wealth management group, backed by private equity and actively expanding through strategic acquisitions. This is a business that combines the agility of a scale-up with the backing and stability of a well-capitalised, established firm. Their modular approach to wealth services has positioned them as a major disruptor in the UK financial services space.




As part of this transformation journey, they are looking to bring on a Data Analyst - a key strategic and operational role reporting into the CTO. This role sits at the heart of technology operations and is instrumental in shaping how data is used to drive decisions, monitor performance, and deliver operational excellence across the technology function.




This isn’t a traditional back-office data role. You’ll act as the connective tissue between the CTO, Finance, Delivery, and other leadership teams, helping to ensure that data is consistently driving smarter decisions and strategic alignment.




What You’ll Be Doing:

Designing and maintaining executive dashboards that provide visibility into financials, supplier performance, risk, delivery metrics, and workforce analytics
Leading budget tracking, cost control, and forecasting within the technology function
Managing vendor data, including contract renewals, reviews, and supplier KPIs
Monitoring and reporting on operational and technology risks, security vulnerabilities, and audit items
Aggregating Agile delivery metrics and reporting progress against forecasted business benefits
Supporting governance and prioritisation processes with high-quality data and analysis
Acting as a liaison across key stakeholders, ensuring alignment and structured decision-making
Identifying and driving improvements across operational workflows




Skills and Qualifications:

Experience in a technology operations, business management, or data-driven strategy role
Financial experience across budgeting, variance analysis, and cost tracking; ideally with an accounting qualification (CIMA, ACCA, ACA) or equivalent experience
Excellent proficiency with data analytics tools - particularly Power BI and Excel
Deep understanding of IT operations, supplier management, and risk frameworks
Familiarity with Agile delivery principles and project performance tracking
Confident communicator, comfortable working with senior stakeholders and across departments
Ability to turn complex data into clear, actionable insight




Perks (to name a few):

Attractive employee pension scheme
25 days annual leave + public holidays + office Christmas close (3 days)
Buy and sell holidays up to 5 days
Private medical insurance, group life insurance, and income protection insurance
Discretionary performance-related bonus




This is a rare opportunity to join a business in high-growth mode, where you’ll be empowered to shape how data drives performance and technology strategy from the inside out. If this sounds like your kind of challenge, don't hesitate to apply!

Contract: Permanent, Full-time (36 hours per week)

Salary: £37,007 - £38,821 (inclusive of London Weighting)

Benefits: 28 days holiday plus public holidays, Local Government Pension Scheme, Cycle to Work scheme, Employee Assistance Programme

About Us – West London Waste Authority (WLWA)

WLWA is a statutory public body responsible for managing waste disposal for six London boroughs: Brent, Ealing, Harrow, Hillingdon, Hounslow and Richmond upon Thames. Working on behalf of over 1.7 million residents, we manage the treatment, transfer and disposal of waste and recycling that local councils collect.

We coordinate complex waste operations, liaise with multiple contractors and public sector partners, and deliver environmental services with a focus on efficiency and sustainability. As the sector becomes more data-driven, we are investing in the way we collect, manage and use information across borough boundaries.

Make Public Sector Data Work Better Across Borough Boundaries

To support this transformation, we're looking for a Data & Business Intelligence Analyst (internally known as “MI Analyst”) who can work confidently at the intersection of data, systems and people.

This role is for someone who can build robust, insightful reports — while also working collaboratively across boroughs, finance teams and contractors to align data capture and reporting.

This is a delivery-focused position with the opportunity to shape how information flows between organisations and influences operational, financial and environmental decision-making.

What You'll Do


Design, build and maintain automated dashboards and reporting tools using Power BI, DAX, Power Query, and SQL
Gather, validate and integrate data from boroughs and contractors, ensuring consistency and quality
Support statutory data returns (e.g. Waste Data Flow) and produce management and financial reports
Investigate discrepancies, spot data issues early, and engage constructively with partners to resolve them
Collaborate closely with internal colleagues and external stakeholders to deliver improvements in reporting accuracy, usability and efficiency
Provide mentoring and task oversight to the MI Assistant to ensure consistent data practices across the team.


The Environment You'll Be Working In

This role spans multiple organisations with differing systems and priorities. It requires a proactive, analytical approach — and the ability to build trust and shared understanding across stakeholders.


You'll need to communicate clearly, work interactively with others, and respond effectively to requests and issues as they arise.
The role involves real-time collaboration and engagement as part of day-to-day delivery, especially when resolving data queries or aligning reporting practices.


Essential Skills And Experience


Proven experience using Power BI, including DAX, Power Query, and data modelling techniques
Strong skills in SQL or T-SQL for transforming, cleansing and integrating data
Experience working with large, complex datasets from multiple sources
Ability to identify, explain and resolve data issues through direct engagement with stakeholders
Evidence you can drive a data issue to resolution – e.g. persuading a partner to correct their feed, coaching non-technical colleagues, or thrashing it out on a live call until the numbers balance.
Experience working in a setting where cross-organisational collaboration or partner engagement was key to delivery


Highly Desirable Experience working in or with local government or public sector data.


Understanding of environmental or waste management data
Familiarity with statutory data submission processes or financial reconciliation reporting
Hands-on data-engineering capability, ideally including: Designing and building a lakehouse architecture, Implementing Azure access-management controls, Setting up row-level security for Power BI reports


Why Join WLWA?

We're a small, mission-driven organisation with wide reach and big ambitions. You'll work in a role that combines technical hands-on data work with the chance to improve public services across six London boroughs.

We Offer


28 days annual leave plus public holidays
Membership of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS)
Opportunities to lead on meaningful improvements in data processes and reporting
A varied, cross-organisational working environment with real-world impact

The Company

Imagine a world where every small business has the power to thrive. That's the world we're building at iwoca. Small businesses aren't just statistics – they're the heartbeat of our communities, the character of our high streets, and the engine of our economy. Since 2012, we've revolutionised how these businesses access finance, turning what was once a lengthy, frustrating process into something remarkable: funding that's fast, flexible, and actually works for modern businesses.

Our impact speaks for itself: we've provided billions in funding to over 150,000 businesses across Europe, making us one of the continent's leading fintech innovators. But we're just getting started. Our mission? To empower one million businesses with the financial tools they deserve.

We combine cutting-edge technology and data science with genuine human understanding to make finance feel less like a barrier and more like a superpower. Whether it's managing cash flow or seizing unexpected opportunities, we ensure businesses get the funds they need – often within minutes.

As we deepen our relationship with customers, insurance feels like a natural next step: it's a critical piece of the financial puzzle for small businesses, and one that's often underserved. We're bringing the same customer obsession, data-driven approach, and innovative mindset to the world of SME insurance - starting from first principles to build something that really works for modern businesses.

Your mission

You’ll be one of the first data analysts shaping our insurance venture from the ground up. Your mission? Dig into our treasure trove of proprietary data and uncover the insights that will guide how we enter the SME insurance market—what we build, who we build it for, and how we make it genuinely useful.

Your analysis won’t sit in a deck gathering dust—you’ll help us make real decisions, from product design to customer targeting and everything in between. Expect variety, challenge, and the chance to leave a real mark.

You’ll report directly to the Head of the Insurance Venture and work closely with product, tech, and marketing to bring your ideas to life.

Key Responsibilities include:


Deliver insight through mining of proprietary and public data: Use transactional, behavioural, and market data to identify trends and opportunities. Create clear reports and dashboards (using tools like Looker, Tableau, or Excel) to support decision-making and shape product direction.
Make tangible product and marketing strategy recommendations: Collaborate with Product and Marketing to develop data-led strategies that optimise features, customer journeys, and overall performance. Analyse customer behaviour to identify usage patterns and recommend improvements.
Recommend adjustments to strategy by monitoring performance and running experiments: Develop and track key KPIs, identify drivers of success or underperformance, and support A/B testing to validate ideas and optimise the insurance product.
Collaborate across teams: Work closely with Product, Tech, and Marketing to ensure data is embedded in product development and campaign execution.


The Requirements

Essential:


3+ years experience in product/marketing analytics, data analysis or insight roles in tech-driven environments.
Proficiency in SQL and Excel/Google Sheets – these are foundational for querying and manipulating data.
Strong business acumen – ability to align data work with product and commercial goals.
Stakeholder communication skills – proven ability to explain complex insights to non-technical teams.
Structured problem-solving and comfort with ambiguity - especially within data.
Experience working with product and/or marketing teams, supporting experiments or product launches.
Familiarity with tools like Looker, Tableau, Google Analytics.
Degree in a numerically-focused degree, such as Statistics, Mathematics, Economics or equivalent.


Bonus:


Experience in insurance, especially SME insurance or embedded insurance products.

          <strong>We’re looking for a Data Analyst (Insurance)<br><br></strong><strong>The Company<br><br></strong>Imagine a world where every small business has the power to thrive. That's the world we're building at iwoca. Small businesses aren't just statistics – they're the heartbeat of our communities, the character of our high streets, and the engine of our economy. Since 2012, we've revolutionised how these businesses access finance, turning what was once a lengthy, frustrating process into something remarkable: funding that's fast, flexible, and actually works for modern businesses.<br><br>Our impact speaks for itself: we've provided billions in funding to over 150,000 businesses across Europe, making us one of the continent's leading fintech innovators. But we're just getting started. Our mission? To empower one million businesses with the financial tools they deserve.<br><br>We combine cutting-edge technology and data science with genuine human understanding to make finance feel less like a barrier and more like a superpower. Whether it's managing cash flow or seizing unexpected opportunities, we ensure businesses get the funds they need – often within minutes.<br><br>As we deepen our relationship with customers, insurance feels like a natural next step: it's a critical piece of the financial puzzle for small businesses, and one that's often underserved. We're bringing the same customer obsession, data-driven approach, and innovative mindset to the world of SME insurance - starting from first principles to build something that really works for modern businesses.<br><br><strong>Your mission<br><br></strong>You’ll be one of the first data analysts shaping our insurance venture from the ground up. Your mission? Dig into our treasure trove of proprietary data and uncover the insights that will guide how we enter the SME insurance market—what we build, who we build it for, and how we make it genuinely useful.<br><br>Your analysis won’t sit in a deck gathering dust—you’ll help us make real decisions, from product design to customer targeting and everything in between.

Create clear reports and dashboards (using tools like Looker, Tableau, or Excel) to support decision-making and shape product direction.</li><li>Make tangible product and marketing strategy recommendations: Collaborate with Product and Marketing to develop data-led strategies that optimise features, customer journeys, and overall performance. Analyse customer behaviour to identify usage patterns and recommend improvements.</li><li>Recommend adjustments to strategy by monitoring performance and running experiments: Develop and track key KPIs, identify drivers of success or underperformance, and support A/B testing to validate ideas and optimise the insurance product.</li><li>Collaborate across teams: Work closely with Product, Tech, and Marketing to ensure data is embedded in product development and campaign execution.<br><br></li></ul><strong>The Requirements<br><br></strong>Essential:<br><br><ul><li>3+ years experience in product/marketing analytics, data analysis or insight roles in tech-driven environments.</li><li>Proficiency in SQL and Excel/Google Sheets – these are foundational for querying and manipulating data.</li><li>Strong business acumen – ability to align data work with product and commercial goals.</li><li>Stakeholder communication skills – proven ability to explain complex insights to non-technical teams.</li><li>Structured problem-solving and comfort with ambiguity - especially within data.</li><li>Experience working with product and/or marketing teams, supporting experiments or product launches.</li><li>Familiarity with tools like Looker, Tableau, Google Analytics.</li><li>Degree in a numerically-focused degree, such as Statistics, Mathematics, Economics or equivalent.<br><br></li></ul>Bonus:<br><br><ul><li>Experience in insurance, especially SME insurance or embedded insurance products.</li><li>Hands-on experience with A/B testing and experimentation frameworks.</li><li>Exposure to customer segmentation, journey mapping, or product lifecycle analytics.</li><li>Previous involvement in market entry initiatives or greenfield product launches.</li><li>Proficiency in using Python software for advanced data analysis. <br><br></li></ul><strong>The salary<br><br></strong>We expect to pay from £50,000 - £65,000 plus equity options for this role.

Strong business acumen and commercial thinking

Experience in customer/marketing analytics or a real desire to develop in that space

Bonus: Power BI, Python, exposure to presenting insights to non-technical audiences

Personality and mindset matter - curiosity, drive, and a collaborative approach are key

Salary: Up to £50,000 plus generous package




Location: London, Hybrid (3 days per week onsite)




Position: Permanent







I'm partnered with an ambitious and fast-growing wealth management group, backed by private equity and actively expanding through strategic acquisitions. This is a business that combines the agility of a scale-up with the backing and stability of a well-capitalised, established firm. Their modular approach to wealth services has positioned them as a major disruptor in the UK financial services space.




As part of this transformation journey, they are looking to bring on a Data Analyst - a key strategic and operational role reporting into the CTO. This role sits at the heart of technology operations and is instrumental in shaping how data is used to drive decisions, monitor performance, and deliver operational excellence across the technology function.




This isn’t a traditional back-office data role. You’ll act as the connective tissue between the CTO, Finance, Delivery, and other leadership teams, helping to ensure that data is consistently driving smarter decisions and strategic alignment.




What You’ll Be Doing:

Designing and maintaining executive dashboards that provide visibility into financials, supplier performance, risk, delivery metrics, and workforce analytics
Leading budget tracking, cost control, and forecasting within the technology function
Managing vendor data, including contract renewals, reviews, and supplier KPIs
Monitoring and reporting on operational and technology risks, security vulnerabilities, and audit items
Aggregating Agile delivery metrics and reporting progress against forecasted business benefits
Supporting governance and prioritisation processes with high-quality data and analysis
Acting as a liaison across key stakeholders, ensuring alignment and structured decision-making
Identifying and driving improvements across operational workflows




Skills and Qualifications:

Experience in a technology operations, business management, or data-driven strategy role
Financial experience across budgeting, variance analysis, and cost tracking; ideally with an accounting qualification (CIMA, ACCA, ACA) or equivalent experience
Excellent proficiency with data analytics tools - particularly Power BI and Excel
Deep understanding of IT operations, supplier management, and risk frameworks
Familiarity with Agile delivery principles and project performance tracking
Confident communicator, comfortable working with senior stakeholders and across departments
Ability to turn complex data into clear, actionable insight




Perks (to name a few):

Attractive employee pension scheme
25 days annual leave + public holidays + office Christmas close (3 days)
Buy and sell holidays up to 5 days
Private medical insurance, group life insurance, and income protection insurance
Discretionary performance-related bonus




This is a rare opportunity to join a business in high-growth mode, where you’ll be empowered to shape how data drives performance and technology strategy from the inside out. If this sounds like your kind of challenge, don't hesitate to apply!

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together.

You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Be a key owner of data quality, building out insights that serve the data team itself to help guide our data efforts towards cleaner and richer data.
Compose pipelines by writing SQL code to clean, combine, refine, and aggregate data into the insights the organization needs.
Collaborating on new datasets to ingest into our Snowflake data warehouse, working closely with data engineers on your team.
Not afraid of pushing code that supports tens of billions of dollars in daily transaction volume.


About You

We are looking for someone with previous data analyst experience. Likely with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Physics or related field, but we also consider and highly value equivalent practical experience.

Required


Strong SQL knowledge and experience
Proven track record in data modeling, statistics, and analytics
Experience working with a broad range of stakeholders
Strong convictions weakly held.
You enjoy working in a fast-paced start-up environment, where you'll need to take initiative and solve problems independently.
You understand the importance of data quality through incremental data development.


Bonus


Experience with general programming, we use Python and Go on the data stack
Experience with Snowflake
Experience building DAG based data pipelines
Experience with streaming real-time data pipelines

Compensation Expectations For The Role

Jane’s committed to paying our team members fairly, clearly, and above all, paying for growth. This role has a minimum annual salary of $97,600 and maximum annual salary of $152,400. As you may have noticed, this salary range is quite large, and this is intentional to account for the growth someone will experience in the role throughout their time at Jane (i.e., from building the skills, to accomplished, to highly proficient, all the way to achieving excellence in the role). When hiring talented folks to join the Jane team, we’ve found that new team members are best set up for success when hired with the expectation of being fully accomplished in the role, which for this role would reflect a starting salary of $115,900.

It's also possible to join Jane at a salary above or below this, which would mean a salary below $115,900 typically reflects someone who has all the potential to be fully accomplished in the role but doesn't yet possess all the skills required, while a salary above $115,900 is typically for individuals who are currently in this role at Jane and had the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on our customers, product and company with deep Jane knowledge. At Jane, we pay for growth, which means that you’ll continue to have conversations about your career development with your manager and see your compensation grow over time as you build an amazing career with us.

Paying clearly is one of our compensation fundamentals to help folks build trust in the compensation process at Jane. To better understand Jane’s compensation fundamentals and how this range is determined, click on this link here for a short video walkthrough of how it all works! We also welcome you to ask as many questions as you’d like about compensation throughout the interview process to ensure you feel confident and build trust through the process.

At Jane, we’re committed to fostering an environment that allows you to come to work as your truest self. We believe it’s important to actively recognize, embrace, and celebrate our differences in order to make Jane an inclusive, equitable, and diverse workplace.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources
Define and monitor key economic impact metrics
Go deep on understanding business drivers, user segments, cohorts and macroeconomic trends
Prepare presentations, analyses and visualizations for internal and external executive audiences
Partner closely with Communications, Policy, Marketing and Product teams to identify and analyze key trends and produce thought leadership pieces and campaign content leveraging Stripe data
Collaborate with external vendors, academics, and think tanks to advance Stripe’s research agenda and advocacy positions



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.
