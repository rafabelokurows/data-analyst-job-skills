About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Payment Intelligence Engineering’s purpose is to mitigate threats to our systems in order to keep our merchants, Stripe and financial partners safe. We empower global businesses with intelligent solutions for conversion and fraud prevention, leveraging consumer intelligence and transparent ML to maximize growth and build trust. Our Payments Intelligence portfolio delivers actionable insights to all user segments.

The Payments Health Technical Operations team is pioneering new ways to achieve this mission. Our dynamic team relies on the expertise of integration reliability engineers and data analysts to identify gaps and build comprehensive solutions in the ever changing arena of fraud prevention.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and maintain SQL queries to analyze and navigate complex financial data effectively.
Enhance overall observability by identifying gaps and proposing actionable insights to improve our monitoring systems.
Actively hunt for patterns and anomalies in data that could indicate potential threats or operational issues.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to consolidate and gather relevant data for informed engineering efforts.
Design and implement comprehensive dashboards for real-time visibility into key metrics and system health.
Establish and refine key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress and improvements over time.
Support the creation and maintenance of observability frameworks to ensure early detection of issues.
Contribute to efforts that reduce organizational toil by optimizing data analysis processes.
Communicate findings and insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Stay updated with industry trends in data analysis and financial data handling to ensure best practices.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have 5+ years of experience in Payments at a leading technology or payments company
Have experience writing SQL to query relational databases
Have experience managing communications and workflows with technical and non-technical teams across internal and external stakeholders
Experience mentoring junior team members in technical skill development, operational strategy and problem solving
Have experience navigating the nuanced complexity of financial systems and solving large scale, technical challenges
Have strong financial modeling and analytical skills to investigate, prioritize, and identify the root cause of issues
Have experience managing multiple, concurrent work streams, identifying and triaging technical issues and driving solutions with clear metrics to show impact



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,400 - $219,600. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Collaborate closely with quant researchers, PMs, and risk managers to understand how data is consumed and enhance its usability
Ensure data quality, lineage, and availability across the firm's analytical infrastructure
Contribute to broader data modernization efforts across risk and research teams

Ideal Candidate:

3-7 years of experience in a data-driven role supporting front-office or research teams at a hedge fund, asset manager, or proprietary trading firm
Strong programming skills (Python preferred); experience with modern data tooling and pipeline design
Familiarity with financial market data, portfolio data, or risk data
Able to operate with autonomy in a lean, high-performance team
Strategic thinker who enjoys building from the ground up and partnering with stakeholders across quant, tech, and risk

Abridge was founded in 2018 with the mission of powering deeper understanding in healthcare. Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.

Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.

We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense. We have offices located in the SoHo neighborhood of New York, the Mission District in San Francisco, and Lawrenceville in Pittsburgh.

The Role

Our generative AI-powered products are revolutionizing the practice of medicine, and we’re looking for a highly motivated Senior Data Analyst to join our growing US-based Data Science & BI team. Your work will be instrumental in driving product strategy, directly influencing how healthcare professionals engage with patient data.

What You'll Do

Data Analysis and Insight Generation


Extract meaningful insights and identify trends and patterns relevant to our business and product, by collecting, cleaning, and analyzing internal and external data
Ensure end-to-end visibility and understanding of our AI generation pipelines, from internal quality metrics to automated assessment in production.
Investigate and correct issues identified through data operations monitors, tools, and reports.


Cross-Functional Leadership and Collaboration


Effectively communicate trends and patterns to internal and external stakeholders, by developing and maintaining live dashboards
Serve as a domain expert for the business context of our analytics data, sharing your understanding of the assumptions and limitations of our business metrics.
Continually enhance our understanding of the business and product, by identifying and filling gaps in our data sources. This includes working closely with multidisciplinary teams such as product, engineering, partner success, and the executive team.


Who You Are


8+ years of experience in Data Analytics, BI or a related field, ideally at a product-focused software company.
Expert-level SQL skills with proficiency in writing efficient queries on large and complex data sets.
Understanding of database technology and experience with a cloud SQL data warehouse (e.g. BigQuery, Postgres, Snowflake)
Experience in analytical data modeling and schema design
Experience with a data visualization tool (e.g. Tableau, Looker, Sigma)


Data Advocate


Excellent communicator capable of effectively delivering quantitative findings to non-technical stakeholders in a clear and compelling fashion.
A team player, comfortable assisting others across the organization in solving data problems and answering questions with data
Passionate about data quality, with a keen interest in data drill down and problem-solving
Ability to prioritize amidst changing priorities in a fast moving environment


Domain-relevant Knowledge


Knowledge of healthcare settings, electronic health records (EHR), and healthcare billing are all a plus
Experience with common approaches to measure and drive user engagement is a plus


Base Salary: $153,000 USD - $189,000 USD per year + Equity

The salary range provided is based on transparent pay guidelines and is an estimate for candidates residing in the San Francisco Bay area. The actual base salary will vary depending on the candidate's location, relevant experience, skills, qualifications, and other job-related factors. Additionally, this role may include the opportunity to participate in a company stock option plan as part of the total compensation package.

Must be willing to work from our SF office at least 3x per week

This position requires a commitment to a hybrid work model, with the expectation of coming into the office a minimum of (3) three times per week. Relocation assistance is available for candidates willing to move to San Francisco.

We value people who are eager to learn new things and recognize that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.

Why work at Abridge?

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

How we take care of Abridgers:


Generous Time Off: 13 paid holidays, flexible PTO for salaried employees, and accrued time off for hourly employees.
Comprehensive Health Plans: Medical, Dental, and Vision plans for all full-time employees. Abridge covers 100% of the premium for you and 75% for dependents. If you choose a HSA-eligible plan, Abridge also makes monthly contributions to your HSA.
Paid Parental Leave: 16 weeks paid parental leave for all full-time employees.
401k and Matching: Contribution matching to help invest in your future.
Pre-tax Benefits: Access to Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) and Commuter Benefits.
Learning and Development Budget: Yearly contributions for coaching, courses, workshops, conferences, and more.
Sabbatical Leave: 30 days of paid Sabbatical Leave after 5 years of employment.
Compensation and Equity: Competitive compensation and equity grants for full time employees.
... and much more!


Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying safe - Protect yourself from recruitment fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process.

World is a network of real humans, built on privacy-preserving proof-of-human technology, and powered by a globally inclusive financial network that enables the free flow of digital assets for all. It is built to connect, empower, and be owned by everyone.

About the team:

The Data Science team is responsible for providing business intelligence services to the whole project and for deriving data-driven insights to support World’s key decisions. Because of our unique growth model of using a global network of Orb Operators to verify individuals’ unique humanness, we require a high-performing Data Science team that is able to manage and analyze large amounts of data generated by our products and operations.

About You:


Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field like economics, computer science, statistics, or similar

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Want to make an impact? Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.




We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.




Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, we work closely with our teams in Barcelona, San Antonio, Spokane, and remote locations. We’ve got a reputation for being a great place to work, having been named among the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Seattle Business Magazine and Washington’s Best Workplaces in the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies.




At Rover, our furry coworkers are just as important as our human ones—and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Along with making the joys of pet parenthood more accessible, we’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community of pet people—and that starts with our employees.




Who we're looking for:

The Marketing Analytics team supports the company’s marketing efforts, while also working with teams throughout the organization. The analytics team is responsible for a number of business-critical reports and data models that our global marketing teams rely on for daily reporting, budgeting, and analysis. We measure marketing attribution to understand how people become Rover customers, provide campaign reporting to monitor trends in cost efficiency and optimization, deliver lifecycle data to action against a variety of customer behaviors, and narrate the business to identify and prioritize new opportunities.




We are looking for an Analyst to support our Growth, International Expansion, Lifecycle, and SEO stakeholders with a focus on improving our reporting and dashboard structure. The ideal candidate will have experience working closely with business stakeholders and building data-driven narratives that enable clear decision making.




Your Responsibilities:

Work closely with analytics peers and marketing teams to narrate trends and insights, with a particular focus on our customer acquisition marketing programs.
Design reports and dashboards that enable clear, data-driven decision-making for marketing and cross-functional teams.
Refine our marketing attribution models to drive optimal resource allocation across paid and organic marketing channels.
Expand your expertise by supporting experiments such as A/B testing and Market Match tests to optimize strategies across multiple marketing functions.




Your Qualifications:

At least 2 years experience working with complex datasets to support business decision making.
Fluency in SQL.
Data visualisation tool experience (e.g. Mode, Looker, Tableau, etc.)
Ability to adapt your communication style to translate complex data insights for different audiences.
You have experience in owning small-to-medium projects from design to completion with limited guidance from your manager.
You understand when you are blocked, proactively seeking out for help within the team or the organization to move the project forward.




Nice to Have:

Python or R familiarity is helpful, but we welcome candidates eager to develop these skills.
Experience evaluating results of A/B tests as well as expertise in statistical analysis.
Understanding of marketing metrics such as clicks, CPC, CTR, impressions, and unit economics like customer LTV, payback period, and CAC.




Benefits of working at Rover:

Competitive compensation
Long-term incentive plan with a company performance-based cash payout
Permanent contract
Pension Plan
Meal tickets through Cobee
Generous PTO Allowance
Hybrid schedule
Private health insurance
Discounted Gym Membership
Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time)
Monetary help for adopting a dog plus yearly credit to use on our platform
Flexible work hours, sometimes you’ll need to be in at certain times, but on the whole, we’re pretty flexible when it comes to managing workload and time
Grab snacks, fresh fruit, in our kitchen to keep yourself going
Regular team activities, including happy hours, game nights, and more

Vous avez la capacité à transformer un océan de chiffres en informations stratégiques précieuses pour l’entreprise ? À l’aise avec les statistiques et les bases de données, vous décelez les tendances et les comportements clients ? Vous aimez analyser et visualiser des données complexes ? Ce métier vous place au cœur des décisions stratégiques avec une analyse précise des données récoltées.

Parce que chaque donnée compte pour optimiser sa stratégie, Arte France Développement, filiale d’Arte France, recrute un data analyst pour soutenir la croissance de l’activité Vidéo à la Demande (VOD) liée à la plateforme Arte Boutique et à la distribution des contenus de son catalogue auprès des plateformes partenaires.




Vous aurez comme mission :




Analyse Data :

Analyser des ensembles de données pour identifier les tendances et les modèles pertinents pour nourrir notre dynamique de croissance
Effectuer des analyses statistiques pour valider des résultats
Proposer des recommandations basées sur les résultats d’analyse
Elaborer des rapports et des tableaux de bord pour communiquer les résultats aux équipes
Assurer la qualité des données en réalisant des vérifications régulières

Veille technologique et suivi de l’activité :

Faire de la veille technologique des nouveaux outils visant à l’améliorer l’analyse des données
Mettre en œuvre et exploiter des technologies pour automatiser la collecte et l’analyse de données
Concevoir et exécuter des expériences pour tester des hypothèses

Coordination :

Travailler en étroite collaboration avec les équipes marketing, commercial et éditorial pour identifier leurs besoins et répondre à leurs questions stratégiques




Profil recherché




Parce que le rôle de Data Analyst est clé dans notre développement, nous recherchons les compétences suivantes :

compréhension approfondie des concepts statistiques et des méthodes d’analyse
capacité à communiquer efficacement des résultats à des non-spécialistes
compétences en visualisation des données
maîtrise des outils d’analyse de données, tels que SQL, R ou Python
aptitude à résoudre des problèmes complexes en utilisant des données
attention aux détails pour garantir l’exactitude des analyses
compétences en gestion de projet pour gérer des échéances et des priorités
capacité à travailler de manière autonome et en équipe




Parce qu’on aime bien les petits plus :

Le cinéma, les documentaires et les séries, ça vous parle ? Parce que vous allez baigner dedans. Autant vous préparer à disserter sur le dernier Ozon ou à imaginer « En thérapie » Saison 3 entre deux régressions statistiques
Do you speak english ? On aime bien aussi la langue de Shakespeare ou de Christopher Nolan, surtout qu’elle peut être très utile pour le poste
Comme on est déjà équipé, la connaissance d’Amplitude vous donnera un petit avantage, mais une customer data platform reste une customer data platform
Questions cursus : master en marketing, master en big data, master en mathématiques ou spécialisation en statistiques nous paraissent un bon début. Si vous avez en plus 3 ans d’expérience minimum dans un poste similaire




Si vous vous reconnaissez dans cette description ? On a très envie de vous rencontrer.




Le groupe ARTE est convaincu que la pluralité des talents et des parcours est une force et s’engage en faveur de la diversité et de l’inclusion.

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have a true love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem and living inside a spreadsheet or data set to find the answer to any question.
You have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization tools, and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis.
Experience with Marketing APIs, BigQuery or other cloud data warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks), ETL tools (such as Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics), and/or Python is a plus.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and at least 1 year of experience working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.

What You’ll Do:




Reporting:

Maintain customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence.
Use Advanced Excel, SQL, and Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools to generate pivot tables and other visualizations summarizing thousands of lines of data.
Translate performance media metrics into clear, digestible reports for client advertising campaigns.
Communicate insights effectively through Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.




Strategy:

Learn our clients’ businesses and align media strategy with their business goals.
Analyze advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to guide media buying strategy.
Apply your background in paid media and/or digital advertising, including understanding concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue.
Engage in discussions with clients to build trust and gain stakeholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.




Gupta Media is an office-first organization.

Location: Boston, Massachusetts (Hybrid)

Also known as: Research Analyst, Data Analyst (Entry-Level), Political Research Associate




About the Position

We have an immediate opening for a full-time Junior Analyst at Beacon Research. Junior Analysts are engaged at every stage of the polling process—assisting principals and senior staff in survey design, data analysis, and results reporting—as well as supporting qualitative research such as focus groups.




Our Junior Analysts are more than just support staff—they are key contributors to the integrity and impact of our work. You will serve as the first line of quality control, ensuring that every topline, crosstab, and presentation reflects our firm’s commitment to excellence. Our clients depend on us for strategic advice to advance their goals; we have a firm-wide commitment to ensuring that advice is based on the highest-quality data.




Our team is small and tight-knit, which means Junior Analysts interact closely with senior research staff, the firm’s partners, and clients (as appropriate). This role has ample growth opportunities and a support infrastructure to guide you along the way. Recent Junior Analysts have been promoted to higher positions in the company.




We are an equal opportunity employer and consider all applicants, regardless of race/ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, age, and veteran status. Women, people of color, and others from groups underrepresented in politics/political consulting are strongly encouraged to apply.




Primary Responsibilities Include:

Assisting in survey development, design, and fielding (including testing survey programming and/or programming).
Drafting and editing research reports, which includes data entry and visualization (graphs, tables, charts), building reports for presentations, and drafting/editing memos.
Proofing questionnaires, discussion guides, surveys, data tables, memos, and presentations (for typos and data errors and, as you gain experience, quality of substance/content).
Using Python or R to automate topline/chart production, and streamline analysis processes.
Collaborating with senior staff on experiments with AI systems, including building and customizing GPTs.
Exploring opportunities for workflow automation, particularly in areas like data entry, chart generation, and quality control.




Key Skills and Qualifications

Successful applicants will:

Have a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent experience) in a relevant field. If your experience is a bit outside the box, that’s fine—convince us it’s relevant!
Demonstrate relentless attention to detail and consistently correct typos or data errors. Easy to say, harder to prove—tell us how you ensure perfection.
Be highly proficient in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Can you use these tools to increase the quality and efficiency of our work?
Have strong verbal, written, and/or visual communication skills and an analytical approach to problem-solving.

Bonus points for those with:

Relevant professional experience, particularly in polling, public opinion research, market research, marketing, public relations, political campaigns, etc.
An understanding of quantitative and qualitative research methods and techniques.
Experience in data analysis or online survey research, including survey programming.
Ability to use Python, R, or SPSS to automate recurring tasks, format datasets, or analyze survey results.
Comfort with AI systems like ChatGPT, with an interest in using generative tools to enhance research workflows.
Experience with database creation or management, or interest in helping us build a structured archive of past research.
A proactive approach to solving problems and a willingness to work both independently and collaboratively.
Demonstrable interest in politics and an aptitude for strategic political thinking.




Location & Schedule

Strong preference for candidates located in the Boston area. We average 2 days a week working in our Boston office and the remainder remote, with the expectation of in-person–like responsiveness during business hours.




Salary & Benefits

The salary range for this position is $50,000–$60,000 annually, depending on experience. Team members are also eligible for performance-based bonuses awarded twice annually. Beacon offers an attractive benefits package, including highly competitive compensation, generous paid time off (including half-day summer Fridays), 100% employer-paid health and dental insurance, 401(k) matching, and more.

Please send your resume and cover letter to careers@beaconresearch.com. Applications will be accepted through June 1, 2025. No phone calls, please.
