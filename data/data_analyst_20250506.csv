About Us

Baobab's mission is to protect SMEs against cyber attacks better.

We rethink Cyber protection for SMEs by integrating Cyber Insurance with preventive cyber security services.

Like the Baobab tree, Baobab stands for security and support in all circumstances. We help our partners, as well as customers, to better understand cyber (risks). We not only focus on remediation after an incident but also reduce the likelihood of such an event.

We are supported by renowned investors such as Project A, and La Famiglia. In Zurich Insurance, we also have a solid partner with whom we have made a dynamic start as a risk carrier in the market.

Why is cyber insurance important for SMEs? Regardless of size, every business has vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit. Just because a company is small doesn't mean it can't be a target of a cyber-attack. The cyber sector is so fast-moving that there is always a residual risk here, which should then be insured.

We believe that diversity in the team makes the company stronger. We do not discriminate on the basis of religion, skin color, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, or disability and welcome applications from all backgrounds. Apply now to become part of our team!

Getreu unserem Motto – People is what makes us us – sind uns deine nachhaltige Ausbildung und Weiterentwicklung, deine ausgeglichene Work-Life-Balance und deine Happiness sehr wichtig. Konkret stellen wir mit 32 Urlaubstagen, 60 % mobilem Arbeiten, bis zu 4 Wochen pro Jahr – im europäischen Ausland – der Möglichkeit remote zu arbeiten, Sabbatical und Überstundenausgleich sicher, dass dir im FUSE-Agentur-Leben nichts fehlt.

In unserem derzeit über 60-köpfigen Team sowie unseren Kund*innen haben wir unser perfektes Match bereits gefunden. Wenn du noch auf der Suche bist, bei „popkulturellem Relevanzmarketing“ neugierig wirst und für Social Media, Influencer Marketing oder Gaming & Esports brennst, dann lass uns zusammen loslegen! Denn : Action Creates Impact .

Dein Job

Als (Junior) Insights Analyst (mensch) bearbeitest du als Teil unseres Data und Analytics Teams in erster Linie die Anfragen unserer Kunden nach Social Media Reportings sowie Social Listening Analysen und beherrschst den Spagat zwischen analytischem und kreativem Denken, um die Kolleg:Innen in deinem und anderen Teams mit datenbasierten Insights zu Kundenmeinungen, Märkten, Zielgruppen, Marken und ihren Social Media-Umfeldern zu versorgen.

Dein Aufgabenbereich

Datenbeschaffung / Toolbedienung

Du bist präzise, schnell, zuverlässig und motiviert, wenn es um die manuelle Erfassung großer (Social Media)- Datenmengen geht, aber auch wissbegierig und begeisterungsfähig, dich diesbezüglich kontinuierlich mit Prozessoptimierung zu befassen, sowie dich in Tools und automatisierte Datenerfassungsprozesse und Methoden einzudenken, um immer bessere Lösungen zu finden.

Datenstrukturierung, Effiziente Datensammlung, Query Writing, Kategorisierung und Datendarstellung werden hier deine täglichen Begleiter.

Studiendurchführung

Von der (manchmal noch recht schwammigen) Fragestellung bis zum fertigen Analysebericht mit guten Insights und Handlungsempfehlungen ist es oft ein weiter aber spannender Weg. Der kann bald auch deiner sein, gemeinsam mit uns im Team.

Du hast ein sehr gutes Gespür für Sprache und Kommunikation? Nice, das brauchst du hier in mindestens dreierlei Hinsicht: Erstens, um aus den Aussagen und Briefings unserer Auftraggeber herausfiltern zu können, wie du ihnen am besten weiterhelfen kannst. Zweitens, wenn es darum geht, die Essenz von Konsumenten-Posts und Kommentaren auf Social Media zu verstehen, schließlich ist Inhaltanalyse unser Daily-Business. Und Drittens, um dann Deine Findings Zielgruppengerecht rüberzubringen - in Reports, in Meetings und bei Präsentationen.

Datenanalyse

Auswertungslogiken passend zu den gegebenen Fragestellungen und Erkenntnisinteressen erstellen, Dimensionierungen & Kategorisierungen für Inhaltsanalysen planen und entwickeln, Daten auszählen, filtern, darstellen, vergleichen, interpretieren, daraus kreative Idee und Empfehlungen ableiten. Das ist dein Playground. Deine Affinität zu Zahlen und Daten kannst du hier immer wieder beweisen. Ein stets strukturiertes Vorgehen und ein souveräner Umgang auch mit großen und komplexen Datenmengen, Statistiken und Zahlen sind für dich selbstverständlich.

Spezielle Social Media Analyse-Tools wirst Du ebenso (kennenlernen und) zum Einsatz bringen wie ganz viel Excel und das gute alte Powerpoint.

Das bringst du mit

Du kannst (erste) Erfahrung in der qualitativen und quantitativen Forschungsarbeit, sowie in der marketing- oder kundenorientierten Projektarbeit vorweisen und hast Lust dich im Bereich Social Media Analytics weiter auszutoben. Du hast, dank deines Studiums, einen kommunikations-, sozial- oder medienwissenschaftlichen Background und bringst Kenntnisse der Methoden im Bereich der quantitativen und qualitativen Marktforschung mit. Du hast neben den analytischen Fähigkeiten, auch ein Gespür für gute kreative Kommunikation und Lust, diese mitzuentwickeln. Du bist organisiert und selbständig, willst aber auch noch ständig ganz viel lernen und verstehst dich als Teamplayer, der immer auf Höhe des Zeitgeists ist und daraus neue Impulse für unsere Teams und Kunden ableitet. Außerdem hast Du sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse in Wort und Schrift, sehr gute MS Office Kenntnisse, insbesondere Excel und PowerPoint und bist im besten Fall mit Analytics Tools im Bereich Social Listening & Web Analytics vertraut.

Darum wir

Als Teil der FUSE erfährst du stets Rückenwind von deinem Team, arbeitest für Kunden - die unsere Werte „BOLD. TRUE. EASY. TOGETHER.“ leben und kannst aktiv Prozesse und Strukturen mitentwickeln. Denn ganz getreu unserem Wert TOGETHER setzen wir auf das Potential im Team. Neben unvergesslichen Events bieten wir dir viel Raum für persönliche und berufliche Weiterentwicklung.

Als Analyst für Healthcare Analytics bist du Teil von Beratungsteams bei Klienten sowie von internen Projekten, Recherchen und Analysen zu Unternehmen und Trends in den europäischen Gesundheitssystemen. Wir sind Teil von McKinseys globalem Client Capability Network (CCN) mit mehr als 7.000 Kolleginnen und Kollegen, die unsere Klienten und Beratungsteams mit Expertise und Branchenanalysen unterstützen. Zur Verstärkung unseres Teams in Deutschland suchen wir dich zum nächstmöglichen Zeitpunkt als Analyst für Healthcare Analytics.

Das Healthcare Analytics Team nutzt Analysen und Daten aus dem Gesundheitswesen (z.B. Krankenversicherungen oder Gesundheitseinrichtungen), um einige der dringendsten Fragen unserer Klienten zu beantworten, wie zum Beispiel „Wie können wir die Kosten der Gesundheitsversorgung optimieren und gleichzeitig die Qualität verbessern?“, „Wie bleiben wir wettbewerbsfähig in der sich wandelnden Gesundheitslandschaft?“, „Wer sind die sensibelsten Patientengruppen und mit welchen Behandlungspfaden können wir ihre Versorgung verbessern?

Healthcare Analytics ist ein Team innerhalb der SHaPE-Practice (Social, Healthcare and Public Entities) mit Fokus auf die spezialisierte Beratung von Einrichtungen des Gesundheitswesens, insbesondere Kostenträger.

Im Healthcare Analytics Team handeln wir unternehmerisch. Daher suchen wir jemanden mit Motivation, kontinuierlich den Status Quo zu verbessern und dies auch eigenständig voranzutreiben.

Als Analyst wird erwartet, dass du Expertise in mindestens einem Segment des deutschen Gesundeitswesens (z.B. Krankenversicherungen oder Leistunserbringer) besitzt erste Erfahrungen bzw. eine Begeisterung für quantitative Analysen mitbringst. Darüber hinaus, hast du das Interesse dich in beiden Bereichen umfangreich fortzubilden und weiteres Wissen und Fähigkeiten zu erlangen.

Bei entsprechender Qualificiation ist eine Anstellung als Specialist möglich.

Collaborate and connect with domain experts to solve data obstacles in various industries
Develop advanced data reporting and visualizations
Apply data modeling methodologies and contribute to a robust data platform for our clients


Who You Are

Technologies you’ll use

Working with multiple clients, we are in touch with many technologies, which is truly exciting. We aim to use state-of-the-art technologies while being fully pragmatic (we do not crack a walnut with a sledgehammer). We follow an ELT philosophy and divide the tasks between Data Engineering and Analytics Engineering accordingly.

The Following Technologies Constitute Our Preferred Data Tech Stack


Data Loading
For most clients, we use our own open-source Python library EWAH and Apache Airflow
For simple requests, we work with Fivetran or Stitch
Data Warehousing
For smaller data loads, we mostly use PostgreSQL databases
For larger datasets, we work with Snowflake or BigQuery
Data Transformation
We love to work with data build tool (dbt)
Data Visualization


For smaller businesses with < 100 FTE, we mostly recommend Metabase as a powerful open-source reporting tool
For specified needs and a centralized BI, we recommend PowerBI or Tableau
For a decentralized, self-service BI with more than 50 users, we recommend Looker


Gemma Perks

We are located in Berlin, close to Nordbahnhof. We are currently 20 colleagues and will grow to 22 colleagues until the end of the year. Other perks include


We have an honest, inclusive work environment and want to nurture this environment
We have frequent team events in Berlin: our cultural base
We encourage workcations and even do workcations as a company - it is up to you to come to the office between one and five days a week
We don’t compromise on equipment - a powerful Laptop, extra screens, and all the tools you need to be effective
We will surround you with great people who love to solve (mostly data) riddles
We believe in efficient working hours rather than long working hours - we focus on the output rather than the input
We learn and share during meetups, lunch & learn sessions and are open for further initiatives
We pay a market-friendly salary and we additionally distribute at least 20% of profits to our employees
We are fast-growing, have technology at our core, yet we do not rely on a VC and operate profitably
We have a great yearly offsite event that brings us all together for a full week, enjoying good food, having a good time, and of course, solving complex data-related tasks solving complex data-related tasks

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

Salary: Up to £50,000 plus generous package




Location: London, Hybrid (3 days per week onsite)




Position: Permanent







I'm partnered with an ambitious and fast-growing wealth management group, backed by private equity and actively expanding through strategic acquisitions. This is a business that combines the agility of a scale-up with the backing and stability of a well-capitalised, established firm. Their modular approach to wealth services has positioned them as a major disruptor in the UK financial services space.




As part of this transformation journey, they are looking to bring on a Data Analyst - a key strategic and operational role reporting into the CTO. This role sits at the heart of technology operations and is instrumental in shaping how data is used to drive decisions, monitor performance, and deliver operational excellence across the technology function.




This isn’t a traditional back-office data role. You’ll act as the connective tissue between the CTO, Finance, Delivery, and other leadership teams, helping to ensure that data is consistently driving smarter decisions and strategic alignment.




What You’ll Be Doing:

Designing and maintaining executive dashboards that provide visibility into financials, supplier performance, risk, delivery metrics, and workforce analytics
Leading budget tracking, cost control, and forecasting within the technology function
Managing vendor data, including contract renewals, reviews, and supplier KPIs
Monitoring and reporting on operational and technology risks, security vulnerabilities, and audit items
Aggregating Agile delivery metrics and reporting progress against forecasted business benefits
Supporting governance and prioritisation processes with high-quality data and analysis
Acting as a liaison across key stakeholders, ensuring alignment and structured decision-making
Identifying and driving improvements across operational workflows




Skills and Qualifications:

Experience in a technology operations, business management, or data-driven strategy role
Financial experience across budgeting, variance analysis, and cost tracking; ideally with an accounting qualification (CIMA, ACCA, ACA) or equivalent experience
Excellent proficiency with data analytics tools - particularly Power BI and Excel
Deep understanding of IT operations, supplier management, and risk frameworks
Familiarity with Agile delivery principles and project performance tracking
Confident communicator, comfortable working with senior stakeholders and across departments
Ability to turn complex data into clear, actionable insight




Perks (to name a few):

Attractive employee pension scheme
25 days annual leave + public holidays + office Christmas close (3 days)
Buy and sell holidays up to 5 days
Private medical insurance, group life insurance, and income protection insurance
Discretionary performance-related bonus




This is a rare opportunity to join a business in high-growth mode, where you’ll be empowered to shape how data drives performance and technology strategy from the inside out. If this sounds like your kind of challenge, don't hesitate to apply!

£40,000 - £55,000 DOE

We're working with a fast-moving, customer-focused telco brand looking to bring in two Data Analysts - one more junior, one more mid-level - to help drive insight across their commercial and customer landscape.

This is a great opportunity for someone with solid SQL skills who wants hands-on experience, meaningful projects, and genuine growth opportunities (with a clear path to promotion over the next 12-24 months).

Collaborate with commercial, marketing, and country teams on strategic projects (e.g. handset launches, global campaign success)

Help improve data quality across the business and support wider insight efforts

Present findings to senior stakeholders, including finance and country managers

What They're Looking For

SQL is essential - window functions, joins, aggregations for the mid-level role

Strong business acumen and commercial thinking

Experience in customer/marketing analytics or a real desire to develop in that space

Bonus: Power BI, Python, exposure to presenting insights to non-technical audiences

Personality and mindset matter - curiosity, drive, and a collaborative approach are key

Salary

Junior Analyst: £40,000-£45,000

Mid-Level Analyst: Up to £55,000

Interview Process

Stage 1: Informal 30-min Teams chat with the Head of Analytics

At Proton, we believe that privacy is a fundamental human right and the cornerstone of democracy. Since our inception in 2014, founded by a team of scientists from CERN, we have dedicated ourselves to providing free and open-source technology to millions worldwide, ensuring access to privacy, security, and freedom online.

Our journey began with Proton Mail, the largest secure email service globally, and has since expanded to include Proton VPN, Proton Calendar, Proton Drive, and Proton Pass. These tools empower individuals and organizations to take control of their personal data, break away from Big Tech’s invasive practices, and defeat censorship. Our work impacts hundreds of millions of lives, from activists on the front lines defending freedom to leaders in governments protecting sensitive information. In some cases, Proton’s services have even been instrumental in saving lives by enabling secure and private communications in high-risk situations.

Proton is a profitable company that does not rely upon VC funding, supporting over 100 million user accounts with a growing team of over 500 people from over 50 different countries, from the world's top companies and universities. We value intelligence, learning potential, and ambition in our hiring process. Adaptability is key as we navigate uncharted territories and redefine how business is conducted online.

Hiring at Proton is highly selective, with less than 1% of candidates hired. We believe smaller teams of exceptional talent will always prevail over larger teams with lower talent density. You will have the opportunity work with many of the world's top minds in their fields, ranging from former international math and science olympiad winners to chess champions.

We have a global mindset and big ambitions but remain a start-up at heart. We value empowerment and flexibility and keep our structure flat to keep moving fast and avoid unnecessary politics. Tired of blending into the crowd? Join us and do work you can truly be proud of. Check our open-source projects here!

Purpose of the role

We are looking for a talented data analyst to help us support data-driven decision-making across the company. You will be embedded within a business unit (Mail, VPN, Drive, Growth, etc) and will play a key role in understanding our customers, guiding the team in their decision-making, and driving the implementation of new features and growth initiatives. As part of the data team, you will also collaborate with data science and data engineering in improving our data platform.

East London (Hybrid - 3 days per week)
£40,000 - £55,000 DOE

We're working with a fast-moving, customer-focused telco brand looking to bring in two Data Analysts - one more junior, one more mid-level - to help drive insight across their commercial and customer landscape.

This is a great opportunity for someone with solid SQL skills who wants hands-on experience, meaningful projects, and genuine growth opportunities (with a clear path to promotion over the next 12-24 months). You'll be working closely with a hands-on Head of Analytics, senior stakeholders, and cross-functional teams across the business.

The Role

Handle ad-hoc data pulls and reporting requests

Take ownership of dashboarding (Power BI), and improve visualisation/reporting processes

Deep dive into customer data - churn analysis, CLV projects, marketing campaign performance

Collaborate with commercial, marketing, and country teams on strategic projects (e.g. handset launches, global campaign success)

Help improve data quality across the business and support wider insight efforts

Present findings to senior stakeholders, including finance and country managers

What They're Looking For

SQL is essential - window functions, joins, aggregations for the mid-level role

Strong business acumen and commercial thinking

Experience in customer/marketing analytics or a real desire to develop in that space

Bonus: Power BI, Python, exposure to presenting insights to non-technical audiences

Personality and mindset matter - curiosity, drive, and a collaborative approach are key

Salary

Junior Analyst: £40,000-£45,000

Mid-Level Analyst: Up to £55,000

Interview Process

Stage 1: Informal 30-min Teams chat with the Head of Analytics

Stage 2: Presentation round + Q&A with the team

Optional sign-off with a senior stakeholder

This is an exciting chance to step into a role with visibility, variety, and loads of room to grow. Let us know if you'd like to hear more.

Salary: Up to £50,000 plus generous package




Location: London, Hybrid (3 days per week onsite)




Position: Permanent







I'm partnered with an ambitious and fast-growing wealth management group, backed by private equity and actively expanding through strategic acquisitions. This is a business that combines the agility of a scale-up with the backing and stability of a well-capitalised, established firm. Their modular approach to wealth services has positioned them as a major disruptor in the UK financial services space.




As part of this transformation journey, they are looking to bring on a Data Analyst - a key strategic and operational role reporting into the CTO. This role sits at the heart of technology operations and is instrumental in shaping how data is used to drive decisions, monitor performance, and deliver operational excellence across the technology function.




This isn’t a traditional back-office data role. You’ll act as the connective tissue between the CTO, Finance, Delivery, and other leadership teams, helping to ensure that data is consistently driving smarter decisions and strategic alignment.




What You’ll Be Doing:

Designing and maintaining executive dashboards that provide visibility into financials, supplier performance, risk, delivery metrics, and workforce analytics
Leading budget tracking, cost control, and forecasting within the technology function
Managing vendor data, including contract renewals, reviews, and supplier KPIs
Monitoring and reporting on operational and technology risks, security vulnerabilities, and audit items
Aggregating Agile delivery metrics and reporting progress against forecasted business benefits
Supporting governance and prioritisation processes with high-quality data and analysis
Acting as a liaison across key stakeholders, ensuring alignment and structured decision-making
Identifying and driving improvements across operational workflows




Skills and Qualifications:

Experience in a technology operations, business management, or data-driven strategy role
Financial experience across budgeting, variance analysis, and cost tracking; ideally with an accounting qualification (CIMA, ACCA, ACA) or equivalent experience
Excellent proficiency with data analytics tools - particularly Power BI and Excel
Deep understanding of IT operations, supplier management, and risk frameworks
Familiarity with Agile delivery principles and project performance tracking
Confident communicator, comfortable working with senior stakeholders and across departments
Ability to turn complex data into clear, actionable insight




Perks (to name a few):

Attractive employee pension scheme
25 days annual leave + public holidays + office Christmas close (3 days)
Buy and sell holidays up to 5 days
Private medical insurance, group life insurance, and income protection insurance
Discretionary performance-related bonus




This is a rare opportunity to join a business in high-growth mode, where you’ll be empowered to shape how data drives performance and technology strategy from the inside out. If this sounds like your kind of challenge, don't hesitate to apply!

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Compose pipelines by writing SQL code to clean, combine, refine, and aggregate data into the insights the organization needs.
Collaborating on new datasets to ingest into our Snowflake data warehouse, working closely with data engineers on your team.
Not afraid of pushing code that supports tens of billions of dollars in daily transaction volume.

Proven track record in data modeling, statistics, and analytics
Experience working with a broad range of stakeholders
Strong convictions weakly held.
You enjoy working in a fast-paced start-up environment, where you'll need to take initiative and solve problems independently.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources
Define and monitor key economic impact metrics
Go deep on understanding business drivers, user segments, cohorts and macroeconomic trends
Prepare presentations, analyses and visualizations for internal and external executive audiences
Partner closely with Communications, Policy, Marketing and Product teams to identify and analyze key trends and produce thought leadership pieces and campaign content leveraging Stripe data
Collaborate with external vendors, academics, and think tanks to advance Stripe’s research agenda and advocacy positions



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.<br><br>Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources
Define and monitor key economic impact metrics
Go deep on understanding business drivers, user segments, cohorts and macroeconomic trends
Prepare presentations, analyses and visualizations for internal and external executive audiences
Partner closely with Communications, Policy, Marketing and Product teams to identify and analyze key trends and produce thought leadership pieces and campaign content leveraging Stripe data
Collaborate with external vendors, academics, and think tanks to advance Stripe’s research agenda and advocacy positions



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Join our team as we create a world of stories and knowledge, democratize the exchange of ideas and information, and empower collective expertise through our three products: Everand, Scribd, and Slideshare.

We support a culture where our employees can be real and be bold; where we debate and commit as we embrace plot twists; and where every employee is empowered to take action as we prioritize the customer.

When it comes to workplace structure, we believe in balancing individual flexibility and community connections. It’s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees – in partnership with their manager – can choose the daily work-style that best suits their individual needs. A key tenet of Scribd Flex is our prioritization of intentional in-person moments to build collaboration, culture, and connection. For this reason, occasional in-person attendance is required for all Scribd employees, regardless of their location.

So what are we looking for in new team members? Well, we hire for “GRIT”. The textbook definition of GRIT is demonstrating the intersection of passion and perseverance towards long term goals. At Scribd, we are inspired by the potential that this can unlock, and ask each of our employees to pursue a GRIT-ty approach to their work. In a tactical sense, GRIT is also a handy acronym that outlines the standards we hold ourselves and each other to.

Job Summary

The Statistical Analyst will be responsible for providing expertise in research designs and statistical analysis plans and leading integrative statistical analyses for multiple projects within Dr. Laura Schummers’s research team. The incumbent will perform and lead statistical analysis using large datasets for ongoing research projects and lead the development, planning, and execution of new research projects. This will largely focus on a CIHR-funded program of research examining impacts of policy and practice change on reproductive population health using quantitative methods from epidemiology and health policy and may involve offering statistical analysis services to collaborating or related research teams on a cost-recovery basis. This currently includes studies on pregnancy spacing; abortion safety and access; impacts of contraception policy on access, use, costs, and outcomes; miscarriage epidemiology; pharmacist survey evaluating contraception prescribing; and methodological work related to database and cohort development using population-based administrative health data.

The position will require advanced statistical methodological understanding and advanced programming skill. Reporting and documentation will require descriptive and inferential analysis of data, as well as the production of publication quality tables and figures to present results. The research datasets being used in these studies involve the linkage of birth records, pharmaceutical and health claims data, hospital records, and other linkable routinely collected data. The Statistical Analyst will perform complex linkages, considering both individual-level linkages and pregnancy-level linkages within the same data, and will create analysis-ready datasets tailored to study-specific analytic plan or trainee-led project needs.

The Statistical Analyst will be responsible for data management, testing and analysis; they will use raw, claims-level databases to construct cohorts and research variables that the research team requires for analysis. The Statistical Analyst will lead and work closely with the investigator team to define and operationalize research concepts in large, linked datasets being used in these studies. The Statistical Analyst will conduct advanced statistical analyses, under the supervision of the Principal Investigator, including controlled interrupted time series, difference-in-differences, synthetic control designs, multivariable regression modeling (including propensity scores for continuous and categorical exposure variables, model assumption verification), and may expand to include g-methods for causal inference (such as inverse probability weighting for marginal structural models). The Statistical Analyst will collaborate with the Principal Investigator and investigator teams to develop appropriate analysis plans for new projects in the design phase. This will include informing and writing methods components of grant proposals, providing advanced expertise in study design and statistical approaches, and introducing new statistical methodologies/designs that may improve rigor and feasibility of proposed or ongoing studies. The Statistical Analyst will provide methodological and programming leadership for the research team, including support, training, and capacity development of team members and trainees, code review, and oversight of trainee-led analyses. They will work with investigators, trainees, and collaborators to enhance data presentations.

Several ongoing and future projects will involve collaboration with analysts in other Canadian provinces for pooled and federated analyses of provincially-held administrative data. To support these projects, the Statistical Analyst will, in most cases, be responsible for leading data cleaning, cohort creation, and variable harmonization with those analysts to ensure consistent methods and common data models. For pooled analyses of these administrative data, the Statistical Analyst will guide analysts in other provinces to prepare and export data in consistent formats, receive and merge exported data to create a single analytic file, and lead all statistical modeling.

Organizational Status

The Collaboration for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CORE) is the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science’s multidisciplinary group of outcomes researchers specializing in epidemiology, health economics, health services research, and pharmacy practice research. Research conducted by CORE faculty members is directly aligned with the Faculty’s Health Outcomes theme. The Statistical Analyst will report directly to the Principal Investigator of this research group within CORE, Dr. Laura Schummers https://pharmsci.ubc.ca/directory/laura-schummers

The primary role of the Statistical Analyst is to inform and conduct rigorous analysis of health datasets for the range of studies included across the research program led by the team PI. The Statistical Analyst will be required to interact with researchers, faculty, trainees, and support staff, within UBC, and collaborators across the wider research and knowledge user communities, including some personnel in provincial and federal governments. Good interpersonal, communication, and collaborative team skills are essential. The work requires use of confidential data files from government programs, professional associations, and population-based surveys and will require diplomacy and good interpersonal skills.

Responsibilities include:


Conduct extensive programming for the management and use of complex large data sets using a variety of software and languages, such as SAS/R/Stata, to explore data validity, develop research variables/algorithms/flags, create analytic cohorts for each study, create sub-cohorts for trainee-led analyses, and conduct statistical analysis using study date (primarily linked administrative health data).
Provide input on data requests for health administrative data (e.g., Population Data BC, Perinatal Services BC, Health Data Research Network) as needed.
Conduct programming for the development of complex, novel study cohorts, under the guidance of the PI and in collaboration with team members, including required documentation of processes.
Provide advanced methodological and statistical expertise to support the design of proposed and ongoing studies, including through the introduction of new statistical methodologies/designs that may improve rigor and feasibility.
Lead pooled and federated analyses, in collaboration with analysts in other provinces and jurisdictions, to ensure harmonized approaches to the management and analysis of administrative data required for cross-jurisdictional research studies;
Employ advanced statistical analytic methods, including multivariable modeling, quasi-experimental methods (e.g., interrupted time series, difference-in-differences), and use of synthetic controls.
Identify potential validity issues with data and suggest methodological approaches to overcome limitations to the research team.
Prepare documentation for members of the research team, including publication-quality tables ad graphs.
Performs analysis and interpretation of data received from a variety of sources producing related reports, tables and charts.

The Statistical Analyst will perform complex linkages, considering both individual-level linkages and pregnancy-level linkages within the same data, and will create analysis-ready datasets tailored to study-specific analytic plan or trainee-led project needs.<br><br>The Statistical Analyst will be responsible for data management, testing and analysis; they will use raw, claims-level databases to construct cohorts and research variables that the research team requires for analysis. The Statistical Analyst will lead and work closely with the investigator team to define and operationalize research concepts in large, linked datasets being used in these studies. The Statistical Analyst will conduct advanced statistical analyses, under the supervision of the Principal Investigator, including controlled interrupted time series, difference-in-differences, synthetic control designs, multivariable regression modeling (including propensity scores for continuous and categorical exposure variables, model assumption verification), and may expand to include g-methods for causal inference (such as inverse probability weighting for marginal structural models). The Statistical Analyst will collaborate with the Principal Investigator and investigator teams to develop appropriate analysis plans for new projects in the design phase. This will include informing and writing methods components of grant proposals, providing advanced expertise in study design and statistical approaches, and introducing new statistical methodologies/designs that may improve rigor and feasibility of proposed or ongoing studies. The Statistical Analyst will provide methodological and programming leadership for the research team, including support, training, and capacity development of team members and trainees, code review, and oversight of trainee-led analyses. They will work with investigators, trainees, and collaborators to enhance data presentations.<br><br>Several ongoing and future projects will involve collaboration with analysts in other Canadian provinces for pooled and federated analyses of provincially-held administrative data. To support these projects, the Statistical Analyst will, in most cases, be responsible for leading data cleaning, cohort creation, and variable harmonization with those analysts to ensure consistent methods and common data models. For pooled analyses of these administrative data, the Statistical Analyst will guide analysts in other provinces to prepare and export data in consistent formats, receive and merge exported data to create a single analytic file, and lead all statistical modeling.<br><br><strong>Organizational Status<br><br></strong>The Collaboration for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CORE) is the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science’s multidisciplinary group of outcomes researchers specializing in epidemiology, health economics, health services research, and pharmacy practice research.

Vancity is a member-owned credit union built on the principles of inclusion and social justice. A relentless commitment to their values has helped them challenge the status quo and break down barriers since day one in 1946. They have bold commitments to make Vancity net-zero by 2040 across all mortgages and loans and are pursuing strategies on Indigenous banking and to improve the financial resilience of their members.




Vancity is the largest private sector Living Wage Employer in Canada and has been consistently recognized as one of the Top Employers in Canada.




About the workplace

The Senior Analyst Insights reports to the Manager, Climate Strategy and Performance, and works closely with our Analytics Centre of Excellence. The scope of the role is enterprise wide, and key responsibilities include extracting and handling large complex datasets, developing/implementing solutions to improve processes, generating actionable insights, and tracking progress on Vancity’s climate commitments. The role requires strong data management practices and the ability to communicate analysis and data insights visually, verbally and in writing.




The analyst will support a wide range of initiatives including those related to climate change, financial health and inclusion, and sustainable finance. The role includes monitoring relevant best practices and relevant external frameworks and standards to identify and implement

improvements, and there will be opportunities to represent Vancity in external working groups.




The analyst will be responsible for generating data for impact and climate-related reports and disclosures. This includes quantifying financed emissions using methodologies from the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), tracking progress on Vancity’s interim climate targets, and generating and reporting data for other Impact related initiatives including Triple Bottom Line Assets Under Administration.




This role requires someone with excellent technical and analytical skills, as well as strong problem solving, communications and project management skills. The analyst will ensure strong disclosure and review controls are in place to support external assurance. While not required, the ideal candidate will have subject matter expertise in sustainability and climate-related topics, especially as they pertain to financial institutions.




This is a 12-month contract role that will enjoy hybrid working arrangements which can be fulfilled primarily from the Vancity head office location and your Lower Mainland based home office. This role may require you to work in-office at least once a week.




A typical day may involve:

Resolving complex information needs and translating them into executable research and analytics initiatives.
Compiling and communicating regular and ad hoc reports, research and analytics insights to enable the delivery of key business strategies and decisions, including dashboards.
Designing, building, reviewing and improving analytical processes and solutions to enable effective decision-making in support of Vancity’s climate, financial health & inclusion, indigenous banking and other impact strategies (including member valuation frameworks, segmentations, and predictive models).
Recommending and supporting data improvement initiatives including data preparation, data access and data reliability. Evaluating and integrating internal and external data sets.

We support a culture where our employees can be real and be bold; where we debate and commit as we embrace plot twists; and where every employee is empowered to take action as we prioritize the customer.

When it comes to workplace structure, we believe in balancing individual flexibility and community connections.
