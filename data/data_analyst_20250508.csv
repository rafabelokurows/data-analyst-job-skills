Do you perform best when working in a team, but are also willing to go solo when needed?

If you answered “yes - that’s me!” to the questions above, then you should join Softlab’s Digital Marketing & Sales Practice as Digital Data Analyst (remote-first role, contractually based in Milano): you’ll be working closely with our clients’ teams to provide key data insights, using state-of-art digital analytics tools, that drive business decisions impacting both online and offline channels.

Use available digital & non-digital data for answering any analytics-related question coming from business stakeholders
Translate high-level commercial requests into meaningful KPIs, and then in metrics and dimensions that can be measured
Present the results of your analyses being able to summarize the key insights, but also to drill down in the details
Proactively push to improve the status quo by experimenting with data analysis




What you bring

Good knowledge of Excel
Good knowledge of SAS, SQL, R, Python or similar solution for data analysis
Preferred: hands-on experience with digital analytics tools usage (e.g. Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics)

Exciting work with innovative technologies and solutions: you will develop hard and soft skills that will always come handy, and will help defining advanced standards and best practices
Remote-ready work: if the project allows it, you’ll have the possibility to work wherever there is a reliable Internet connection (the role will be contractually based in Milano)

Geo Solutions is een Belgisch bedrijf dat organisaties helpt om de kracht van locatiedata ten volle te benutten. Wij ontwerpen en ontwikkelen slimme GEO-ICT oplossingen op maat. Onze innovatieve en flexibele dienstverlening ondersteunt klanten in de overheid, nutsbedrijven, industrie en constructie bij strategische en operationele beslissingen.




Waar je ons terugvindt? Wel, ons hoofdkantoor is gelegen in Edegem, maar we bieden ook flexplekken aan in onze hubs in Gent, Leuven en Namen. Daarnaast zal je ook op wekelijkse basis ter plaatse op je toegewezen project bij je klant werken.




Zo ziet jouw rol als Data Analist eruit:

Werkplek: bij je klant, Geo-kantoor/hub, thuis




Als Data Analist bij Geo Solutions maak je locatiedata inzichtelijk voor onze klanten. Een achtergrond in de brede wereld van geo is niet noodzakelijk, maar je hart mag wel een slagje sneller slaan bij het zien van X, Y en Z’s.




Een greep uit je takenpakket:

Je vertaalt businessnoden naar datavereisten, en je kan daar helder over communiceren.
Je voert diepgaande en kwalitatieve analyses uit op complexe datasets en zet de bevindingen om naar heldere rapporten.
Je schat het potentieel van use cases in door een eerste exploratieve screening. Daarbij zet je zowel een sceptische als opportunistische bril op.
Je volgt technologische ontwikkelingen op en deelt actief je kennis met interne en externe collega’s.




Jouw profiel:

Bachelor- of masterdiploma in IT of een wetenschappelijke richting
Minstens 5 jaar ervaring als data analist of een vergelijkbare rol
Sterk in Python met ervaring in (Geo)Pandas, NumPy, Folium, DuckDB, Polars, …
Ervaren in SQL en ETL-processen
Vaardig met BI- tools (Power BI, Tableau, Qlik, Superset) bij voorkeur met geografische data
Ervaring met big data (Hadoop, Spark, Databricks) en cloudplatformen (Azure, GCP, AWS)
Kennis van AI/ML (TensorFlow, Torch, Keras) is een plus
Vloeiend Nederlands en Engels zijn een evidentie




Dit krijg je van ons

In ruil voor je inzet en leergierigheid bieden we je een boeiende job met toffe collega’s. En dat in een bedrijfscultuur die persoonlijke ontwikkeling en vernieuwing sterk aanmoedigt.




Bij Geo Solutions mag je rekenen op:

Een aantrekkelijk salarispakket: een brutoloon (rekening houden met je ervaring en diploma), aangevuld met bedrijfswagen en tankkaart (of laadkaart), maaltijdcheques, hospitalisatie- en groepsverzekering, maandelijkse onkostenvergoeding.
Een gezonde werk-life balans: zo willen wij plezier binnen en buiten de werkuren motivering door flexibele werktijden aan te bieden
Aandacht voor nieuwe ideeën: hier ben je geen nummer, wel een belangrijke aanwinst voor het team. We horen graag hoe jij bepaalde projecten ziet en hoe jij het zou aanpakken
Doorgroeimogelijkheden: we juichen met veel plezier je leergierigheid toe en bieden je toegang tot onze Geo Academy. Wil je graag een extra training volgen, een certificaat behalen of een externe opleiding volgen, dat kan allemaal!
State of the art technologieën: je bouwt ze niet alleen, je werkt er ook mee!




Kan je niet wachten om ons team te versterken? Stuur je cv en een korte motivatie naar jobs@geosolutions.be




Diversiteit, inclusie en gelijkheid

Bij ons draait het om mensen. We willen een plek zijn waar je jezelf kunt zijn, ongeacht wie je bent of hoe je in het leven staat.

Nous allons réaliser ensemble

Dans le cadre de notre transformation digitale et de l’adoption d’une architecture Data Mesh, nous recherchons un·e Business Data Analyst passionné·e par la donnée et par la compréhension fine des enjeux métier. Vous serez le lien direct entre les équipes opérationnelles et les équipes techniques, en transformant les besoins métiers en cas d’usage data concrets et en accompagnant leur mise en œuvre au sein de notre plateforme de données moderne basée sur Microsoft Azure (Databricks, Fabric, Power BI, dbt).

Intégré·e à l’unité « Données et Innovation » (rattachée à la direction informatique de SIG), vous participerez activement à l’identification, la formalisation et la priorisation des cas d’usage, à la définition des modèles de données et à la conception des livrables.

La donnée est désormais au cœur de la transformation digitale de l’entreprise. Elle devient un actif stratégique à forte valeur ajoutée. Votre rôle sera de détecter cette valeur et de faciliter son exploitation par nos équipes métiers.

Vous êtes convaincu·e que la donnée est un levier de performance et d’innovation ? Vous souhaitez travailler au plus proche des métiers tout en collaborant avec des experts data et IT ? Alors ce poste est fait pour vous.

Votre énergie au service d’une Genève durable

En tant que Business Data Analyst, votre mission principale consiste à :


Analyse et cadrage des besoins métiers
Animer des ateliers de cadrage avec les équipes métiers (interviews, co-construction, Data/Event Storming, etc.) afin d’identifier les cas d’usage à forte valeur ajoutée et les traduire en exigences fonctionnelles claires ;
Contribuer à la structuration des données métiers en lien avec les principes du Domain-Driven Design ;
Participer activement à la conception des couches Silver et Gold de l’architecture en médaillon, en lien avec les ingénieurs de données et les experts en modélisation de données.



Gouvernance et documentation métier
Formaliser et maintenir des glossaires, dictionnaires de données, référentiels métier et autres artefacts favorisant une compréhension partagée des données ;
Contribuer à la qualité des données, en collaborant à la mise en place de tests de validation et à la définition de data contracts entre producteurs et consommateurs ;
Accompagner les équipes dans la conformité réglementaire et participer à la documentation et à la classification des données ;
Promouvoir une culture data partagée au sein de l’entreprise.



Interface entre métiers et data platform
Traduire les besoins métier en spécifications exploitables pour les équipes data et IT ;
Participer aux choix d’outils, de modèles et de bonnes pratiques pour renforcer l’intégration des usages métiers dans la plateforme de données SIG.

Votre personnalité et vos compétences

Techniques et méthodologiques


Bonne compréhension des principes du Domain-Driven Design (DDD) et capacité à collaborer avec les équipes métiers et data pour identifier les événements clés (via des ateliers tels que Data/Event Storming) ;
Maîtrise des fondamentaux de la modélisation analytique (ex. modèles en étoile, data marts) et bonne culture générale des architectures de données de type Data Mesh ;
Capacité à formaliser des data contracts pour structurer les échanges entre producteurs et consommateurs de données ;
Sensibilité à la qualité des données et participation à la définition de règles de validation fonctionnelles (data tests) ;
Connaissance des environnements Azure, Databricks, Fabric ou des outils de datavisualisation (Power BI), sans besoin de développement technique avancé.


Outils et méthodes


Capacité à produire ou relire des modèles UML ou logiques pour s'assurer de la cohérence entre les besoins métiers et les solutions mises en œuvre.


Qualités personnelles et relationnelles


Excellentes capacités d’analyse, de synthèse et de vulgarisation ;
Aisance dans l’animation de groupes de travail, la conduite d’interviews ou d’ateliers métiers :
Forte orientation client et esprit collaboratif pour faire le lien entre métiers, IT et gouvernance ;
Rigueur, autonomie, sens du détail et curiosité, avec une volonté constante de faire progresser les pratiques data ;
Capacité à accompagner le changement grâce à une communication claire, pédagogique et structurée.


Votre parcours académique

Vous êtes titulaire d’un diplôme universitaire, EPF ou équivalent en informatique, systèmes d’information, data science, ingénierie ou gestion, avec une expérience confirmée dans l’analyse de besoins métiers liés à la donnée.

Vous avez déjà œuvré en tant que Business Analyst ou dans un rôle similaire, en lien direct avec les utilisateurs métiers et les équipes data/techniques, dans des projets où la donnée est un levier de transformation. Vous êtes à l’aise dans des environnements complexes et en évolution, et savez faire preuve de curiosité, d’adaptabilité et d’autonomie.

Une connaissance des architectures de type Data Mesh, des principes de gouvernance data, ou une sensibilité aux enjeux du secteur de l’énergie constitue un véritable atout.

Our Culture:

We are committed to meet the energy needs of a growing population and we are committed to the energy transition. The volatility of the energy trading markets requires excellence in risk management and a culture of innovation. We are fully embracing the digital revolution.

You are an engineer with a pragmatic attitude. You feel the weight of responsibility that comes with taking systems into production. You easily switch between scripting and structured programming in typed languages. You understand cloud, provisioning and automation. And you know how to build robust systems.







How you will help to create value with Data & A

IAt Xebia we build strong Data & AI practices to deliver value to our clients and their customers. In the past, our team of data professionals has predicted the daily demand for millions of loaves of bread, built advanced energy-saving algorithms to nationwide scale, and set up data innovation labs at large multinational corporations. We enjoy great success in making top companies AI-driven — just think of what more we can achieve when YOU join our team!




In Switzerland, our journey is just beginning, collaborating closely with the Xebia Data Community in the Netherlands and Poland. This presents a lot of opportunities for you to actively influence and shape our initiatives within an innovative team characterized by a flat hierarchy. You'll have the chance to make a real impact and contribute to our growth from the ground up!




What your work as a Data Engineer Consultant will look like

As a Data Engineer Consultant, you will work on the backbone of the data infrastructure. You will help our clients to make the right design decisions and implement data pipelines. There is lots of data to store, many jobs to run and schedule, much configuration to be dealt with. You typically work at the client in teams that are a mix of people from Xebia Data and the client.




When you’re working on-site with a client you may come across something that is really difficult to solve. We’ve got your back as we at Xebia Data work as a team and will help you solve your problems, because everybody at Xebia Data is just a quick message away and ready to help at any time.




Who Are We Looking For?

The Data Engineer Consultant role is a senior position with a central role in our clients’ teams, and therefore we require at least 2 years of relevant professional experience. Having said that, we like to be amazed: so if you have done something outstanding during your studies, like contributing to open source projects or starting your own company, we encourage you to apply no matter what the level of your experience is.




THIS IS YOUR DREAM JOB IF…

✅ You like working with the latest data processing tools, like Airflow, Spark, Flink, and Druid

✅ You like to create, shape, and have a say.

✅ You like working with both code and people and enjoy the excitement of regularly getting to learn new environments and help your clients to be successful.

✅ You speak german at a professional level







THIS IS NOT YOUR DREAM JOB IF…

❌ You do not like to get things done in the best way possible with the limited time that you have available to finish it.

❌ You do not like working with open-source technology.

❌ You do not like coding, scripting, templating.







The Xebia Way

At Xebia we treat each other with respect, cooperation and a view towards creating an enthusiastic, self-empowered, dynamic working community. Our culture exudes creativity and ambition and our colleagues share an insatiable thirst for knowledge. We’re especially proud of our generous training budget and our “Hack-What-You-Want Fridays.""

In addition to a great culture, we provide competitive primary benefits:




competitive salary;
great pension plan;
extended holidays;
flexible workload;
monthly knowledge sharing sessions;
5k educational budget. And please, do spend every bit of it.

Job Description

We are seeking a Junior AI Engineer with foundational knowledge in AI, GenAI, and Machine Learning. You will join one of our AI teams and assist them in prototyping, maturing, and shipping AI features to a production-ready level.

You are a pragmatic, results-driven engineer who is eager to learn and understands modern AI stacks but thinks in terms of software reliability, performance, and user impact. You focus on creating scalable, observable solutions that solve real-world problems for our customers.

Because the role is cross-functional, the ability to communicate complex concepts in simple ways is essential. You will collaborate with product, design, front-end, and infrastructure teams to bring delightful AI features to life.

Responsibilities

As part of the AI team at Nexthink, you will:


Assist in implementing new AI features with high-quality coding standards and automated test coverage.
Support solving the engineering challenges behind data collection, retrieval, evaluation, and inference at scale.
Help build and maintain CI/CD pipelines for AI components, ensuring safe, repeatable deployments.
Instrument robust online/offline evaluation metrics and dashboards to monitor quality in production.
Proactively propose new product capabilities or improvements based on user data and technology advances.
Stay current with the rapidly evolving AI engineering ecosystem and share knowledge with the Nexthink community.
Communicate effectively with (non-technical) stakeholders such as product managers and UX designers.


Qualifications


BSc/MSc in Computer Science, Software Engineering or a related field
0-3 years of professional software-engineering experience, including internships or projects.
Basic experience in integrating with LLMs (e.g., Prompting, Evaluation, Observability).
Demonstrated interest in delivering AI-powered features that serve real users at scale (e.g., retrieval-augmented search, Generative AI assistants, predictive analytics).
Fluency in Python or at least one strongly-typed language (TypeScript or Java), with clean-code and testing discipline.
Understanding of cloud-native architectures (AWS or comparable), containerisation (Docker), and orchestration (Kubernetes / ECS).
Hands-on experience with MLOps: reproducible pipelines, automated evaluations, feature stores, CI/CD for models or prompt/embedding configs.
Strong data intuition: ability to inspect raw logs, design metrics, and quickly identify quality regressions.
Product mindset and empathy for end-users; able to translate fuzzy product requirements into incremental engineering plans.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills in English (spoken & written).


If you’re excited about joing one of the top companies working on AI and pushing the boundaries of AI we’d love to hear from you! Even if you don’t meet every requirement, we encourage you to apply—we value expertise, passion, and the drive to learn.
