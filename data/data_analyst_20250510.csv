Contribute to projects, proactively identify and raise potential opportunities or commonalities, and apply critical thinking to drive continuous improvement across the business.


What You’ll Need


A bachelor's degree or equivalent experience in information technology, engineering, statistics, computer science, business with analytics focus!

Chime is hiring a Senior Data Analyst to join a team focused on driving top-of-funnel growth! In this role, you’ll shape business decisions by delivering insights and analytics that optimize web performance, landing pages, enrollment funnel personalization, and content strategy. You’ll lead or contribute to cross-functional projects, using data to inform and influence strategic decision-making, while driving improvements through experimentation and deep analysis. Chime is member-obsessed, and this role is key to understanding how users engage with Chime—helping us create a more seamless and personalized experience.

The base salary offered for this role and level of experience will begin at $140,670 and up to $195,400. Full-time employees are also eligible for a bonus, competitive equity package, and benefits. The actual base salary offered may be higher, depending on your location, skills, qualifications, and experience.

In this role, you can expect to


Own reporting, analysis, and measurement strategies to track and optimize top-of-funnel performance.
Drive decisions by leveraging segmentation, leading experiments, and identifying patterns across web analytics, SEO engagement, and personalization to uncover high-impact growth opportunities.
Stay on top of performance metrics and KPIs, gaining a deep understanding of the business, product, and member base to explain trends and drive actionable insights.
Be an arbiter of truth with data—translating member interactions into business and experience implications.
Keep learning. Chime is evolving fast, and you’ll grow with it—both in business acumen and technical expertise.
Build strong partnerships. Collaborate across Marketing, Product, Finance, Operations & Member Experience, and Risk to ensure your insights drive real impact.
Ask ""why"" a lot—your curiosity and data skills will push the boundaries of what we understand and how we grow.


To thrive in this role, you have


5+ years in data-focused roles (excluding internships), with a strong focus on growth analytics.
Experience driving analytics for landing page optimization, full-funnel experimentation, measurement, and SEO performance.

Prior experience utilizing and owning third-party web analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Google Search Console, SEMrush, Google Tag Manager, UTMs, etc.) to analyze web behavior and conversion attribution.
Strong stakeholder management skills with a clear framework for how Analytics partners with business units to drive strategy.
Expertise in SQL – you intuitively translate business questions into queries, understand the edge cases of joins, and efficiently explore data warehouses to find the most relevant data for a problem.
A focus on impact – you go beyond insights and recommendations to see your work through to execution, driving measurable change in the business.

Collaborate closely with quant researchers, PMs, and risk managers to understand how data is consumed and enhance its usability
Ensure data quality, lineage, and availability across the firm's analytical infrastructure
Contribute to broader data modernization efforts across risk and research teams

Ideal Candidate:

3-7 years of experience in a data-driven role supporting front-office or research teams at a hedge fund, asset manager, or proprietary trading firm
Strong programming skills (Python preferred); experience with modern data tooling and pipeline design
Familiarity with financial market data, portfolio data, or risk data
Able to operate with autonomy in a lean, high-performance team

Must be willing to work from our SF office at least 3x per week

This position requires a commitment to a hybrid work model, with the expectation of coming into the office a minimum of (3) three times per week. Relocation assistance is available for candidates willing to move to San Francisco.

Why work at Abridge?

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

How we take care of Abridgers:


Generous Time Off: 13 paid holidays, flexible PTO for salaried employees, and accrued time off for hourly employees.
Comprehensive Health Plans: Medical, Dental, and Vision plans for all full-time employees. Abridge covers 100% of the premium for you and 75% for dependents. If you choose a HSA-eligible plan, Abridge also makes monthly contributions to your HSA.
Paid Parental Leave: 16 weeks paid parental leave for all full-time employees.
401k and Matching: Contribution matching to help invest in your future.
Pre-tax Benefits: Access to Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) and Commuter Benefits.
Learning and Development Budget: Yearly contributions for coaching, courses, workshops, conferences, and more.
Sabbatical Leave: 30 days of paid Sabbatical Leave after 5 years of employment.
Compensation and Equity: Competitive compensation and equity grants for full time employees.
... and much more!

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Payment Intelligence Engineering’s purpose is to mitigate threats to our systems in order to keep our merchants, Stripe and financial partners safe. We empower global businesses with intelligent solutions for conversion and fraud prevention, leveraging consumer intelligence and transparent ML to maximize growth and build trust. Our Payments Intelligence portfolio delivers actionable insights to all user segments.

The Payments Health Technical Operations team is pioneering new ways to achieve this mission. Our dynamic team relies on the expertise of integration reliability engineers and data analysts to identify gaps and build comprehensive solutions in the ever changing arena of fraud prevention.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and maintain SQL queries to analyze and navigate complex financial data effectively.
Enhance overall observability by identifying gaps and proposing actionable insights to improve our monitoring systems.
Actively hunt for patterns and anomalies in data that could indicate potential threats or operational issues.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to consolidate and gather relevant data for informed engineering efforts.
Design and implement comprehensive dashboards for real-time visibility into key metrics and system health.
Establish and refine key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress and improvements over time.
Support the creation and maintenance of observability frameworks to ensure early detection of issues.
Contribute to efforts that reduce organizational toil by optimizing data analysis processes.
Communicate findings and insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Stay updated with industry trends in data analysis and financial data handling to ensure best practices.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have 5+ years of experience in Payments at a leading technology or payments company
Have experience writing SQL to query relational databases
Have experience managing communications and workflows with technical and non-technical teams across internal and external stakeholders
Experience mentoring junior team members in technical skill development, operational strategy and problem solving
Have experience navigating the nuanced complexity of financial systems and solving large scale, technical challenges
Have strong financial modeling and analytical skills to investigate, prioritize, and identify the root cause of issues
Have experience managing multiple, concurrent work streams, identifying and triaging technical issues and driving solutions with clear metrics to show impact



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,400 - $219,600. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have a true love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem and living inside a spreadsheet or data set to find the answer to any question.
You have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization tools, and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis.
Experience with Marketing APIs, BigQuery or other cloud data warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks), ETL tools (such as Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics), and/or Python is a plus.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and at least 1 year of experience working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.

What You’ll Do:




Reporting:

Maintain customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence.
Use Advanced Excel, SQL, and Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools to generate pivot tables and other visualizations summarizing thousands of lines of data.
Translate performance media metrics into clear, digestible reports for client advertising campaigns.
Communicate insights effectively through Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.




Strategy:

Learn our clients’ businesses and align media strategy with their business goals.
Analyze advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to guide media buying strategy.
Apply your background in paid media and/or digital advertising, including understanding concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue.
Engage in discussions with clients to build trust and gain stakeholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.




Gupta Media is an office-first organization.

Vous avez la capacité à transformer un océan de chiffres en informations stratégiques précieuses pour l’entreprise ? À l’aise avec les statistiques et les bases de données, vous décelez les tendances et les comportements clients ? Vous aimez analyser et visualiser des données complexes ? Ce métier vous place au cœur des décisions stratégiques avec une analyse précise des données récoltées.

Parce que chaque donnée compte pour optimiser sa stratégie, Arte France Développement, filiale d’Arte France, recrute un data analyst pour soutenir la croissance de l’activité Vidéo à la Demande (VOD) liée à la plateforme Arte Boutique et à la distribution des contenus de son catalogue auprès des plateformes partenaires.




Vous aurez comme mission :




Analyse Data :

Analyser des ensembles de données pour identifier les tendances et les modèles pertinents pour nourrir notre dynamique de croissance
Effectuer des analyses statistiques pour valider des résultats
Proposer des recommandations basées sur les résultats d’analyse
Elaborer des rapports et des tableaux de bord pour communiquer les résultats aux équipes
Assurer la qualité des données en réalisant des vérifications régulières

Veille technologique et suivi de l’activité :

Faire de la veille technologique des nouveaux outils visant à l’améliorer l’analyse des données
Mettre en œuvre et exploiter des technologies pour automatiser la collecte et l’analyse de données
Concevoir et exécuter des expériences pour tester des hypothèses

Coordination :

Travailler en étroite collaboration avec les équipes marketing, commercial et éditorial pour identifier leurs besoins et répondre à leurs questions stratégiques




Profil recherché




Parce que le rôle de Data Analyst est clé dans notre développement, nous recherchons les compétences suivantes :

compréhension approfondie des concepts statistiques et des méthodes d’analyse
capacité à communiquer efficacement des résultats à des non-spécialistes
compétences en visualisation des données
maîtrise des outils d’analyse de données, tels que SQL, R ou Python
aptitude à résoudre des problèmes complexes en utilisant des données
attention aux détails pour garantir l’exactitude des analyses
compétences en gestion de projet pour gérer des échéances et des priorités
capacité à travailler de manière autonome et en équipe




Parce qu’on aime bien les petits plus :

Le cinéma, les documentaires et les séries, ça vous parle ? Parce que vous allez baigner dedans. Autant vous préparer à disserter sur le dernier Ozon ou à imaginer « En thérapie » Saison 3 entre deux régressions statistiques
Do you speak english ? On aime bien aussi la langue de Shakespeare ou de Christopher Nolan, surtout qu’elle peut être très utile pour le poste
Comme on est déjà équipé, la connaissance d’Amplitude vous donnera un petit avantage, mais une customer data platform reste une customer data platform
Questions cursus : master en marketing, master en big data, master en mathématiques ou spécialisation en statistiques nous paraissent un bon début. Si vous avez en plus 3 ans d’expérience minimum dans un poste similaire




Si vous vous reconnaissez dans cette description ? On a très envie de vous rencontrer.




Le groupe ARTE est convaincu que la pluralité des talents et des parcours est une force et s’engage en faveur de la diversité et de l’inclusion.

Data Analyst (Marketplace, Seller Experience Team)

The Data Analyst – Seller Experience will play a central role in driving data-informed decisions across the entire Seller Experience division at eMAG. This role goes beyond a traditional reporting function; it is a strategic partner embedded directly in the product and experience organization. The analyst will support multiple verticals including seller onboarding, acquisition channels, performance monitoring, funnel optimization, UI/UX governance, and A/B testing initiatives.

Working closely with product managers, UX, content, comms, and seller support teams, the analyst will be responsible for creating and maintaining dashboards, conducting deep-dive analyses, and helping define KPIs that drive product prioritization and continuous improvement. This includes support across both web and mobile surfaces, as well as strategic initiatives like rating systems, personalization frameworks, and educational tools for sellers.

The role requires a balance of strong technical skills (SQL, data visualization, experimentation methods) and a good understanding of product dynamics. The analyst is expected to translate large volumes of raw data into insights that are easy to understand, actionable, and aligned with the annual OKRs of the division, reviewed monthly.

What you’ll have to do:


Partner with Product Managers, UX Designers, and other stakeholders to define, monitor, and evolve product KPIs across all seller-facing surfaces (e.g., dashboard, mobile app, onboarding flows, CRM).
Design and maintain self-service dashboards that support day-to-day decision-making across the Seller Experience division.
Analyze behavioral data to uncover insights on seller engagement, feature adoption, friction points, and drop-off across funnels.
Build tracking plans and collaborate with developers to ensure consistent and reliable event instrumentation across platforms.
Own the end-to-end analysis lifecycle for major initiatives: define the hypothesis, pull and validate the data, analyze trends, and present actionable recommendations.
Conduct A/B test analysis to validate the impact of new features or experience changes, ensuring statistical rigor and clear communication of results.
Identify data quality issues, propose solutions, and work with engineering or data teams to address inconsistencies or gaps.
Provide ongoing support to quarterly OKRs and monthly performance reviews by delivering insights that shape prioritization and roadmap adjustments.
Contribute to the creation of a shared understanding of seller behavior across teams by building consistent reporting layers and documentation.
Continuously seek opportunities to improve how data is captured, structured, visualized, and used in decision-making across the division.


Reporting Structure


Reports directly to the Product Director, Seller Experience.
Collaborates closely with multiple Product Managers, Product Owners, Business Analysts, UX Designers, and Content/Communication teams.
Acts as the primary analytical partner for initiatives across acquisition channels, onboarding, dashboard usage, UI/UX governance, funnel performance, and experimentation.
Works in alignment with the centralized Data & AI team for access to infrastructure, best practices, and integration with platform-wide data models.
Participates in monthly OKR check-ins and product performance reviews alongside division leadership.


Success Metrics

The success of the Data Analyst – Seller Experience will be evaluated through a combination of impact-driven results, execution quality, and alignment with the division’s annual OKRs. Key performance indicators include:

Impact Metrics


Coverage of KPIs: Defined and tracked KPIs for all key product areas (e.g., onboarding, dashboard usage, mobile, login, CRM, etc.).
Funnel Clarity: Improved visibility into seller behavior across acquisition and engagement funnels, leading to actionable product decisions.
OKR Support: Quality and relevance of data used to support quarterly prioritization and monthly performance reviews.
A/B Test Insights: Volume and quality of validated experiments (e.g., share of releases backed by statistically significant test results).


Execution Quality Metrics


Dashboard Adoption: Number of self-service dashboards built and actively used by product, UX, and support teams.
Speed to Insight: Time from data request to first actionable insight, especially around high-impact product changes.
Data Accuracy: Reduction in reporting inconsistencies or data-related blockers in decision-making.
Collaboration Score: Internal feedback from PMs and stakeholders regarding clarity, responsiveness, and value of delivered insights.


What makes you a good fit:

Experience And Background


3+ years of experience in a Data Analyst or Product Analyst role, preferably in a digital product or eCommerce environment.
Proven ability to work with product and cross-functional teams to generate actionable insights that drive measurable outcomes.
Experience supporting product discovery, feature rollout, and UX iteration cycles through structured analysis.


Technical Skills


Strong proficiency in SQL (e.g., BigQuery, PostgreSQL, or similar) for data extraction, transformation, and performance analysis.
Experience building and maintaining dashboards in BI tools such as Looker, Tableau, Power BI, or similar.
Familiarity with product analytics tools like Amplitude, Mixpanel, or Google Analytics for behavior tracking and funnel analysis.
Ability to design and interpret A/B tests; understanding of statistical significance, test design, and experimentation platforms.
Experience working with large datasets, joining across multiple sources (e.g., CRM, product logs, feedback platforms).
Comfortable working with data in Google Sheets, Excel, or Python (optional but a plus).


Analytical Thinking and Business Context


Ability to transform vague questions into structured analysis plans, and raw data into clear business narratives.
Solid understanding of metrics frameworks: DAU, MAU, conversion rates, retention curves, NPS, engagement ratios, etc.
Experience defining KPIs and building metric hierarchies for product dashboards, funnels, or seller engagement.
High attention to detail when validating data quality or interpreting trends.
Understanding of marketplace dynamics and multi-stakeholder ecosystems is a strong plus.


Communication and Collaboration


Able to communicate complex data findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
Experience working alongside Product Managers, UX Designers, and Content/Support teams to iterate on solutions.
Strong documentation skills: analysis notes, dashboards, tracking plans, etc.
Proactive and self-driven: able to push analysis forward even when requirements are not fully defined.


What makes you stand out:


Familiarity with experimentation platforms (e.g., Optimizely, Google Optimize, or in-house testing tools).
Prior experience supporting B2B platforms or seller/vendor interfaces.
Understanding of UI/UX data modeling or behavioral analytics.
Exposure to Python or dbt for data modeling is a plus.


Growth Opportunities

This role offers the opportunity to grow as a strategic analytical partner across one of eMAG’s most dynamic product areas. As the Seller Experience division continues to evolve, the Data Analyst will be well-positioned to deepen their impact and accelerate their career growth through:


Domain Ownership: Ability to progressively own specific verticals (e.g., onboarding, mobile seller app, performance tools) and become the go-to expert for data-driven decisions in that space.
Strategic Influence: Increased participation in quarterly planning, OKR setting, and roadmap validation by shaping how data is used to assess opportunity, risk, and performance.
Methodological Depth: Development in areas such as experimentation design, segmentation models, retention analysis, or funnel diagnostics—based on business needs and personal interest.
Cross-Divisional Exposure: Opportunities to support or collaborate with teams outside Seller Experience, such as Platform, Fulfillment, or Buyer Experience, depending on project scope.
Path to Seniority: Clear growth path toward a Senior Data Analyst role or hybrid Product-Data role, depending on profile and performance.
Professional Development: Access to training resources, cross-team learning, and potential mentorship by senior analysts in the centralized Data & AI function.


This role is ideal for a data-driven professional who thrives in fast-paced, product-focused environments and wants to make a real impact on how sellers interact with one of the largest eCommerce platforms in the region. The Data Analyst – Seller Experience will work at the intersection of user behavior, product strategy, and performance optimization, turning complex data into simple, actionable insights.

We value structured thinking, proactive collaboration, and a strong sense of ownership. You’ll be part of a team where your input will directly shape what gets built, how it's measured, and how success is defined across multiple product surfaces. You’ll work closely with a diverse mix of product managers, designers, and content teams, and be supported by modern tools and a growing analytics culture.
