About Us

Baobab's mission is to protect SMEs against cyber attacks better.

We rethink Cyber protection for SMEs by integrating Cyber Insurance with preventive cyber security services.

Like the Baobab tree, Baobab stands for security and support in all circumstances. We help our partners, as well as customers, to better understand cyber (risks). We not only focus on remediation after an incident but also reduce the likelihood of such an event.

We are supported by renowned investors such as Project A, and La Famiglia. In Zurich Insurance, we also have a solid partner with whom we have made a dynamic start as a risk carrier in the market.

Why is cyber insurance important for SMEs? Regardless of size, every business has vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit. Just because a company is small doesn't mean it can't be a target of a cyber-attack. The cyber sector is so fast-moving that there is always a residual risk here, which should then be insured.

We believe that diversity in the team makes the company stronger. We do not discriminate on the basis of religion, skin color, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, or disability and welcome applications from all backgrounds. Apply now to become part of our team!

Getreu unserem Motto – People is what makes us us – sind uns deine nachhaltige Ausbildung und Weiterentwicklung, deine ausgeglichene Work-Life-Balance und deine Happiness sehr wichtig. Konkret stellen wir mit 32 Urlaubstagen, 60 % mobilem Arbeiten, bis zu 4 Wochen pro Jahr – im europäischen Ausland – der Möglichkeit remote zu arbeiten, Sabbatical und Überstundenausgleich sicher, dass dir im FUSE-Agentur-Leben nichts fehlt.

In unserem derzeit über 60-köpfigen Team sowie unseren Kund*innen haben wir unser perfektes Match bereits gefunden. Wenn du noch auf der Suche bist, bei „popkulturellem Relevanzmarketing“ neugierig wirst und für Social Media, Influencer Marketing oder Gaming & Esports brennst, dann lass uns zusammen loslegen! Denn : Action Creates Impact .

Dein Job

Als (Junior) Insights Analyst (mensch) bearbeitest du als Teil unseres Data und Analytics Teams in erster Linie die Anfragen unserer Kunden nach Social Media Reportings sowie Social Listening Analysen und beherrschst den Spagat zwischen analytischem und kreativem Denken, um die Kolleg:Innen in deinem und anderen Teams mit datenbasierten Insights zu Kundenmeinungen, Märkten, Zielgruppen, Marken und ihren Social Media-Umfeldern zu versorgen.

Dein Aufgabenbereich

Datenbeschaffung / Toolbedienung

Du bist präzise, schnell, zuverlässig und motiviert, wenn es um die manuelle Erfassung großer (Social Media)- Datenmengen geht, aber auch wissbegierig und begeisterungsfähig, dich diesbezüglich kontinuierlich mit Prozessoptimierung zu befassen, sowie dich in Tools und automatisierte Datenerfassungsprozesse und Methoden einzudenken, um immer bessere Lösungen zu finden.

Datenstrukturierung, Effiziente Datensammlung, Query Writing, Kategorisierung und Datendarstellung werden hier deine täglichen Begleiter.

Studiendurchführung

Von der (manchmal noch recht schwammigen) Fragestellung bis zum fertigen Analysebericht mit guten Insights und Handlungsempfehlungen ist es oft ein weiter aber spannender Weg. Der kann bald auch deiner sein, gemeinsam mit uns im Team.

Du hast ein sehr gutes Gespür für Sprache und Kommunikation? Nice, das brauchst du hier in mindestens dreierlei Hinsicht: Erstens, um aus den Aussagen und Briefings unserer Auftraggeber herausfiltern zu können, wie du ihnen am besten weiterhelfen kannst. Zweitens, wenn es darum geht, die Essenz von Konsumenten-Posts und Kommentaren auf Social Media zu verstehen, schließlich ist Inhaltanalyse unser Daily-Business. Und Drittens, um dann Deine Findings Zielgruppengerecht rüberzubringen - in Reports, in Meetings und bei Präsentationen.

Datenanalyse

Auswertungslogiken passend zu den gegebenen Fragestellungen und Erkenntnisinteressen erstellen, Dimensionierungen & Kategorisierungen für Inhaltsanalysen planen und entwickeln, Daten auszählen, filtern, darstellen, vergleichen, interpretieren, daraus kreative Idee und Empfehlungen ableiten. Das ist dein Playground. Deine Affinität zu Zahlen und Daten kannst du hier immer wieder beweisen. Ein stets strukturiertes Vorgehen und ein souveräner Umgang auch mit großen und komplexen Datenmengen, Statistiken und Zahlen sind für dich selbstverständlich.

Spezielle Social Media Analyse-Tools wirst Du ebenso (kennenlernen und) zum Einsatz bringen wie ganz viel Excel und das gute alte Powerpoint.

Das bringst du mit

Du kannst (erste) Erfahrung in der qualitativen und quantitativen Forschungsarbeit, sowie in der marketing- oder kundenorientierten Projektarbeit vorweisen und hast Lust dich im Bereich Social Media Analytics weiter auszutoben. Du hast, dank deines Studiums, einen kommunikations-, sozial- oder medienwissenschaftlichen Background und bringst Kenntnisse der Methoden im Bereich der quantitativen und qualitativen Marktforschung mit. Du hast neben den analytischen Fähigkeiten, auch ein Gespür für gute kreative Kommunikation und Lust, diese mitzuentwickeln. Du bist organisiert und selbständig, willst aber auch noch ständig ganz viel lernen und verstehst dich als Teamplayer, der immer auf Höhe des Zeitgeists ist und daraus neue Impulse für unsere Teams und Kunden ableitet. Außerdem hast Du sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse in Wort und Schrift, sehr gute MS Office Kenntnisse, insbesondere Excel und PowerPoint und bist im besten Fall mit Analytics Tools im Bereich Social Listening & Web Analytics vertraut.

Darum wir

Als Teil der FUSE erfährst du stets Rückenwind von deinem Team, arbeitest für Kunden - die unsere Werte „BOLD. TRUE. EASY. TOGETHER.“ leben und kannst aktiv Prozesse und Strukturen mitentwickeln. Denn ganz getreu unserem Wert TOGETHER setzen wir auf das Potential im Team. Neben unvergesslichen Events bieten wir dir viel Raum für persönliche und berufliche Weiterentwicklung.

Technologies you’ll use

Working with multiple clients, we are in touch with many technologies, which is truly exciting. We aim to use state-of-the-art technologies while being fully pragmatic (we do not crack a walnut with a sledgehammer). We follow an ELT philosophy and divide the tasks between Data Engineering and Analytics Engineering accordingly.

The Following Technologies Constitute Our Preferred Data Tech Stack


Data Loading
For most clients, we use our own open-source Python library EWAH and Apache Airflow
For simple requests, we work with Fivetran or Stitch
Data Warehousing
For smaller data loads, we mostly use PostgreSQL databases
For larger datasets, we work with Snowflake or BigQuery
Data Transformation
We love to work with data build tool (dbt)

We don’t compromise on equipment - a powerful Laptop, extra screens, and all the tools you need to be effective
We will surround you with great people who love to solve (mostly data) riddles
We believe in efficient working hours rather than long working hours - we focus on the output rather than the input
We learn and share during meetups, lunch & learn sessions and are open for further initiatives
We pay a market-friendly salary and we additionally distribute at least 20% of profits to our employees
We are fast-growing, have technology at our core, yet we do not rely on a VC and operate profitably
We have a great yearly offsite event that brings us all together for a full week, enjoying good food, having a good time, and of course, solving complex data-related tasks solving complex data-related tasks

Salary: The pro-rata starting salary is £53,459, which includes allowances totalling £2,928.

The salary is broken down as £50,531 basic salary, which will increase annually until you reach the top of the scale - £55,103. Plus, a location allowance of £1,928 and a non-pensionable allowance of £1,000.




Location / Hybrid Working:

This role can be based in either Sidcup, Hendon or Bow but there may be a need for you to attend offsite meetings as required by the business. We actively support hybrid working solutions, with the expectation that you will have 2 days working at home.




The Role:

This is your chance to build something from the ground up – and make a national impact.

County Lines is one of the most serious and damaging criminal threats in the UK today – involving the exploitation of children and vulnerable adults, fuelling violence, and stretching across regional and national borders.




We’re building a new data capability to fight back.

These two brand-new Data Analyst roles are your opportunity to shape how the National County Lines Coordination Centre (NCLCC) uses data to target harm, safeguard victims, and inform national policing strategy.




Working within a matrix environment, you’ll sit within the Met’s wider Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) team but work day-to-day under the direction of the County Lines senior leadership.




We’re looking for analysts who won’t wait to be told what data is needed — you’ll spot the gaps, build the models, and surface insights proactively. You’ll be expected to work autonomously, shape your own priorities, and identify what analysis is needed before others realise it.




From building performance dashboards and national threat assessments to creating intelligence-led products that drive enforcement and safeguarding decisions, your work will directly affect how the UK tackles County Lines networks.




What we can offer:

Hybrid working arrangements for a healthy work-life balance
28 days annual leave (excluding public holidays), rising to 33 days after 5 years continuous service
Personal and professional development opportunities
Enrolment with the Met’s employee incentive partner, Edenred, giving access to a range of rewards and incentives
Access to a range of financial products via the Metropolitan Police Trading Service, including preferred credit facilities
Generous family leave for pregnancy, adoption, paternity and shared parental leave
Childcare support including nursery and play scheme discounts
Excellent contributory pension scheme for your financial future
Access to the Bluelight Emergency Services discount card with a range of official discounts from large national retailers to local businesses including holidays, cars, days out, fashion, gifts, insurance, phones and much more
A substantial range of health and wellbeing benefits including physiotherapy, 24/7 rehabilitation services and free eye tests
To promote physical well-being you will have full access to subsidised sports centre membership to over 3,000 UK gyms and 80 London Fitness Centres. There is also an excellent range of sporting activities on offer through the various Met Police Sports and Social Clubs.




What you will be doing

This Role Isn’t Just About Reporting – It’s About Leading with Data

Build and manage new data pipelines and dashboards from national systems like PND and APMIS
Develop analytics that help answer urgent questions: Are interventions reducing harm? Where is exploitation spiking?
Design and deliver new performance reports to support NCLCC strategy and Home Office accountability
Create clear, impactful visuals and briefings for senior policing and government partners
Work independently but collaboratively – owning your roadmap, yet sharing and evolving ideas with the wider DDaT analyst community
Help set the foundations of a new capability: what you build now will shape this function for years to come




Essential skills:

You have a solid background in data analysis, ideally from a STEM degree or equivalent experience
You’re fluent in SQL, Excel, and Power BI or Tableau – and confident working with large, often messy datasets
You’re comfortable with ambiguity and excited by the opportunity to define your own workload
You’ve got strong judgement and know how to prioritise what’s urgent, important – or both
You can communicate complex ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences
Ideally, you’ve worked with government, law enforcement, or in another high-stakes data environment
Familiarity with Azure, POLE databases, or Python is a plus




Security Clearance:

Due to the secure nature of our work, successful candidates must pass all vetting and security requirements, which for this role means Vetting Clearance is Force Clearance Level, Recruitment Vetting (RV), and National Security Vetting (NSV) Level, Counter Terrorism Check (CTC).




Mets Vetting process and charter:

More details relating to UK Security Clearance can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-security-vetting




We view diversity as fundamental to our success. To tackle today’s complex policing challenges, we welcome applications from all of our London communities.

What You'll Do


Take ownership of our management of customers who are struggling with their payments
Deep dive investigations into data in order to surface insight for decision making
Develop our reporting suite through the latest BI tools & technology stack
Develop our empathic approaches towards vulnerable customers
Create strategies to identify and prevent first party and third party fraud
Develop our machine learning models & policies that drive sophisticated decisions
Proactively identify new areas of opportunity
Challenge the status quo in terms of KPIs, objectives & strategy
Communicate complex data concepts effectively and confidently
Build great relationships with Data Science, Technology, Finance, Collections, Ops and other stakeholders

DBT
2-5 years experience of consumer credit risk or collections in the financial services, utilities or telecommunications industries

Contract: Permanent, Full-time (36 hours per week)

Salary: £37,007 - £38,821 (inclusive of London Weighting)

Benefits: 28 days holiday plus public holidays, Local Government Pension Scheme, Cycle to Work scheme, Employee Assistance Programme

About Us – West London Waste Authority (WLWA)

WLWA is a statutory public body responsible for managing waste disposal for six London boroughs: Brent, Ealing, Harrow, Hillingdon, Hounslow and Richmond upon Thames. Working on behalf of over 1.7 million residents, we manage the treatment, transfer and disposal of waste and recycling that local councils collect.

We coordinate complex waste operations, liaise with multiple contractors and public sector partners, and deliver environmental services with a focus on efficiency and sustainability. As the sector becomes more data-driven, we are investing in the way we collect, manage and use information across borough boundaries.

Make Public Sector Data Work Better Across Borough Boundaries

To support this transformation, we're looking for a Data & Business Intelligence Analyst (internally known as “MI Analyst”) who can work confidently at the intersection of data, systems and people.

This role is for someone who can build robust, insightful reports — while also working collaboratively across boroughs, finance teams and contractors to align data capture and reporting.

This is a delivery-focused position with the opportunity to shape how information flows between organisations and influences operational, financial and environmental decision-making.

What You'll Do


Design, build and maintain automated dashboards and reporting tools using Power BI, DAX, Power Query, and SQL
Gather, validate and integrate data from boroughs and contractors, ensuring consistency and quality
Support statutory data returns (e.g. Waste Data Flow) and produce management and financial reports
Investigate discrepancies, spot data issues early, and engage constructively with partners to resolve them
Collaborate closely with internal colleagues and external stakeholders to deliver improvements in reporting accuracy, usability and efficiency
Provide mentoring and task oversight to the MI Assistant to ensure consistent data practices across the team.


The Environment You'll Be Working In

This role spans multiple organisations with differing systems and priorities. It requires a proactive, analytical approach — and the ability to build trust and shared understanding across stakeholders.


You'll need to communicate clearly, work interactively with others, and respond effectively to requests and issues as they arise.
The role involves real-time collaboration and engagement as part of day-to-day delivery, especially when resolving data queries or aligning reporting practices.


Essential Skills And Experience


Proven experience using Power BI, including DAX, Power Query, and data modelling techniques
Strong skills in SQL or T-SQL for transforming, cleansing and integrating data
Experience working with large, complex datasets from multiple sources
Ability to identify, explain and resolve data issues through direct engagement with stakeholders
Evidence you can drive a data issue to resolution – e.g. persuading a partner to correct their feed, coaching non-technical colleagues, or thrashing it out on a live call until the numbers balance.
Experience working in a setting where cross-organisational collaboration or partner engagement was key to delivery


Highly Desirable Experience working in or with local government or public sector data.


Understanding of environmental or waste management data
Familiarity with statutory data submission processes or financial reconciliation reporting
Hands-on data-engineering capability, ideally including: Designing and building a lakehouse architecture, Implementing Azure access-management controls, Setting up row-level security for Power BI reports


Why Join WLWA?

We're a small, mission-driven organisation with wide reach and big ambitions. You'll work in a role that combines technical hands-on data work with the chance to improve public services across six London boroughs.

We Offer


28 days annual leave plus public holidays
Membership of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS)
Opportunities to lead on meaningful improvements in data processes and reporting
A varied, cross-organisational working environment with real-world impact


Apply Now

We welcome applications from all backgrounds and actively encourage people who bring diverse perspectives to apply. If you can combine strong technical skills with the ability to build relationships, explain complexity clearly, and drive improvement across varied stakeholders — we want to hear from you.

We are committed to creating an inclusive, diverse workplace and welcome applications from all backgrounds.

What You'll Do


Take ownership of our management of customers who are struggling with their payments
Deep dive investigations into data in order to surface insight for decision making
Develop our reporting suite through the latest BI tools & technology stack
Develop our empathic approaches towards vulnerable customers
Create strategies to identify and prevent first party and third party fraud
Develop our machine learning models & policies that drive sophisticated decisions
Proactively identify new areas of opportunity

Python data science stack (pandas, NumPy, Jupyter notebooks, Plotly/matplotlib, etc)
Familiarity with Git
Data visualization tool (Tableau, Looker, PowerBI or equivalent)

2-5 years experience of consumer credit risk or collections in the financial services, utilities or telecommunications industries

Contract: Permanent, Full-time (36 hours per week)

Salary: £37,007 - £38,821 (inclusive of London Weighting)

Benefits: 28 days holiday plus public holidays, Local Government Pension Scheme, Cycle to Work scheme, Employee Assistance Programme

About Us – West London Waste Authority (WLWA)

WLWA is a statutory public body responsible for managing waste disposal for six London boroughs: Brent, Ealing, Harrow, Hillingdon, Hounslow and Richmond upon Thames. Working on behalf of over 1.7 million residents, we manage the treatment, transfer and disposal of waste and recycling that local councils collect.

We coordinate complex waste operations, liaise with multiple contractors and public sector partners, and deliver environmental services with a focus on efficiency and sustainability. As the sector becomes more data-driven, we are investing in the way we collect, manage and use information across borough boundaries.

Make Public Sector Data Work Better Across Borough Boundaries

To support this transformation, we're looking for a Data & Business Intelligence Analyst (internally known as “MI Analyst”) who can work confidently at the intersection of data, systems and people.

This role is for someone who can build robust, insightful reports — while also working collaboratively across boroughs, finance teams and contractors to align data capture and reporting.

This is a delivery-focused position with the opportunity to shape how information flows between organisations and influences operational, financial and environmental decision-making.

What You'll Do


Design, build and maintain automated dashboards and reporting tools using Power BI, DAX, Power Query, and SQL
Gather, validate and integrate data from boroughs and contractors, ensuring consistency and quality
Support statutory data returns (e.g. Waste Data Flow) and produce management and financial reports
Investigate discrepancies, spot data issues early, and engage constructively with partners to resolve them
Collaborate closely with internal colleagues and external stakeholders to deliver improvements in reporting accuracy, usability and efficiency
Provide mentoring and task oversight to the MI Assistant to ensure consistent data practices across the team.


The Environment You'll Be Working In

This role spans multiple organisations with differing systems and priorities. It requires a proactive, analytical approach — and the ability to build trust and shared understanding across stakeholders.


You'll need to communicate clearly, work interactively with others, and respond effectively to requests and issues as they arise.
The role involves real-time collaboration and engagement as part of day-to-day delivery, especially when resolving data queries or aligning reporting practices.


Essential Skills And Experience


Proven experience using Power BI, including DAX, Power Query, and data modelling techniques
Strong skills in SQL or T-SQL for transforming, cleansing and integrating data
Experience working with large, complex datasets from multiple sources
Ability to identify, explain and resolve data issues through direct engagement with stakeholders
Evidence you can drive a data issue to resolution – e.g. persuading a partner to correct their feed, coaching non-technical colleagues, or thrashing it out on a live call until the numbers balance.
Experience working in a setting where cross-organisational collaboration or partner engagement was key to delivery


Highly Desirable Experience working in or with local government or public sector data.

That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Senior Associate, Data Analyst

Our Capital One DA Team.

Data is at the center of everything we do. It started in 1988, when we launched as a startup with the goal of using data to deliver personalized credit card products. Fast-forward a few years — we’re a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Data Analyst on our team, you’ll be curious enough to ask questions and brave enough to blurt out a cool idea. You approach problems with creativity, and you love exploring new ways of doing things. But most importantly, you enjoy collaborating, and you’re always willing to share your knowledge with your peers — because you know that’s how the best ideas are made.

Working with us

How do we do things at Capital One Canada? We listen — to our people, and to our customers. We change with the times and have adopted a flexible hybrid model. A flexible hybrid working model is one that creates the opportunity to match the work that we do to the environment that best supports that work. Associates working in the hybrid model are expected to come into the office 3 days a week across Tuesdays and Thursdays, reserving Mondays and Fridays as company-wide virtual days. As was true before the pandemic, expectations of being in the office will be balanced with personal life flexibility.

At Capital One we’re committed to diversity, inclusion and belonging. We strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and inclusive behaviours are embedded in everything we do to positively impact associates. Strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and to help challenge the status quo and create the best outcomes for everyone.

We’re focused on helping associates live well—physically, financially and emotionally. When you join us, we support you and those who are most important to you, offering full coverage for spouses, domestic partners, and dependents. We’ve designed our benefits program to be flexible, comprehensive and consistent across our organization. From health and fitness center discounts, to training and professional development programs—and much more—you’ll discover that Capital One is committed to helping you live your best life.

Here are some examples of projects that you may work on as a Senior Data Analyst:


Build, automate, and maintain critical business reporting using cutting-edge tools.

A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database or an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, QuickSight, Tableau, etc.).
Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.
Collaborative: You’re able to work with teammates with diverse skill sets and explain your work to less technical audiences.

Senior Associate, Data Analyst

Our Capital One DA Team.

Data is at the center of everything we do. It started in 1988, when we launched as a startup with the goal of using data to deliver personalized credit card products. Fast-forward a few years — we’re a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Data Analyst on our team, you’ll be curious enough to ask questions and brave enough to blurt out a cool idea. You approach problems with creativity, and you love exploring new ways of doing things. But most importantly, you enjoy collaborating, and you’re always willing to share your knowledge with your peers — because you know that’s how the best ideas are made.

Working with us

How do we do things at Capital One Canada? We listen — to our people, and to our customers. We change with the times and have adopted a flexible hybrid model. A flexible hybrid working model is one that creates the opportunity to match the work that we do to the environment that best supports that work. Associates working in the hybrid model are expected to come into the office 3 days a week across Tuesdays and Thursdays, reserving Mondays and Fridays as company-wide virtual days. As was true before the pandemic, expectations of being in the office will be balanced with personal life flexibility.

At Capital One we’re committed to diversity, inclusion and belonging. We strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and inclusive behaviours are embedded in everything we do to positively impact associates. Strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and to help challenge the status quo and create the best outcomes for everyone.

We’re focused on helping associates live well—physically, financially and emotionally. When you join us, we support you and those who are most important to you, offering full coverage for spouses, domestic partners, and dependents. We’ve designed our benefits program to be flexible, comprehensive and consistent across our organization. From health and fitness center discounts, to training and professional development programs—and much more—you’ll discover that Capital One is committed to helping you live your best life.

Here are some examples of projects that you may work on as a Senior Data Analyst:


Build, automate, and maintain critical business reporting using cutting-edge tools.
Write SQL to clean, transform, investigate, and augment large, complex database tables
Work closely with business partners to make sure our business strategy is as data driven as possible
Design and implement rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas to customers or company leaders
Ensure data and intent integrity by automating data quality verification
Support and consult with the business to propagate data management best practices
Create and maintain well-managed critical data processes to meet regulatory requirements.
Identify process improvements and deliver on them.
Perform ad hoc analytics on large/diverse datasets.


We want you to be one of us if you are:


Curious: You ask why, you explore, and you’re not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You know SQL and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.
A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database or an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, QuickSight, Tableau, etc.).
Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.
Collaborative: You’re able to work with teammates with diverse skill sets and explain your work to less technical audiences.


Basic Qualifications:


Bachelor's Degree
At least 2 years of experience with SQL
At least 1 year of experience with Unix or equivalent
At least 1 year of experience with version control systems like GitHub.

CONSEQUENCE OF ERROR

The Scheduling BDA is a representative of ES and liaises with ES staff and various members of the university community including UBC IT, faculties and service units. This is a highly visible position, which has continuous contact with Enrolment Services staff and a very diverse university and public community. Projects coordinated by the incumbent will directly impact faculty, staff and student relationships with UBC and the outside community.

Failure to adequately involve stakeholders could result in ineffective design of reports to support business operations or the ineffective use of available reports resulting in unnecessary work by faculty, staff and administrators. The success of these projects directly impacts the recruitment, retention, and administration of students at both UBCV and UBCO and service delivery levels by faculty, staff and administrators. A thorough understanding pertaining to privacy legislation, policies and data security is required to adequately ensure the appropriate levels of security are met. Unless adequate management and monitoring take place, the integrity of the security of the SIS and student records would be jeopardized resulting in non-compliance and negative legal and reputational consequences for the University.

This position also carries responsibility for facilitating the testing of new and existing reports. A thorough understanding of the scheduling software (i.e Scientia) and Student Information System's complex data structure and definitions are required to adequately identify possible problems. Unless adequate testing takes place, problems can occur once in production, again reflecting negatively on Enrolment Services and, ultimately, the University's customers and clients.

SUPERVISION RECEIVED

Reports to the Associate Director, Scheduling Services. Works independently with minimal supervision. Exercises initiative and sound judgment in making decisions. Works in collaboration with other senior University staff.
