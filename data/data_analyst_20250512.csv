About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Payment Intelligence Engineering’s purpose is to mitigate threats to our systems in order to keep our merchants, Stripe and financial partners safe. We empower global businesses with intelligent solutions for conversion and fraud prevention, leveraging consumer intelligence and transparent ML to maximize growth and build trust. Our Payments Intelligence portfolio delivers actionable insights to all user segments.

The Payments Health Technical Operations team is pioneering new ways to achieve this mission. Our dynamic team relies on the expertise of integration reliability engineers and data analysts to identify gaps and build comprehensive solutions in the ever changing arena of fraud prevention.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and maintain SQL queries to analyze and navigate complex financial data effectively.
Enhance overall observability by identifying gaps and proposing actionable insights to improve our monitoring systems.
Actively hunt for patterns and anomalies in data that could indicate potential threats or operational issues.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to consolidate and gather relevant data for informed engineering efforts.
Design and implement comprehensive dashboards for real-time visibility into key metrics and system health.
Establish and refine key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress and improvements over time.
Support the creation and maintenance of observability frameworks to ensure early detection of issues.
Contribute to efforts that reduce organizational toil by optimizing data analysis processes.
Communicate findings and insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Stay updated with industry trends in data analysis and financial data handling to ensure best practices.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have 5+ years of experience in Payments at a leading technology or payments company
Have experience writing SQL to query relational databases
Have experience managing communications and workflows with technical and non-technical teams across internal and external stakeholders
Experience mentoring junior team members in technical skill development, operational strategy and problem solving
Have experience navigating the nuanced complexity of financial systems and solving large scale, technical challenges
Have strong financial modeling and analytical skills to investigate, prioritize, and identify the root cause of issues
Have experience managing multiple, concurrent work streams, identifying and triaging technical issues and driving solutions with clear metrics to show impact



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,400 - $219,600. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Payment Intelligence Engineering’s purpose is to mitigate threats to our systems in order to keep our merchants, Stripe and financial partners safe. We empower global businesses with intelligent solutions for conversion and fraud prevention, leveraging consumer intelligence and transparent ML to maximize growth and build trust. Our Payments Intelligence portfolio delivers actionable insights to all user segments.

The Payments Health Technical Operations team is pioneering new ways to achieve this mission. Our dynamic team relies on the expertise of integration reliability engineers and data analysts to identify gaps and build comprehensive solutions in the ever changing arena of fraud prevention.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Develop and maintain SQL queries to analyze and navigate complex financial data effectively.
Enhance overall observability by identifying gaps and proposing actionable insights to improve our monitoring systems.
Actively hunt for patterns and anomalies in data that could indicate potential threats or operational issues.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to consolidate and gather relevant data for informed engineering efforts.
Design and implement comprehensive dashboards for real-time visibility into key metrics and system health.
Establish and refine key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress and improvements over time.
Support the creation and maintenance of observability frameworks to ensure early detection of issues.
Contribute to efforts that reduce organizational toil by optimizing data analysis processes.
Communicate findings and insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Stay updated with industry trends in data analysis and financial data handling to ensure best practices.



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have 5+ years of experience in Payments at a leading technology or payments company
Have experience writing SQL to query relational databases
Have experience managing communications and workflows with technical and non-technical teams across internal and external stakeholders
Experience mentoring junior team members in technical skill development, operational strategy and problem solving
Have experience navigating the nuanced complexity of financial systems and solving large scale, technical challenges
Have strong financial modeling and analytical skills to investigate, prioritize, and identify the root cause of issues
Have experience managing multiple, concurrent work streams, identifying and triaging technical issues and driving solutions with clear metrics to show impact



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,400 - $219,600. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Location: Remote or Los Angeles




Type: Contract or Full-Time (Flexible)




At Owl & Co, we help media and tech companies figure out what really drives attention, engagement—and ultimately—value.

We’re looking for a sharp, curious Data Analyst to help us spot the value-creating patterns others overlook. Sometimes they’re hiding in plain sight. Sometimes they’re buried in a 10,000-row spreadsheet. Sometimes they live in a private database we subscribe to, but you need to know where to look.




What’s in it for you?




You’ll be the first hire at Owl & Co, the consulting firm started by Hernan Lopez (founder of Wondery, former CEO of Fox International Channels). You’ll get a front-row seat to where the puck is going across media and tech. And you’ll get to move comfortably between the 10,000-foot view and the spreadsheet-level detail—and know when to zoom in or out.




You might be a fit if:




You love puzzles, patterns, and asking the second question
You’ve worked with large, messy data sets (Excel a must, SQL, Python, a plus)
You’re as comfortable with pivot tables as you are questioning assumptions
You think like an analyst but write (and talk) like a human
Your AI skills are up-to-date and constantly evolving
You’ve worked in—or are fascinated by—media, tech or consumer trends (especially streaming in TV, film, music, podcasts, YouTube, the Creator Economy, or subscription businesses)




Whether you have a degree in data science, economics or none at all, you should be fluent in data, love TV, Film, music, YouTube and/or podcasts, and driven by curiosity.




Bonus points if:




You’ve built models that explain or predict behavior
You’ve worked in consulting, VC, or with startups
You can quickly ""code-switch"" between large English-language markets and places like Brazil, Japan, or South Korea
You can chart things using PowerPoint in a way that makes people go “ohhhhhh”




Compensation:




Pay will depend on several factors—your location, whether you’re looking for full-time or contract, exclusivity, and competitive market data. In all cases, work will be subject to strict NDAs.




If you decide to apply, you will be asked to put your sleuthing, data analysis, AI skills to the test on the next page. If you want to stand out, you can also send your resume to contact [at] owlandco.com, including (a) relevant work in the space you have authored and (b) how you arrived at the answers to the test questions, and how long it took you.

We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have a true love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem and living inside a spreadsheet or data set to find the answer to any question.
You have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization tools, and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis.
Experience with Marketing APIs, BigQuery or other cloud data warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks), ETL tools (such as Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics), and/or Python is a plus.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and at least 1 year of experience working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.

What You’ll Do:




Reporting:

Maintain customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence.
Use Advanced Excel, SQL, and Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools to generate pivot tables and other visualizations summarizing thousands of lines of data.
Translate performance media metrics into clear, digestible reports for client advertising campaigns.
Communicate insights effectively through Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.




Strategy:

Learn our clients’ businesses and align media strategy with their business goals.
Analyze advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to guide media buying strategy.
Apply your background in paid media and/or digital advertising, including understanding concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue.
Engage in discussions with clients to build trust and gain stakeholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.

Pearl Health is powering the future of healthcare. We help primary care providers and organizations to deliver quality healthcare to the patients who need it most, when they need it most — and get rewarded for keeping patients healthy.

Our technology, services, and financial tools enable better, more proactive care, decrease total cost of care across patient panels, and optimize performance in value-based care models for Traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage.

We are a team of physicians and public health experts (Stanford, Harvard, Mount Sinai), technologists (athenahealth, Amazon, Meta, Flatiron), healthcare innovators (Centivo, Aledade, Stellar, Arcadia), and experienced risk management professionals (CVS/Aetna, Humana, Oscar) who believe that primary care providers are the key to addressing our healthcare system’s biggest challenges.

Since its founding in 2020, Pearl has expanded to partner with thousands of primary care providers in practices and organizations across 44 states. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Viking Global Investors, AlleyCorp, and SV Angel.

Manage ambiguity while working with cross-functional teams on complex projects, with a focus on defining data requirements, developing analytical models, and interpreting results.
Partner with Data Engineering and Product to create end-to-end data pipelines that turn raw data into actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.
Contribute to the development of the data analytics roadmap and strategy by collaborating with leadership in the Data Science and Analytics organization to identify opportunities and propose technical and business-level solutions with a medium-term (1-2 year) time horizon.
Evaluate new data technologies and tools (including data warehouses, orchestration systems, and BI tools) to enhance the team's capabilities.
Mentor other data analysts, providing guidance on analytical techniques and best practices.
Help your manager establish standards, design guidelines, and SOPs for analytical workflows, e.g., dashboard development, EDA, and ingestion of new datasets.


Who You Are...

We are a team of physicians and public health experts (Stanford, Harvard, Mount Sinai), technologists (athenahealth, Amazon, Meta, Flatiron), healthcare innovators (Centivo, Aledade, Stellar, Arcadia), and experienced risk management professionals (CVS/Aetna, Humana, Oscar) who believe that primary care providers are the key to addressing our healthcare system’s biggest challenges.

Since its founding in 2020, Pearl has expanded to partner with thousands of primary care providers in practices and organizations across 44 states. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Viking Global Investors, AlleyCorp, and SV Angel.

Manage ambiguity while working with cross-functional teams on complex projects, with a focus on defining data requirements, developing analytical models, and interpreting results.
Partner with Data Engineering and Product to create end-to-end data pipelines that turn raw data into actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.

Evaluate new data technologies and tools (including data warehouses, orchestration systems, and BI tools) to enhance the team's capabilities.
Mentor other data analysts, providing guidance on analytical techniques and best practices.
Help your manager establish standards, design guidelines, and SOPs for analytical workflows, e.g., dashboard development, EDA, and ingestion of new datasets.
