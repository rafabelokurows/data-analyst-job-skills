About Us

Baobab's mission is to protect SMEs against cyber attacks better.

We rethink Cyber protection for SMEs by integrating Cyber Insurance with preventive cyber security services.

Like the Baobab tree, Baobab stands for security and support in all circumstances. We help our partners, as well as customers, to better understand cyber (risks). We not only focus on remediation after an incident but also reduce the likelihood of such an event.

We are supported by renowned investors such as Project A, and La Famiglia. In Zurich Insurance, we also have a solid partner with whom we have made a dynamic start as a risk carrier in the market.

Why is cyber insurance important for SMEs? Regardless of size, every business has vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit. Just because a company is small doesn't mean it can't be a target of a cyber-attack. The cyber sector is so fast-moving that there is always a residual risk here, which should then be insured.

We believe that diversity in the team makes the company stronger. We do not discriminate on the basis of religion, skin color, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, or disability and welcome applications from all backgrounds. Apply now to become part of our team!

Salary: Up to £50,000 plus generous package




Location: London, Hybrid (3 days per week onsite)




Position: Permanent







I'm partnered with an ambitious and fast-growing wealth management group, backed by private equity and actively expanding through strategic acquisitions. This is a business that combines the agility of a scale-up with the backing and stability of a well-capitalised, established firm. Their modular approach to wealth services has positioned them as a major disruptor in the UK financial services space.




As part of this transformation journey, they are looking to bring on a Data Analyst - a key strategic and operational role reporting into the CTO. This role sits at the heart of technology operations and is instrumental in shaping how data is used to drive decisions, monitor performance, and deliver operational excellence across the technology function.




This isn’t a traditional back-office data role. You’ll act as the connective tissue between the CTO, Finance, Delivery, and other leadership teams, helping to ensure that data is consistently driving smarter decisions and strategic alignment.




What You’ll Be Doing:

Designing and maintaining executive dashboards that provide visibility into financials, supplier performance, risk, delivery metrics, and workforce analytics
Leading budget tracking, cost control, and forecasting within the technology function
Managing vendor data, including contract renewals, reviews, and supplier KPIs
Monitoring and reporting on operational and technology risks, security vulnerabilities, and audit items
Aggregating Agile delivery metrics and reporting progress against forecasted business benefits
Supporting governance and prioritisation processes with high-quality data and analysis
Acting as a liaison across key stakeholders, ensuring alignment and structured decision-making
Identifying and driving improvements across operational workflows




Skills and Qualifications:

Experience in a technology operations, business management, or data-driven strategy role
Financial experience across budgeting, variance analysis, and cost tracking; ideally with an accounting qualification (CIMA, ACCA, ACA) or equivalent experience
Excellent proficiency with data analytics tools - particularly Power BI and Excel
Deep understanding of IT operations, supplier management, and risk frameworks
Familiarity with Agile delivery principles and project performance tracking
Confident communicator, comfortable working with senior stakeholders and across departments
Ability to turn complex data into clear, actionable insight




Perks (to name a few):

Attractive employee pension scheme
25 days annual leave + public holidays + office Christmas close (3 days)
Buy and sell holidays up to 5 days
Private medical insurance, group life insurance, and income protection insurance
Discretionary performance-related bonus




This is a rare opportunity to join a business in high-growth mode, where you’ll be empowered to shape how data drives performance and technology strategy from the inside out. If this sounds like your kind of challenge, don't hesitate to apply!

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

YOUR ROLE

In the Data Analytics team you will ensure both the voice of the customer and CFO are represented in the room with hard evidence.

Your experience with web and social analytics tools (GA / Adobe / Brandwatch / Sprinklr) and data visualisation tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker / etc) will enable you to uncover key insights across channels and create self-service dashboards.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

Associates support the Delivery team with data analysis projects for clients in the financial services industry with a focus across areas such as Asset & Wealth Management, Corporate and Investment Banking, and Commercial Banking. The role involves handling and examining large data sets, and using these to share benchmarking insights with clients to help improve their efficiency and business performance.




Associates are encouraged to take responsibility for their own deliverables ranging from periodic benchmarking activities to bespoke client projects and industry roundtables. Additionally, they may assist with the management of client accounts and support the development of internal initiatives such as knowledge sharing groups, process improvements or organising social activities.




While oversight is provided by senior team members, Expand’s culture puts emphasis on personal ownership from the very start of your career. Associates get involved in all aspects of the delivery lifecycle, from sales through to initial data collection, thorough analysis, visualisation and communication of the findings to the client. In addition to allowing you to see the results of your work, this provides a great deal of diversity on the job and enables you to develop broad business skills and knowledge. As you progress you will have an increasing level of direct client exposure, which in many cases reaches C-level executives. Experienced Associates also get involved with BCG cases in addition to our direct client work, providing exposure to high-level stakeholders within our parent-company.




We are looking for proactive, curious and diligent individuals: analytical and articulate problem solvers who, with clear instruction, will play a large part in the delivery process. The role involves learning and increasing business knowledge and technical skills quickly, with the resulting opportunity to progress internally and take on more responsibility as your knowledge grows.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We are funded by the best investors in the world including:

a16z, Sequoia, PayPal, Binance Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Uniswap Labs, Circle Ventures, Delphi Digital, and many more.

Leveraging and expanding our ever-growing Kimball dimensional model.
Writing SQL to create and expand insights in our in-house reporting solutions.

Compose pipelines by writing SQL code to clean, combine, refine, and aggregate data into the insights the organization needs.
Collaborating on new datasets to ingest into our Snowflake data warehouse, working closely with data engineers on your team.
Not afraid of pushing code that supports tens of billions of dollars in daily transaction volume.


About You

We are looking for someone with previous data analyst experience. Likely with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Physics or related field, but we also consider and highly value equivalent practical experience.

Required


Strong SQL knowledge and experience
Proven track record in data modeling, statistics, and analytics
Experience working with a broad range of stakeholders
Strong convictions weakly held.
You enjoy working in a fast-paced start-up environment, where you'll need to take initiative and solve problems independently.

Experience with Snowflake
Experience building DAG based data pipelines
Experience with streaming real-time data pipelines

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources
Define and monitor key economic impact metrics
Go deep on understanding business drivers, user segments, cohorts and macroeconomic trends
Prepare presentations, analyses and visualizations for internal and external executive audiences
Partner closely with Communications, Policy, Marketing and Product teams to identify and analyze key trends and produce thought leadership pieces and campaign content leveraging Stripe data
Collaborate with external vendors, academics, and think tanks to advance Stripe’s research agenda and advocacy positions



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.<br><br><strong>About The Team<br><br></strong>We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally.

This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.<br><br>A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office.

Compose pipelines by writing SQL code to clean, combine, refine, and aggregate data into the insights the organization needs.
Collaborating on new datasets to ingest into our Snowflake data warehouse, working closely with data engineers on your team.
Not afraid of pushing code that supports tens of billions of dollars in daily transaction volume.


About You

We are looking for someone with previous data analyst experience. Likely with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Physics or related field, but we also consider and highly value equivalent practical experience.

Required


Strong SQL knowledge and experience
Proven track record in data modeling, statistics, and analytics
Experience working with a broad range of stakeholders
Strong convictions weakly held.
You enjoy working in a fast-paced start-up environment, where you'll need to take initiative and solve problems independently.

Experience with Snowflake
Experience building DAG based data pipelines
Experience with streaming real-time data pipelines

Senior Associate, Data Analyst

Our Capital One DA Team.

Data is at the center of everything we do. It started in 1988, when we launched as a startup with the goal of using data to deliver personalized credit card products. Fast-forward a few years — we’re a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Data Analyst on our team, you’ll be curious enough to ask questions and brave enough to blurt out a cool idea. You approach problems with creativity, and you love exploring new ways of doing things. But most importantly, you enjoy collaborating, and you’re always willing to share your knowledge with your peers — because you know that’s how the best ideas are made.

Working with us

How do we do things at Capital One Canada? We listen — to our people, and to our customers. We change with the times and have adopted a flexible hybrid model. A flexible hybrid working model is one that creates the opportunity to match the work that we do to the environment that best supports that work. Associates working in the hybrid model are expected to come into the office 3 days a week across Tuesdays and Thursdays, reserving Mondays and Fridays as company-wide virtual days. As was true before the pandemic, expectations of being in the office will be balanced with personal life flexibility.

At Capital One we’re committed to diversity, inclusion and belonging. We strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and inclusive behaviours are embedded in everything we do to positively impact associates. Strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and to help challenge the status quo and create the best outcomes for everyone.

We’re focused on helping associates live well—physically, financially and emotionally. When you join us, we support you and those who are most important to you, offering full coverage for spouses, domestic partners, and dependents. We’ve designed our benefits program to be flexible, comprehensive and consistent across our organization. From health and fitness center discounts, to training and professional development programs—and much more—you’ll discover that Capital One is committed to helping you live your best life.

Here are some examples of projects that you may work on as a Senior Data Analyst:


Build, automate, and maintain critical business reporting using cutting-edge tools.
Write SQL to clean, transform, investigate, and augment large, complex database tables
Work closely with business partners to make sure our business strategy is as data driven as possible
Design and implement rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas to customers or company leaders
Ensure data and intent integrity by automating data quality verification
Support and consult with the business to propagate data management best practices
Create and maintain well-managed critical data processes to meet regulatory requirements.
Identify process improvements and deliver on them.
Perform ad hoc analytics on large/diverse datasets.


We want you to be one of us if you are:


Curious: You ask why, you explore, and you’re not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You know SQL and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.
A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database or an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, QuickSight, Tableau, etc.).
Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.
Collaborative: You’re able to work with teammates with diverse skill sets and explain your work to less technical audiences.


Basic Qualifications:


Bachelor's Degree
At least 2 years of experience with SQL
At least 1 year of experience with Unix or equivalent

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Join our team as we create a world of stories and knowledge, democratize the exchange of ideas and information, and empower collective expertise through our three products: Everand, Scribd, and Slideshare.

We support a culture where our employees can be real and be bold; where we debate and commit as we embrace plot twists; and where every employee is empowered to take action as we prioritize the customer.

When it comes to workplace structure, we believe in balancing individual flexibility and community connections. It’s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees – in partnership with their manager – can choose the daily work-style that best suits their individual needs. A key tenet of Scribd Flex is our prioritization of intentional in-person moments to build collaboration, culture, and connection. For this reason, occasional in-person attendance is required for all Scribd employees, regardless of their location.

So what are we looking for in new team members? Well, we hire for “GRIT”. The textbook definition of GRIT is demonstrating the intersection of passion and perseverance towards long term goals. At Scribd, we are inspired by the potential that this can unlock, and ask each of our employees to pursue a GRIT-ty approach to their work. In a tactical sense, GRIT is also a handy acronym that outlines the standards we hold ourselves and each other to. Here’s what that means for you: we’re looking for someone who showcases the ability to set and achieve Goals, achieve Results within their job responsibilities, contribute Innovative ideas and solutions, and positively influence the broader Team through collaboration and attitude.
