Recidiviz is thrilled to be hiring a Policy Data Analyst to join our team! We're a small, fast-moving group that works with complex criminal justice data from our state partners and develops analyses and tools that target the drivers of incarceration. That's where you come in. We're looking for someone who has attention to detail to improve our analysis, creativity and inquisitiveness to identify and solve open-ended problems, clarity to think through complex and variable data, flexibility to adjust in a rapidly evolving environment, and above all else, a collaborative, kind nature to add to our culture.

About Us

Recidiviz is creating safer, healthier communities by improving outcomes for people in the criminal justice system. We build technology to reduce the number of people in prison and to help criminal justice leaders embrace data-driven decision-making.

Using software tools and thoughtful product design, we've been able to safely and permanently reduce incarceration and improve outcomes. We work side-by-side with leaders of the criminal justice system, people in prison and on supervision, and ecosystem partners to build a better path forward. In addition to the revenue we earn from state partners, some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations support our work.

People who succeed at Recidiviz lead with kindness and humility, assume good intent, learn from failure, and fix problems when they see them. They are excited to work arm in arm with government leadership and staff to improve outcomes. They are great listeners. They build deep relationships with and empathy for the people we work with and the people who our mission serves, even when those two groups feel at odds.

About The Role

Recidiviz's policy team supports state Department of Corrections (DOC) leaders that want to rewrite old policies or implement new ones, rooted in evidence and analytics, to improve outcomes, increase public safety and community health, and drive meaningful changes. We tailor data analysis, built on detailed DOC data, to answer questions like: What combination of criteria best select for probation clients who are safe to discharge? What static factors influence parole decisions today and how would that change if new, dynamic factors were added? How many people would X, Y, or Z adjustment to a policy affect and what can we say about the affected group? By translating concepts into concrete modeling, we help drive smarter and more ambitious change.

This role collaborates across several teams to guide work that targets the drivers of incarceration. Our Policy Data Analysts work with diverse data – criminal justice data both raw and processed from across the country, reports and policy documents from government agencies, and much more – to develop the policy analyses that deepen our understanding of the criminal justice system and motivate policy change. Our Policy Data Analysts translate policy concepts into quantitative metrics, perform analyses, and play a key role in contextualizing and presenting their analyses to stakeholders, both internal and external.

More about Recidiviz

Recidiviz was an all-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we've built an A-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator's 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.

Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) over 18 state partners – big and small, red and blue – and covers more than 40% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners – from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.

An important note

Lasting change is always built on diversity. Recidiviz recruits, employs, trains, compensates and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, veteran status, ancestry, citizenship, marital status, gender identity and all protected status as required by applicable law. We consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you have a special need that requires accommodation, please let us know in your application. Even if you don't think you meet all the criteria above, drop your resume, and we'll take a look – you might be great for another role or another time!

This is a high-impact, hands-on role focused on shaping how enterprise and portfolio data is accessed, prepared, and consumed by quantitative researchers, portfolio managers, and downstream analytics teams.

Key Responsibilities:

Build and maintain robust data pipelines to make enterprise and portfolio data accessible, reliable, and analysis-ready
Own end-to-end ingestion and transformation of internal and external financial datasets
Collaborate closely with quant researchers, PMs, and risk managers to understand how data is consumed and enhance its usability
Ensure data quality, lineage, and availability across the firm's analytical infrastructure
Contribute to broader data modernization efforts across risk and research teams

Ideal Candidate:

3-7 years of experience in a data-driven role supporting front-office or research teams at a hedge fund, asset manager, or proprietary trading firm
Strong programming skills (Python preferred); experience with modern data tooling and pipeline design
Familiarity with financial market data, portfolio data, or risk data
Able to operate with autonomy in a lean, high-performance team
Strategic thinker who enjoys building from the ground up and partnering with stakeholders across quant, tech, and risk

This is a unique opportunity to join a successful and growing team during a pivotal period of transformation, reporting directly into a senior leader overseeing risk and data. You'll play a critical role in how data is structured, accessed, and leveraged across the firm.

World is a network of real humans, built on privacy-preserving proof-of-human technology, and powered by a globally inclusive financial network that enables the free flow of digital assets for all. It is built to connect, empower, and be owned by everyone.

About the team:

The Data Science team is responsible for providing business intelligence services to the whole project and for deriving data-driven insights to support World’s key decisions. Because of our unique growth model of using a global network of Orb Operators to verify individuals’ unique humanness, we require a high-performing Data Science team that is able to manage and analyze large amounts of data generated by our products and operations.

Work in a data-driven and scientific environment where every key decision is supported by thorough data analysis


About You:


Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field like economics, computer science, statistics, or similar
4+ years of hands-on work experience as a data analyst
Extensive experience in Business Intelligence, in particular in data visualization

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

The Sports Data Analyst will play a pivotal role within Disney’s Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Sports Analytics team, supporting the transformation of how we measure, understand, and grow engagement across our sports portfolio. As part of a highly collaborative team that bridges ESPN and Disney Streaming, you'll work on end-to-end analytics workflows: from building foundational datasets and defining KPIs to surfacing insights that drive programming decisions, product optimizations, and marketing strategy.

You’ll partner closely with stakeholders across ESPN Programming, DTC Product, Research, Lifecycle Marketing, and Data Science. Your focus will span from deep-dives into tentpole events and deal performance (e.g., UFC PPVs, NHL games, ESPN+ integrations) to broader ecosystem analyses of fan behavior across streaming, web, and app platforms. Whether you're quantifying the impact of a new feature in the ESPN App or helping define success for a cross-platform sports launch, your work will directly shape the sports streaming experience for millions of fans.

The ideal candidate is equally comfortable exploring raw data and explaining their findings to senior executives, and thrives in an environment that blends sports passion with analytical rigor. This role offers a rare opportunity to sit at the center of one of the most dynamic intersections in media, where real-world sports moments meet digital innovation.

Key Responsibilities



Translate complex subscriber and engagement data into clear, actionable insights to support ESPN content strategy, product development, and marketing effectiveness
Conduct analyses to evaluate the performance of key sports events and programming partnerships (e.g., NHL, College Football, LaLiga), including real-time tentpole monitoring and post-event debriefs
Build and maintain dashboards that visualize trends in cross-platform engagement, fan behavior, and content performance
Develop new metrics and analytical frameworks (e.g., fandom tiering, ecosystem flows) to deepen understanding of how users interact with sports content
Partner with data engineering and product teams to define and improve foundational datasets and engagement pipelines used across the organization
Support product launches and feature rollouts with stakeholder-aligned KPIs, reporting workflows, and performance tracking
Communicate insights through presentations, written briefs, and stakeholder discussions, adapting content for both technical and executive audiences



Basic Qualifications



Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Data Science, Computer Science, Economics, or a related field
3+ years of hands-on experience conducting data analysis in a business or streaming/media context
Fluency in SQL, with the ability to query and transform large-scale behavioral datasets
Proficiency in Python or R for data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and statistical modeling
Experience building dashboards and visualizations in tools like Looker, Tableau, or other tools
Ability to distill complex findings into business-relevant recommendations



Preferred Qualifications



Background in streaming, digital media, or DTC subscription analytics
Experience working with Snowflake or other behavioral data platforms
Knowledge of sports content, fandom patterns, or seasonal audience dynamics
Comfort working across stakeholder groups, including programming, product, data science, and engineering
Exposure to predictive modeling, A/B testing, and experimentation frameworks
Familiarity with subscriber engagement, conversion funnels, or sports content performance metrics



Why Join Us?

Joining the Sports Analytics team means stepping into a uniquely cross-functional role that blends fan passion, business strategy, and technical execution. You'll be part of a high-impact team that:



Acts as the connective tissue between ESPN and Disney Streaming, bringing together behavioral data, strategic priorities, and audience insights to inform the future of sports at Disney
Tackles high-visibility, high-impact questions that influence league partnerships, product launches, subscriber engagement strategies, and cross-platform merchandising
Collaborates with elite analytics partners across Data Science, Product, Engineering, and Research to build models, tools, and measurement frameworks used across the company
Drives innovation through experimentation, data product development, and emerging methodologies, constantly seeking better ways to understand and grow fandom
Celebrates sports and storytelling, applying advanced analytics to bring clarity to the moments, players, and formats that move audiences



You’ll have the chance to work on real-time event reporting during major live sports moments, explore long-term trends in viewer behavior, and help shape how one of the world’s largest media companies delivers sports to fans. This is a team that values curiosity, collaboration, and creativity—and is building the next generation of sports analytics from the ground up.

Ministère de la Justice

Présentiel obligatoire à Paris un jour par semaine (actuellement le mercredi) pour les réunions d’équipe




Tu aimes les données, la Justice et les nouveaux services numériques ? Tu veux mettre ton talent au service de l’intérêt général en aidant les tribunaux à réduire les délais pour les citoyens ?

Rejoins l'équipe A-JUST ! Au sein du Ministère de la Justice, la création de la direction de programme « Outils numériques de pilotage des juridictions » (DiP A-JUST) s’inscrit dans la trajectoire de pérennisation, au sein des services judiciaires, des outils d’aide à la décision et au pilotage des juridictions conçus par la start up d’Etat A-JUST.




Rattachée au directeur des services judiciaires, la direction de programme s’articule autour de 3 domaines d’action stratégique:




PRODUITS: la construction et la gestion en mode produits d’outils numériques dédiés au pilotage des juridictions
DATA: la valorisation des données de pilotage (activité et effectifs) présentes dans ces outils ou dans d’autres applicatifs, dans une logique de mutualisation opérationnelle
ACCOMPAGNEMENT: la formation et l’accompagnement à la transformation des pratiques de pilotage des équipes de direction par l’usage de ces produits numériques ainsi mis en cohérence.




La DiP A-JUST fonctionne selon la méthodologie des start up d’Etat:




équipe intégrant l’ensemble des compétences nécessaires à la construction, la gestion, le déploiement et la valorisation d’outils numériques, alliant compétences métier (fonctionnement des juridictions), techniques et d’accompagnement au changement.
application des principes généraux du « mode produit »: les utilisateurs et la résolution de leurs problèmes sont au centre de toute décision, les évolutions fonctionnent par boucles d'itérations rapides avec un droit à l'erreur, l'équipe est autonome dans les choix qui impactent le produit et pour interagir avec les utilisateurs (notamment, pas de séparation MOE/MOA, c’est-à-dire entre conception et réalisation) : elle est à ce titre redevable de son action auprès d’une gouvernance impliquant les utilisateurs.
respect de la finalité des produits en adéquation avec les enjeux de la politique prioritaire de réduction des délais de justice, pilotage par l’impact.

From the house of dream to the house of talents

« Quoi que vous fassiez - pour le travail ou le plaisir - faites-le avec passion ! Vivez avec passion... »* Christian Dior

Christian Dior fut le couturier du rêve. Dès la fondation de sa Maison en 1947, marquée par la révolution du New Look, il métamorphose ses songes en de merveilleuses créations. Son esprit visionnaire n’a eu de cesse de magnifier les femmes du monde entier, inspirant aujourd’hui et plus que jamais ses successeurs. « Le tissu est le seul véhicule de nos rêves (…). La mode, en somme, est issue d’un rêve, et le rêve, c’est une évasion », écrivait-il dans son ouvrage Je suis couturier. Au fil de ses collections, Monsieur Dior est devenu le démiurge du bonheur de ses muses.

Aujourd’hui, riche de cet héritage d’exception et d’une communauté de plus de 7 500 talents, notre Maison incarne plus que jamais la Maison des Talents pensé par Christian Dior. Dans plus de 40 pays, nous faisons rayonner notre savoir-faire, notre audace et notre excellence à travers la passion et la créativité de nos collaborateurs. Rejoignez-nous et créez votre avenir dans notre univers généreux, disruptif et ambitieux où nous grandissons dans l’excellence, le courage et l’optimisme.

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have a true love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem and living inside a spreadsheet or data set to find the answer to any question.
You have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization tools, and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis.
Experience with Marketing APIs, BigQuery or other cloud data warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks), ETL tools (such as Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics), and/or Python is a plus.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and at least 1 year of experience working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.

What You’ll Do:




Reporting:

Maintain customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence.
Use Advanced Excel, SQL, and Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools to generate pivot tables and other visualizations summarizing thousands of lines of data.
Translate performance media metrics into clear, digestible reports for client advertising campaigns.
Communicate insights effectively through Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.




Strategy:

Learn our clients’ businesses and align media strategy with their business goals.
Analyze advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to guide media buying strategy.
Apply your background in paid media and/or digital advertising, including understanding concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue.
Engage in discussions with clients to build trust and gain stakeholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.




Gupta Media is an office-first organization.
