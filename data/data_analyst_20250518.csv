About Us

Baobab's mission is to protect SMEs against cyber attacks better.

We rethink Cyber protection for SMEs by integrating Cyber Insurance with preventive cyber security services.

Like the Baobab tree, Baobab stands for security and support in all circumstances. We help our partners, as well as customers, to better understand cyber (risks). We not only focus on remediation after an incident but also reduce the likelihood of such an event.

We are supported by renowned investors such as Project A, and La Famiglia. In Zurich Insurance, we also have a solid partner with whom we have made a dynamic start as a risk carrier in the market.

Why is cyber insurance important for SMEs? Regardless of size, every business has vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit. Just because a company is small doesn't mean it can't be a target of a cyber-attack. The cyber sector is so fast-moving that there is always a residual risk here, which should then be insured.

We believe that diversity in the team makes the company stronger. We do not discriminate on the basis of religion, skin color, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, or disability and welcome applications from all backgrounds. Apply now to become part of our team!

About Us

Baobab's mission is to protect SMEs against cyber attacks better.

We rethink Cyber protection for SMEs by integrating Cyber Insurance with preventive cyber security services.

Like the Baobab tree, Baobab stands for security and support in all circumstances. We help our partners, as well as customers, to better understand cyber (risks). We not only focus on remediation after an incident but also reduce the likelihood of such an event.

We are supported by renowned investors such as Project A, and La Famiglia. In Zurich Insurance, we also have a solid partner with whom we have made a dynamic start as a risk carrier in the market.

Why is cyber insurance important for SMEs? Regardless of size, every business has vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit. Just because a company is small doesn't mean it can't be a target of a cyber-attack. The cyber sector is so fast-moving that there is always a residual risk here, which should then be insured.

We believe that diversity in the team makes the company stronger. We do not discriminate on the basis of religion, skin color, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, or disability and welcome applications from all backgrounds. Apply now to become part of our team!

About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of more than 240 employees from over 40 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

Your Mission

We are seeking a technically-skilled Marketing Data Analyst who will turn our performance marketing data into actionable insights. This role bridges marketing and data — from implementing tracking setups and managing attribution logic to building dashboards and spotting trends across Meta, Google, and TikTok.

Your Responsibilities


Handling data transparency from campaign to ad level (including sign-up and post-trial behavior tracking leading to ROAS)
Optimizing the tech and data set-up across ad tools, particularly Meta
Providing insights into areas of growth and opportunity
Building out reporting frameworks to help us make better data-driven decisions across all channels (Meta, Google, TikTok, YouTube)
Potentially assisting in the analysis for native app communication once that project is underway in the next 6-12 months.
Own and optimize our tracking setup (incl. GA4, Meta CAPI, GTM, server-side tracking).
Write SQL queries to analyze campaign performance and build self-serve dashboards.
Collaborate with Tech and BI teams to ensure clean and reliable marketing data infrastructure.
Use tools like Looker, BigQuery, or similar to generate insights and reports.


Role Specific Requirements

We’re looking for someone who:


3+ years of experience in a marketing-focused data analytics role, ideally in an eCommerce or subscription-based B2C environment
Open to: less years of analyst experience but prior experience working as a performance marketing manager and then turned into an analyst
Hands-on experience with Meta Ads Manager and other key platforms like Google, TikTok, and YouTube
Experience in bridging the gap between marketing and tech, particularly someone who’s been a performance marketer before transitioning into an analyst role, or someone with experience in a data team (e.g., Meta).
Strong passion for both marketing and analytics, with a problem-solving mindset and an eye for identifying growth opportunities.


Why Join Us?


Grow your marketing analytics skills while contributing to real-world business projects.
Work with data to help the business better understand and serve its customers.
Collaborate with a supportive team of cross-functional stakeholders.
Gain exposure to industry-standard tools and best practices in data analysis and marketing.
Be part of a company that values curiosity, learning, and continuous improvement.

Als Analyst für Healthcare Analytics bist du Teil von Beratungsteams bei Klienten sowie von internen Projekten, Recherchen und Analysen zu Unternehmen und Trends in den europäischen Gesundheitssystemen. Wir sind Teil von McKinseys globalem Client Capability Network (CCN) mit mehr als 7.000 Kolleginnen und Kollegen, die unsere Klienten und Beratungsteams mit Expertise und Branchenanalysen unterstützen. Zur Verstärkung unseres Teams in Deutschland suchen wir dich zum nächstmöglichen Zeitpunkt als Analyst für Healthcare Analytics.

Das Healthcare Analytics Team nutzt Analysen und Daten aus dem Gesundheitswesen (z.B. Krankenversicherungen oder Gesundheitseinrichtungen), um einige der dringendsten Fragen unserer Klienten zu beantworten, wie zum Beispiel „Wie können wir die Kosten der Gesundheitsversorgung optimieren und gleichzeitig die Qualität verbessern?“, „Wie bleiben wir wettbewerbsfähig in der sich wandelnden Gesundheitslandschaft?“, „Wer sind die sensibelsten Patientengruppen und mit welchen Behandlungspfaden können wir ihre Versorgung verbessern?

Healthcare Analytics ist ein Team innerhalb der SHaPE-Practice (Social, Healthcare and Public Entities) mit Fokus auf die spezialisierte Beratung von Einrichtungen des Gesundheitswesens, insbesondere Kostenträger. Unser Ziel ist es mit der Unterstützung von Advanced Analytics und unseren standardisierten Methoden für Diagnostik, Optimierung und Implementierung für unsere Klienten positive und nachhaltige Veränderung zu erzielen.

Your Impact

In der Rolle als Analyst in Healthcare Analytics unterstützt du zum einen unsere Beratungsteams mit quantitativen und qualitativen Analysen und entwickelst unser Portfolio an analytischen Lösungen und innovativen Lösungsansätzen kontinuierlich weiter.

Zum anderen bist du ein fester Bestandteil der Beratungsteams beim Klienten vor Ort und bist somit direkt an der Erstellung von nachhaltigen Lösungen für unsere Klienten im Gesundheitssektor beteiligt. Letzteres erfordert Fähigkeiten im Projektmanagement und in der Kommunikation mit diversen Stakeholdern. Du wirst die Gelegenheit haben, aktiv mit Klienten aus verschiedenen Bereichen wie Krankenversicherungen, Leistungserbringern oder Private Equity zusammenzuarbeiten.

Im Healthcare Analytics Team handeln wir unternehmerisch. Daher suchen wir jemanden mit Motivation, kontinuierlich den Status Quo zu verbessern und dies auch eigenständig voranzutreiben.

Als Analyst wird erwartet, dass du Expertise in mindestens einem Segment des deutschen Gesundeitswesens (z.B. Krankenversicherungen oder Leistunserbringer) besitzt erste Erfahrungen bzw. eine Begeisterung für quantitative Analysen mitbringst. Darüber hinaus, hast du das Interesse dich in beiden Bereichen umfangreich fortzubilden und weiteres Wissen und Fähigkeiten zu erlangen.

Bei entsprechender Qualificiation ist eine Anstellung als Specialist möglich.

Your Qualifications and Skills


Mit sehr gutem Erfolg abgeschlossenes Master- oder Promotionsstudium im wirtschafts-, sozialwirtschafts- oder naturwissenschaftlichen Bereich mit optionalem Bezug zum Gesundheitswesen (u.a. Gesundheitsökonomie oder Healthcare Management)
2+ Jahre Berufserfahrung in einem relevanten Bereich (z.B. Krankenversicherung, Leistungserbringer, Beratung)
Leidenschaft für gesundheitsbezogene Themen (in Form von guten Kenntnissen der deutschen oder europäischen Gesundheitsbranche und dem Interesse sich in diesem Bereich weiterzubilden und zu spezialisieren)
Affinität für Daten und Analysen, sowie idealerweise Erfahrung in der Qualitätssicherung und Strukturierung von Daten
Ausgezeichnete Problemlösungsfähigkeiten, insbesondere im analytischen und quantitativen Bereich
Ausgeprägtes unternehmerisches Handeln mit der Motivation, kontinuierlich den Status Quo zu verbessern und dies auch eigenständig voranzutreiben

Your Mission

We are seeking a technically-skilled Marketing Data Analyst who will turn our performance marketing data into actionable insights. This role bridges marketing and data — from implementing tracking setups and managing attribution logic to building dashboards and spotting trends across Meta, Google, and TikTok.

Your Responsibilities


Handling data transparency from campaign to ad level (including sign-up and post-trial behavior tracking leading to ROAS)
Optimizing the tech and data set-up across ad tools, particularly Meta
Providing insights into areas of growth and opportunity
Building out reporting frameworks to help us make better data-driven decisions across all channels (Meta, Google, TikTok, YouTube)
Potentially assisting in the analysis for native app communication once that project is underway in the next 6-12 months.
Own and optimize our tracking setup (incl. GA4, Meta CAPI, GTM, server-side tracking).
Write SQL queries to analyze campaign performance and build self-serve dashboards.
Collaborate with Tech and BI teams to ensure clean and reliable marketing data infrastructure.
Use tools like Looker, BigQuery, or similar to generate insights and reports.


Role Specific Requirements

We’re looking for someone who:


3+ years of experience in a marketing-focused data analytics role, ideally in an eCommerce or subscription-based B2C environment
Open to: less years of analyst experience but prior experience working as a performance marketing manager and then turned into an analyst
Hands-on experience with Meta Ads Manager and other key platforms like Google, TikTok, and YouTube
Experience in bridging the gap between marketing and tech, particularly someone who’s been a performance marketer before transitioning into an analyst role, or someone with experience in a data team (e.g., Meta).
Strong passion for both marketing and analytics, with a problem-solving mindset and an eye for identifying growth opportunities.


Why Join Us?


Grow your marketing analytics skills while contributing to real-world business projects.
Work with data to help the business better understand and serve its customers.
Collaborate with a supportive team of cross-functional stakeholders.
Gain exposure to industry-standard tools and best practices in data analysis and marketing.
Be part of a company that values curiosity, learning, and continuous improvement.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

We are looking for a Data Analyst that is passionate about metrics and telling the stories behind the data. We have several roles open across different teams (grocery, loyalty, restaurants). Data Analysts at Deliveroo report into our data science management team.

You will be a professional in insights storytelling, communication and visualisation and know how to create action from metrics. Crafting effective intelligent benchmarks, understanding performance, caring about data quality, enabling automation and creating phenomenal visualisations and stories are things that drive you.

What You'll Be Doing


Work closely with commercial stakeholders to create value and business impact through better data availability, visualisation and analysis
Discover, analyse, and interpret trends or patterns in complex datasets to perform ad-hoc analyses and deliver insights to the executive team and senior management
Understand key drivers of the business and provide data driven guidance on key levers
Identify and specify data needs and quality requirements and work closely with Analytics Engineers to ensure data is available, accurate and corresponds to the business needs
Consolidate and distribute best analytical practices from different teams and countries


Requirements


Experience identifying the root cause of problems, assessing risks/impacts and determining and implementing effective solutions.
A good understanding of querying in SQL and understanding of database structure - you'll be expected to be able to extract the data you need for your analysis.
Compelling story-telling skills, and an eye for powerful visualisations - you'll need to translate your findings for all levels of stakeholder (business and technical)
Good knowledge of Excel/GSheets - depending on the task, there is a good chance that this is where some of your exploratory analysis will take place. Being comfortable with pivot tables and functions will be essential.
Developer experience with a data visualisation tool (Looker, Tableau, Periscope)

About the role

The Data Analyst works within the Data Team, using and transforming data from multiple sources to produce high quality, digestible reports, dashboards, and bespoke pieces of analysis for our fundraising and alumni colleagues. You will also lead on any benchmarking projects, both the submission of data and the interpretation and presentation of their findings. Being a clear communicator of often complex information, you will deliver insight into the performance of our various fundraising and engagement programmes, giving colleagues the information they need to continually innovate and improve.

In addition, you will have a raft of technical skills and approaches that will enable you to efficiently transform source data from multiple data sources ready for import into our Dynamics CRM system.

You will be required to liaise and work collaboratively with other teams on new fundraising projects and initiatives, thereby ensuring a joined-up approach, that future reporting requirements can be met, with learning shared and insight retained. You will often need to manage multiple requests and prioritise your workload, albeit we have adopted an Agile approach to development.

This is a full time post (35 hours per week), and you will be offered an indefinite contract. P&A has a hybrid working approach, with a minimum of 40% of time in the office. Typically, this equates to two days per week, but we’re very happy for colleagues to be in more frequently if they so wish.

Hi, we’re MoonPay. We’re here to onboard the world to Web3.

Why? Because we think Web3 is a unique and democratising technology. It gives people back control of their money, digital identity, data, and property like nothing else before it.

What We Do
We’re the leading infrastructure company in Web3. This means we offer our partners everything from payment solutions (we call them 'Ramps') to minting software for digital collectibles, like NFTs. And over 30 million people around the world now trust our products — just take a look on Trustpilot.

We’re also big on collaborations. And we've worked on stunts, drops, and partnerships with some of the world's most prestigious and forward-thinking brands.

But that’s not all. We have also built our own consumer app because we wanted to see if we could build a better Web3 account. It’s taken off in a big way, and we're working hard to continually improve it and to strive for perfection.

So whatever your background, we’re sure there’s something for you here. Come help us build the future of Web3 and digital ownership.

Salary: Up to £50,000 plus generous package




Location: London, Hybrid (3 days per week onsite)




Position: Permanent







I'm partnered with an ambitious and fast-growing wealth management group, backed by private equity and actively expanding through strategic acquisitions. This is a business that combines the agility of a scale-up with the backing and stability of a well-capitalised, established firm. Their modular approach to wealth services has positioned them as a major disruptor in the UK financial services space.




As part of this transformation journey, they are looking to bring on a Data Analyst - a key strategic and operational role reporting into the CTO. This role sits at the heart of technology operations and is instrumental in shaping how data is used to drive decisions, monitor performance, and deliver operational excellence across the technology function.




This isn’t a traditional back-office data role. You’ll act as the connective tissue between the CTO, Finance, Delivery, and other leadership teams, helping to ensure that data is consistently driving smarter decisions and strategic alignment.




What You’ll Be Doing:

Designing and maintaining executive dashboards that provide visibility into financials, supplier performance, risk, delivery metrics, and workforce analytics
Leading budget tracking, cost control, and forecasting within the technology function
Managing vendor data, including contract renewals, reviews, and supplier KPIs
Monitoring and reporting on operational and technology risks, security vulnerabilities, and audit items
Aggregating Agile delivery metrics and reporting progress against forecasted business benefits
Supporting governance and prioritisation processes with high-quality data and analysis
Acting as a liaison across key stakeholders, ensuring alignment and structured decision-making
Identifying and driving improvements across operational workflows




Skills and Qualifications:

Experience in a technology operations, business management, or data-driven strategy role
Financial experience across budgeting, variance analysis, and cost tracking; ideally with an accounting qualification (CIMA, ACCA, ACA) or equivalent experience
Excellent proficiency with data analytics tools - particularly Power BI and Excel
Deep understanding of IT operations, supplier management, and risk frameworks
Familiarity with Agile delivery principles and project performance tracking
Confident communicator, comfortable working with senior stakeholders and across departments
Ability to turn complex data into clear, actionable insight




Perks (to name a few):

Attractive employee pension scheme
25 days annual leave + public holidays + office Christmas close (3 days)
Buy and sell holidays up to 5 days
Private medical insurance, group life insurance, and income protection insurance
Discretionary performance-related bonus




This is a rare opportunity to join a business in high-growth mode, where you’ll be empowered to shape how data drives performance and technology strategy from the inside out. If this sounds like your kind of challenge, don't hesitate to apply!

📍West London (3 days a week on-site)

💸£55,000 – £60,000




About the Company

A leading name in the UK property sector is on the hunt for a mid-level Data Analyst to join their growing data team. With a strong foundation in Business Intelligence and a forward-thinking approach to tech, this company has spent the last five years investing heavily in their data infrastructure and are now gearing up to take things even further — including AI implementation over the next 6–12 months. 🚀




They're working on internal data projects with real commercial impact and are looking for someone who can not only crunch the numbers, but also tell the story behind them.




The Role

You’ll take the lead on key analytics initiatives, working end-to-end across data pipelines, visualisation, and stakeholder communication. It’s a hands-on role with plenty of variety — perfect for someone who enjoys making sense of messy data and translating that into insight that drives decisions.




You'll also play a key part in their early AI-driven projects, focused on improving sales processes and customer interactions through transcript analysis and intelligent feedback tools.




What You’ll Be Doing

📈 Lead dashboard development using Power BI, delivering enterprise-grade reports that drive business insight
🔍 End-to-end data analysis, from extraction and transformation to insight using SQL and Python
🗣️ Present findings to stakeholders across all levels, breaking down complex analysis into clear, commercial terms
👥 Run workshops/training to help non-technical users engage with dashboards and tools
🤖 Contribute to AI initiative, including mining sales call data, building feedback prompts, and extracting insights from customer conversations




The Ideal Candidate

Has spent a few years working in data-focused roles, with solid hands-on experience in real-world commercial environments.
Brings a strong academic foundation, ideally in a technical or numerical subject such as Maths, Physics, Engineering, or Computer Science.
Comfortable owning projects end-to-end, from working with raw data to presenting insights that drive business decisions.
A confident communicator who can explain complex analysis in a simple, engaging way.
Technically fluent with Power BI, SQL, and Python, and eager to work with modern tools like Fabric and Copilot.
Curious, analytical, and thrives in a fast-paced, collaborative setting.




💡 This role is ideal for someone looking to step into a more visible, hands-on position where they can shape how data is used across a business — and get early exposure to AI innovation in a real-world commercial setting.

Salary: £37,007 - £38,821 (inclusive of London Weighting)

Benefits: 28 days holiday plus public holidays, Local Government Pension Scheme, Cycle to Work scheme, Employee Assistance Programme

About Us – West London Waste Authority (WLWA)

WLWA is a statutory public body responsible for managing waste disposal for six London boroughs: Brent, Ealing, Harrow, Hillingdon, Hounslow and Richmond upon Thames. Working on behalf of over 1.7 million residents, we manage the treatment, transfer and disposal of waste and recycling that local councils collect.

We coordinate complex waste operations, liaise with multiple contractors and public sector partners, and deliver environmental services with a focus on efficiency and sustainability. As the sector becomes more data-driven, we are investing in the way we collect, manage and use information across borough boundaries.

Make Public Sector Data Work Better Across Borough Boundaries

To support this transformation, we’re looking for a Data & Business Intelligence Analyst (internally known as “MI Analyst”) who can work confidently at the intersection of data, systems and people.

This role is for someone who can build robust, insightful reports — while also working collaboratively across boroughs, finance teams and contractors to align data capture and reporting.

This is a delivery-focused position with the opportunity to shape how information flows between organisations and influences operational, financial and environmental decision-making.

What You'll Do


Design, build and maintain automated dashboards and reporting tools using Power BI, DAX, Power Query, and SQL
Gather, validate and integrate data from boroughs and contractors, ensuring consistency and quality
Support statutory data returns (e.g. Waste Data Flow) and produce management and financial reports
Investigate discrepancies, spot data issues early, and engage constructively with partners to resolve them
Collaborate closely with internal colleagues and external stakeholders to deliver improvements in reporting accuracy, usability and efficiency

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Provide regular insights and recommendations to the leadership team.


What We Are Looking For


Experience at a high growth B2B SaaS company.
Strong understanding of go to market motions, sales metrics, and marketing metrics.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources
Define and monitor key economic impact metrics
Go deep on understanding business drivers, user segments, cohorts and macroeconomic trends
Prepare presentations, analyses and visualizations for internal and external executive audiences
Partner closely with Communications, Policy, Marketing and Product teams to identify and analyze key trends and produce thought leadership pieces and campaign content leveraging Stripe data
Collaborate with external vendors, academics, and think tanks to advance Stripe’s research agenda and advocacy positions



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources
Define and monitor key economic impact metrics
Go deep on understanding business drivers, user segments, cohorts and macroeconomic trends
Prepare presentations, analyses and visualizations for internal and external executive audiences
Partner closely with Communications, Policy, Marketing and Product teams to identify and analyze key trends and produce thought leadership pieces and campaign content leveraging Stripe data
Collaborate with external vendors, academics, and think tanks to advance Stripe’s research agenda and advocacy positions



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.
