Recidiviz is thrilled to be hiring a Policy Data Analyst to join our team! We're a small, fast-moving group that works with complex criminal justice data from our state partners and develops analyses and tools that target the drivers of incarceration. That's where you come in. We're looking for someone who has attention to detail to improve our analysis, creativity and inquisitiveness to identify and solve open-ended problems, clarity to think through complex and variable data, flexibility to adjust in a rapidly evolving environment, and above all else, a collaborative, kind nature to add to our culture.

About Us

Recidiviz is creating safer, healthier communities by improving outcomes for people in the criminal justice system. We build technology to reduce the number of people in prison and to help criminal justice leaders embrace data-driven decision-making.

Using software tools and thoughtful product design, we've been able to safely and permanently reduce incarceration and improve outcomes. We work side-by-side with leaders of the criminal justice system, people in prison and on supervision, and ecosystem partners to build a better path forward. In addition to the revenue we earn from state partners, some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations support our work.

People who succeed at Recidiviz lead with kindness and humility, assume good intent, learn from failure, and fix problems when they see them. They are excited to work arm in arm with government leadership and staff to improve outcomes. They are great listeners. They build deep relationships with and empathy for the people we work with and the people who our mission serves, even when those two groups feel at odds.

About The Role

Recidiviz's policy team supports state Department of Corrections (DOC) leaders that want to rewrite old policies or implement new ones, rooted in evidence and analytics, to improve outcomes, increase public safety and community health, and drive meaningful changes. We tailor data analysis, built on detailed DOC data, to answer questions like: What combination of criteria best select for probation clients who are safe to discharge? What static factors influence parole decisions today and how would that change if new, dynamic factors were added? How many people would X, Y, or Z adjustment to a policy affect and what can we say about the affected group? By translating concepts into concrete modeling, we help drive smarter and more ambitious change.

This role collaborates across several teams to guide work that targets the drivers of incarceration. Our Policy Data Analysts work with diverse data – criminal justice data both raw and processed from across the country, reports and policy documents from government agencies, and much more – to develop the policy analyses that deepen our understanding of the criminal justice system and motivate policy change. Our Policy Data Analysts translate policy concepts into quantitative metrics, perform analyses, and play a key role in contextualizing and presenting their analyses to stakeholders, both internal and external.

Travel of approximately one week per quarter may be required.

Core responsibilities

Minimum Qualifications


Strong communication and collaboration skills, to help nurture a knowledgeable, data-oriented culture

Sufficient math or statistical background to reason about analysis design, examine results closely, and prepare data and analyses that are usable for various applications
2 or more years of practical experience exploring, analyzing, and processing complex datasets
Professional work experience using SQL to work with large datasets, including high proficiency writing efficient queries for more complex data extraction and transformation tasks
High familiarity with Python, specifically Pandas package, for tasks such as statistical analysis and data visualization


Preferred Qualifications


Experience adapting customized quantitative methods that introduce intuitively meaningful metrics in ambiguous, unconstrained contexts
Experience working in a cross-functional organization that designs, builds, and launches products for users
Experience working with large datasets from the public sector, especially related to criminal justice
Familiarity with our data stack, which includes Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery, Looker, Jupyter notebooks, and Python/Pandas


Compensation

More about Recidiviz

Recidiviz was an all-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we've built an A-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator's 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.

Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) over 18 state partners – big and small, red and blue – and covers more than 40% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners – from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.

To learn more about how we do what we do, check out our 2024 Year in Review, read some press coverage, or watch our TED Talk. And if you're really keen to see our work, you can dive into our Github :).

An important note

Lasting change is always built on diversity. Recidiviz recruits, employs, trains, compensates and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, veteran status, ancestry, citizenship, marital status, gender identity and all protected status as required by applicable law. We consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you have a special need that requires accommodation, please let us know in your application. Even if you don't think you meet all the criteria above, drop your resume, and we'll take a look – you might be great for another role or another time!

Strong programming skills (Python preferred); experience with modern data tooling and pipeline design
Familiarity with financial market data, portfolio data, or risk data

This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

The Sports Data Analyst will play a pivotal role within Disney’s Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Sports Analytics team, supporting the transformation of how we measure, understand, and grow engagement across our sports portfolio.

You’ll partner closely with stakeholders across ESPN Programming, DTC Product, Research, Lifecycle Marketing, and Data Science. Your focus will span from deep-dives into tentpole events and deal performance (e.g., UFC PPVs, NHL games, ESPN+ integrations) to broader ecosystem analyses of fan behavior across streaming, web, and app platforms. Whether you're quantifying the impact of a new feature in the ESPN App or helping define success for a cross-platform sports launch, your work will directly shape the sports streaming experience for millions of fans.

The ideal candidate is equally comfortable exploring raw data and explaining their findings to senior executives, and thrives in an environment that blends sports passion with analytical rigor. This role offers a rare opportunity to sit at the center of one of the most dynamic intersections in media, where real-world sports moments meet digital innovation.

Key Responsibilities



Translate complex subscriber and engagement data into clear, actionable insights to support ESPN content strategy, product development, and marketing effectiveness
Conduct analyses to evaluate the performance of key sports events and programming partnerships (e.g., NHL, College Football, LaLiga), including real-time tentpole monitoring and post-event debriefs
Build and maintain dashboards that visualize trends in cross-platform engagement, fan behavior, and content performance
Develop new metrics and analytical frameworks (e.g., fandom tiering, ecosystem flows) to deepen understanding of how users interact with sports content
Partner with data engineering and product teams to define and improve foundational datasets and engagement pipelines used across the organization
Support product launches and feature rollouts with stakeholder-aligned KPIs, reporting workflows, and performance tracking
Communicate insights through presentations, written briefs, and stakeholder discussions, adapting content for both technical and executive audiences



Basic Qualifications



Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Data Science, Computer Science, Economics, or a related field
3+ years of hands-on experience conducting data analysis in a business or streaming/media context
Fluency in SQL, with the ability to query and transform large-scale behavioral datasets
Proficiency in Python or R for data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and statistical modeling
Experience building dashboards and visualizations in tools like Looker, Tableau, or other tools
Ability to distill complex findings into business-relevant recommendations



Preferred Qualifications



Background in streaming, digital media, or DTC subscription analytics
Experience working with Snowflake or other behavioral data platforms
Knowledge of sports content, fandom patterns, or seasonal audience dynamics
Comfort working across stakeholder groups, including programming, product, data science, and engineering
Exposure to predictive modeling, A/B testing, and experimentation frameworks
Familiarity with subscriber engagement, conversion funnels, or sports content performance metrics



Why Join Us?

Joining the Sports Analytics team means stepping into a uniquely cross-functional role that blends fan passion, business strategy, and technical execution. You'll be part of a high-impact team that:



Acts as the connective tissue between ESPN and Disney Streaming, bringing together behavioral data, strategic priorities, and audience insights to inform the future of sports at Disney
Tackles high-visibility, high-impact questions that influence league partnerships, product launches, subscriber engagement strategies, and cross-platform merchandising
Collaborates with elite analytics partners across Data Science, Product, Engineering, and Research to build models, tools, and measurement frameworks used across the company
Drives innovation through experimentation, data product development, and emerging methodologies, constantly seeking better ways to understand and grow fandom
Celebrates sports and storytelling, applying advanced analytics to bring clarity to the moments, players, and formats that move audiences



You’ll have the chance to work on real-time event reporting during major live sports moments, explore long-term trends in viewer behavior, and help shape how one of the world’s largest media companies delivers sports to fans. This is a team that values curiosity, collaboration, and creativity—and is building the next generation of sports analytics from the ground up.

At IKEA, we do things a little differently. We think differently, act differently, and work differently as well. We like to break things—like rules—and then make things, like music-playing lamps and beds disguised as sofas. It’s all part of our vision: to create a better everyday life for the many people. By 2030, we hope to help millions more look forward to going home. Maybe you can help us? 

About The Area 

Core Business Retail Concept is dedicated to protecting, expanding, and developing the IKEA Concept and the IKEA Brand in both existing and new markets. This includes sharing IKEA knowledge and learning across the franchise system.  Retail Concept consists of the following areas: Brand & Marketing, Expansion, Learning, Retail Experience and Retail Concept Operations.  

About The Assignment 

We offer unique IKEA specialist competence in developing, improving, designing, establishing, and operating IKEA Customer Meeting Points based on a market approach across all IKEA markets. Customer Meeting Points include IKEA Stores, Small Stores, Pick-up & Points, Plan Shops, and Plan & Order Points. We coach, mentor, support, and challenge IKEA retailers in their expansion plans and collaborate with our IKEA franchisees in over 50 countries worldwide. We thrive in a multicultural environment where we comfortably use English (spoken and written) to communicate. We co-create and innovate IKEA retail architecture, transforming market and business needs into outstanding customer experiences. 

Do you want to take part in supporting the designing of IKEA customer meeting places worldwide through the analysis, presentation and clear sharing of data and information? Would you like to work in an open-minded and international environment? Then we are looking for you! 

About The Role 

We are looking for a data analyst intern for a 12-month period at our office in Malmö, starting September 2025. During your internship, you will be a member of our Process, Service and Tools team.

Ministère de la Justice

35 rue de la Gare, 75019 Paris. Télétravail possible.

Présentiel obligatoire à Paris un jour par semaine (actuellement le mercredi) pour les réunions d’équipe




Tu aimes les données, la Justice et les nouveaux services numériques ? Tu veux mettre ton talent au service de l’intérêt général en aidant les tribunaux à réduire les délais pour les citoyens ?

Rejoins l'équipe A-JUST ! Au sein du Ministère de la Justice, la création de la direction de programme « Outils numériques de pilotage des juridictions » (DiP A-JUST) s’inscrit dans la trajectoire de pérennisation, au sein des services judiciaires, des outils d’aide à la décision et au pilotage des juridictions conçus par la start up d’Etat A-JUST.




Rattachée au directeur des services judiciaires, la direction de programme s’articule autour de 3 domaines d’action stratégique:




PRODUITS: la construction et la gestion en mode produits d’outils numériques dédiés au pilotage des juridictions
DATA: la valorisation des données de pilotage (activité et effectifs) présentes dans ces outils ou dans d’autres applicatifs, dans une logique de mutualisation opérationnelle
ACCOMPAGNEMENT: la formation et l’accompagnement à la transformation des pratiques de pilotage des équipes de direction par l’usage de ces produits numériques ainsi mis en cohérence.




La DiP A-JUST fonctionne selon la méthodologie des start up d’Etat:




équipe intégrant l’ensemble des compétences nécessaires à la construction, la gestion, le déploiement et la valorisation d’outils numériques, alliant compétences métier (fonctionnement des juridictions), techniques et d’accompagnement au changement.
application des principes généraux du « mode produit »: les utilisateurs et la résolution de leurs problèmes sont au centre de toute décision, les évolutions fonctionnent par boucles d'itérations rapides avec un droit à l'erreur, l'équipe est autonome dans les choix qui impactent le produit et pour interagir avec les utilisateurs (notamment, pas de séparation MOE/MOA, c’est-à-dire entre conception et réalisation) : elle est à ce titre redevable de son action auprès d’une gouvernance impliquant les utilisateurs.
respect de la finalité des produits en adéquation avec les enjeux de la politique prioritaire de réduction des délais de justice, pilotage par l’impact.




Composition de l'équipe




1 directeur de projet magistrat
1 coach/PO, responsable data
1 expert métier et outils (recrutement en cours)
1 directeur technique (recrutement en cours)
3 développeurs informatiques

Le contrat : Emploi accessible aux personnes en situation de handicap. Rémunération envisagée entre 16 250 et 22 500€ bruts annuels pour un temps partiel, en fonction de l'expérience.




Ta mission : Tu contribueras au processus d’amélioration continue de la donnée opérationnelle de pilotage afin de permettre aux juridictions de disposer d’une vision la plus précise, récente et exploitable possible de leur activité. Tu travailleras à diversifier et fiabiliser les sources de données, en automatiser la collecte et accompagner les acteurs de terrain dans la compréhension, l’analyse et l’utilisation des données mises à leur disposition dans les outils de la DiP A-JUST afin de faciliter leurs prises de décisions, ainsi éclairées par l’impact.




Au quotidien, en lien avec le responsable data, la mission consiste à :

améliorer les algorithmes de pré-alimentation des outils du programme en données d’activité des juridictions
analyser les bases statistiques disponibles pour créer des requêtes permettant de collecter les données manquantes

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have a true love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem and living inside a spreadsheet or data set to find the answer to any question.
You have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization tools, and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis.
Experience with Marketing APIs, BigQuery or other cloud data warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks), ETL tools (such as Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics), and/or Python is a plus.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and at least 1 year of experience working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.

What You’ll Do:




Reporting:

Maintain customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence.
Use Advanced Excel, SQL, and Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools to generate pivot tables and other visualizations summarizing thousands of lines of data.
Translate performance media metrics into clear, digestible reports for client advertising campaigns.
Communicate insights effectively through Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.




Strategy:

Learn our clients’ businesses and align media strategy with their business goals.
Analyze advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to guide media buying strategy.
Apply your background in paid media and/or digital advertising, including understanding concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue.
Engage in discussions with clients to build trust and gain stakeholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.

Pearl Health is powering the future of healthcare. We help primary care providers and organizations to deliver quality healthcare to the patients who need it most, when they need it most — and get rewarded for keeping patients healthy.

Our technology, services, and financial tools enable better, more proactive care, decrease total cost of care across patient panels, and optimize performance in value-based care models for Traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage.

We are a team of physicians and public health experts (Stanford, Harvard, Mount Sinai), technologists (athenahealth, Amazon, Meta, Flatiron), healthcare innovators (Centivo, Aledade, Stellar, Arcadia), and experienced risk management professionals (CVS/Aetna, Humana, Oscar) who believe that primary care providers are the key to addressing our healthcare system’s biggest challenges.

Since its founding in 2020, Pearl has expanded to partner with thousands of primary care providers in practices and organizations across 44 states. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Viking Global Investors, AlleyCorp, and SV Angel.

What We Hope You Can Do...

As a Staff Data Analyst at Pearl, you'll be instrumental in building robust data analytics infrastructure and driving data-informed decisions that impact our clinical outcomes and P&L. You will tackle challenging problems related to practice engagement, patient spend insights, network analytics, collaborating with Data Science, Product, Engineering, and Customer Success teams to identify opportunities, build robust analytical solutions, and develop and maintain KPIs that offer actionable insights to the organization. This role provides an opportunity to leverage your analytical and architectural expertise to make a tangible impact on healthcare. You'll have the opportunity to mentor other data analysts as well as have a leadership role on key projects.

What Staff Data Analyst means to us...

Establish and champion best-in-class data architectures, encompassing schema design, data ontologies, governance processes, and optimization strategies (query and computer fine tuning) to ensure scalable, reliable, and well-governed data assets.
Manage ambiguity while working with cross-functional teams on complex projects, with a focus on defining data requirements, developing analytical models, and interpreting results.
Partner with Data Engineering and Product to create end-to-end data pipelines that turn raw data into actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.
Contribute to the development of the data analytics roadmap and strategy by collaborating with leadership in the Data Science and Analytics organization to identify opportunities and propose technical and business-level solutions with a medium-term (1-2 year) time horizon.
Evaluate new data technologies and tools (including data warehouses, orchestration systems, and BI tools) to enhance the team's capabilities.
Mentor other data analysts, providing guidance on analytical techniques and best practices.
Help your manager establish standards, design guidelines, and SOPs for analytical workflows, e.g., dashboard development, EDA, and ingestion of new datasets.


Who You Are...
