Optimizing data accessibility by improving data pipelines, maintaining data quality, and ensuring accuracy.
Automating and scaling reporting to reduce manual effort and enhance speed-to-insight.
Collaborating cross-functionally with teams such as Product, Operations, Risk, and Marketing to drive data-led initiatives.


You Should Apply If


You have demonstrated a business-first mindset at multiple companies, ability to frame problem statements from commercial, customer, and operational perspectives.
Strong proficiency in SQL and experience working with large datasets in cloud-based data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, etc.).
Experience with data visualization tools (e.g., Looker, Tableau, Power BI) to create self-serve dashboards.
Comfortable with data modeling and designing efficient, scalable analytics solutions.
A proactive, curious approach—someone who doesn’t just answer questions but finds the ones worth asking.
Ability to communicate complex data in a clear, actionable way for non-technical stakeholders.
Experience working in fintech, banking, or regulated industries is a plus.


🙌 What’s In It For You

We offer a competitive salary and a pretty great benefits package (if we do say so ourselves!)

💰 $135,000-175,000 + Equity

📍 This role is hybrid based out of our San Francisco office

📚 Learning budget of $1,500 a year for books, training courses and conferences

💰 Generous 401k with 4% employer match

Recidiviz is thrilled to be hiring a Policy Data Analyst to join our team! We're a small, fast-moving group that works with complex criminal justice data from our state partners and develops analyses and tools that target the drivers of incarceration. That's where you come in. We're looking for someone who has attention to detail to improve our analysis, creativity and inquisitiveness to identify and solve open-ended problems, clarity to think through complex and variable data, flexibility to adjust in a rapidly evolving environment, and above all else, a collaborative, kind nature to add to our culture.

About Us

Recidiviz is creating safer, healthier communities by improving outcomes for people in the criminal justice system. We build technology to reduce the number of people in prison and to help criminal justice leaders embrace data-driven decision-making.

Using software tools and thoughtful product design, we've been able to safely and permanently reduce incarceration and improve outcomes. We work side-by-side with leaders of the criminal justice system, people in prison and on supervision, and ecosystem partners to build a better path forward. In addition to the revenue we earn from state partners, some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations support our work.

People who succeed at Recidiviz lead with kindness and humility, assume good intent, learn from failure, and fix problems when they see them. They are excited to work arm in arm with government leadership and staff to improve outcomes. They are great listeners. They build deep relationships with and empathy for the people we work with and the people who our mission serves, even when those two groups feel at odds.

About The Role

Recidiviz's policy team supports state Department of Corrections (DOC) leaders that want to rewrite old policies or implement new ones, rooted in evidence and analytics, to improve outcomes, increase public safety and community health, and drive meaningful changes. We tailor data analysis, built on detailed DOC data, to answer questions like: What combination of criteria best select for probation clients who are safe to discharge? What static factors influence parole decisions today and how would that change if new, dynamic factors were added? How many people would X, Y, or Z adjustment to a policy affect and what can we say about the affected group? By translating concepts into concrete modeling, we help drive smarter and more ambitious change.

This role collaborates across several teams to guide work that targets the drivers of incarceration. Our Policy Data Analysts work with diverse data – criminal justice data both raw and processed from across the country, reports and policy documents from government agencies, and much more – to develop the policy analyses that deepen our understanding of the criminal justice system and motivate policy change. Our Policy Data Analysts translate policy concepts into quantitative metrics, perform analyses, and play a key role in contextualizing and presenting their analyses to stakeholders, both internal and external.

Travel of approximately one week per quarter may be required.

More about Recidiviz

Recidiviz was an all-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we've built an A-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator's 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.

Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) over 18 state partners – big and small, red and blue – and covers more than 40% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners – from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.

To learn more about how we do what we do, check out our 2024 Year in Review, read some press coverage, or watch our TED Talk. And if you're really keen to see our work, you can dive into our Github :).

An important note

Lasting change is always built on diversity. Recidiviz recruits, employs, trains, compensates and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, veteran status, ancestry, citizenship, marital status, gender identity and all protected status as required by applicable law. We consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you have a special need that requires accommodation, please let us know in your application. Even if you don't think you meet all the criteria above, drop your resume, and we'll take a look – you might be great for another role or another time!

Our job is to demonstrate how Google's products solve the world's problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental.

The Sports Data Analyst will play a pivotal role within Disney’s Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Sports Analytics team, supporting the transformation of how we measure, understand, and grow engagement across our sports portfolio. As part of a highly collaborative team that bridges ESPN and Disney Streaming, you'll work on end-to-end analytics workflows: from building foundational datasets and defining KPIs to surfacing insights that drive programming decisions, product optimizations, and marketing strategy.

You’ll partner closely with stakeholders across ESPN Programming, DTC Product, Research, Lifecycle Marketing, and Data Science. Your focus will span from deep-dives into tentpole events and deal performance (e.g., UFC PPVs, NHL games, ESPN+ integrations) to broader ecosystem analyses of fan behavior across streaming, web, and app platforms. Whether you're quantifying the impact of a new feature in the ESPN App or helping define success for a cross-platform sports launch, your work will directly shape the sports streaming experience for millions of fans.

The ideal candidate is equally comfortable exploring raw data and explaining their findings to senior executives, and thrives in an environment that blends sports passion with analytical rigor. This role offers a rare opportunity to sit at the center of one of the most dynamic intersections in media, where real-world sports moments meet digital innovation.

Key Responsibilities



Translate complex subscriber and engagement data into clear, actionable insights to support ESPN content strategy, product development, and marketing effectiveness
Conduct analyses to evaluate the performance of key sports events and programming partnerships (e.g., NHL, College Football, LaLiga), including real-time tentpole monitoring and post-event debriefs
Build and maintain dashboards that visualize trends in cross-platform engagement, fan behavior, and content performance
Develop new metrics and analytical frameworks (e.g., fandom tiering, ecosystem flows) to deepen understanding of how users interact with sports content
Partner with data engineering and product teams to define and improve foundational datasets and engagement pipelines used across the organization
Support product launches and feature rollouts with stakeholder-aligned KPIs, reporting workflows, and performance tracking
Communicate insights through presentations, written briefs, and stakeholder discussions, adapting content for both technical and executive audiences



Basic Qualifications



Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Data Science, Computer Science, Economics, or a related field
3+ years of hands-on experience conducting data analysis in a business or streaming/media context
Fluency in SQL, with the ability to query and transform large-scale behavioral datasets
Proficiency in Python or R for data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and statistical modeling
Experience building dashboards and visualizations in tools like Looker, Tableau, or other tools
Ability to distill complex findings into business-relevant recommendations



Preferred Qualifications



Background in streaming, digital media, or DTC subscription analytics
Experience working with Snowflake or other behavioral data platforms
Knowledge of sports content, fandom patterns, or seasonal audience dynamics
Comfort working across stakeholder groups, including programming, product, data science, and engineering
Exposure to predictive modeling, A/B testing, and experimentation frameworks
Familiarity with subscriber engagement, conversion funnels, or sports content performance metrics



Why Join Us?

Joining the Sports Analytics team means stepping into a uniquely cross-functional role that blends fan passion, business strategy, and technical execution. You'll be part of a high-impact team that:



Acts as the connective tissue between ESPN and Disney Streaming, bringing together behavioral data, strategic priorities, and audience insights to inform the future of sports at Disney
Tackles high-visibility, high-impact questions that influence league partnerships, product launches, subscriber engagement strategies, and cross-platform merchandising
Collaborates with elite analytics partners across Data Science, Product, Engineering, and Research to build models, tools, and measurement frameworks used across the company
Drives innovation through experimentation, data product development, and emerging methodologies, constantly seeking better ways to understand and grow fandom
Celebrates sports and storytelling, applying advanced analytics to bring clarity to the moments, players, and formats that move audiences



You’ll have the chance to work on real-time event reporting during major live sports moments, explore long-term trends in viewer behavior, and help shape how one of the world’s largest media companies delivers sports to fans. This is a team that values curiosity, collaboration, and creativity—and is building the next generation of sports analytics from the ground up.

In the last few years, we’ve built a banking app that our customers love – with extremely high daily engagement, an industry leading net promoter score, and award-winning customer support. We’ve raised over $1 billion from Capital G, Google’s growth fund, Ribbit Capital, TenCent, YCombinator, Stripe, Coatue, Eric Schmidt, Mike Moritz, and others - most recently at a $5 billion valuation.

We’re just getting started in the US. We’re an agile full stack team operating like an early stage startup but with the financial, operational, and engineering platform muscle of a larger company. We’re focused on building an amazing US product, shipping and iterating quickly, and deepening our product market fit. We’re looking for highly driven, enterprising people to help us achieve our mission to make money work for everyone.

The Role

We’re seeking business-savvy, impact-driven data analysts who can bridge the gap between data and decision-making. You’ll work across the business to proactively uncover insights, report performance trends, and enable self-serve analytics that empower stakeholders.

This role is ideal for someone who enjoys working in a fast-paced environment, understands business drivers, and can turn raw data into actionable insights.

You’ll Play a Key Role By


Proactively analyzing business performance by identifying trends, behaviors, and patterns across key metrics.
Developing self-serve analytics by building intuitive dashboards and reports that help teams access the data they need.
Supporting decision-making with ad-hoc analysis, deep dives, and strategic recommendations.
Optimizing data accessibility by improving data pipelines, maintaining data quality, and ensuring accuracy.
Automating and scaling reporting to reduce manual effort and enhance speed-to-insight.
Collaborating cross-functionally with teams such as Product, Operations, Risk, and Marketing to drive data-led initiatives.


You Should Apply If


You have demonstrated a business-first mindset at multiple companies, ability to frame problem statements from commercial, customer, and operational perspectives.
Strong proficiency in SQL and experience working with large datasets in cloud-based data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, etc.).
Experience with data visualization tools (e.g., Looker, Tableau, Power BI) to create self-serve dashboards.
Comfortable with data modeling and designing efficient, scalable analytics solutions.
A proactive, curious approach—someone who doesn’t just answer questions but finds the ones worth asking.
Ability to communicate complex data in a clear, actionable way for non-technical stakeholders.
Experience working in fintech, banking, or regulated industries is a plus.


🙌 What’s In It For You

We offer a competitive salary and a pretty great benefits package (if we do say so ourselves!)

💰 $135,000-175,000 + Equity

📍 This role is hybrid based out of our San Francisco office

📚 Learning budget of $1,500 a year for books, training courses and conferences

💰 Generous 401k with 4% employer match

Equal opportunities for everyone

Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we’re making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. At Monzo, we’re embracing diversity by fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.

Our early work was focused on the entertainment industry, specifically live events (Boston Calling, among others) and recorded music (Sony Music, Universal Music & Disney are all clients). We have dramatically grown our work with big brands (Amazon, Fender) and sports brands (LA Galaxy, Washington Commanders). We have a global client base with a growing local roster across B2B and B2C brands across campaign, content and branding assignments.




We are on the hunt for a talented Data Analyst to join our Strategy & Analytics team to assist with reporting, tracking, data analysis, advertising strategy, and visualization needs. In this role, you will work internally to assist paid media analysts with reporting requests as well as externally to provide clients with insights regarding their advertising campaigns.




If you are excited by the opportunity to improve reporting for our clients and our analysts, are able to communicate effectively to understand what tools will help solve a problem, and then work collaboratively to design a solution that’s scalable, accurate and easy-to-use, we want to talk to you.




Who You Are:

You have a true love for data. You have no problem tearing apart a problem and living inside a spreadsheet or data set to find the answer to any question.
You have advanced knowledge of SQL, Excel, and Google Data Studio/Data Visualization tools, and enjoy working with SQL on a day-to-day basis.
Experience with Marketing APIs, BigQuery or other cloud data warehouse tools (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks), ETL tools (such as Rivery, Looker, Supermetrics), and/or Python is a plus.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field and at least 1 year of experience working with marketing data and/or paid advertising campaigns, preferably in a fast-paced agency environment or team structure.

What You’ll Do:




Reporting:

Maintain customized dashboards in Google Sheets and Excel on a daily/weekly cadence.
Use Advanced Excel, SQL, and Google Data Studio/Visualization Tools to generate pivot tables and other visualizations summarizing thousands of lines of data.
Translate performance media metrics into clear, digestible reports for client advertising campaigns.
Communicate insights effectively through Google Slides or PowerPoint decks.




Strategy:

Learn our clients’ businesses and align media strategy with their business goals.
Analyze advertising trends within a single project and across multiple projects to guide media buying strategy.
Apply your background in paid media and/or digital advertising, including understanding concepts like LTV, ROAS, and Incremental Revenue.
Engage in discussions with clients to build trust and gain stakeholder buy-in on media strategy and results.




At Gupta Media, we work hard every day to be better at all that we do — and that includes fostering a diverse and inclusive community that encourages and respects a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and ideas. Join us and help us find the next great idea.
