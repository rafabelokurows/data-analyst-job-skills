If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good – you’ve come to the right place.

The Recruiting Analytics Insights & Research (RAIR) team is seeking a detail-oriented early to mid-career Analyst. As part of the Recruiting Organization and the larger people analytics umbrella at Salesforce, we act as strategic consultants for the Recruiting Organization, providing informed analysis and business acumen that challenge myths and status quo mindsets.

The RAIR team engages with stakeholders during critical moments, understanding their business needs and offering strategic, data-informed solutions with actionable recommendations.

This role will support and evolve some of our most critical and highly visible self-service dashboards as we develop agentic and conversational analytics products for Salesforce’s next generation of Workforce Planning and Recruiting Platforms.

Responsibilities


Apply data to solve complex problems.
Maintain and manage key Tableau dashboards, overseeing projects from inception to delivery.
Collaborate with cross-functional partners such as Finance, Workforce Planning, IT, and Data Engineering.
Adapt quickly to changing priorities to ensure timely delivery in a dynamic environment.
Automate manual processes to scale insights delivery.
While the role is eligible for remote candidates, some travel and time in the office will be required periodically depending on business needs and priorities.


Requirements For Success


3+ years of experience in data analytics, people analytics, or recruiting analytics
Intermediate SQL skills.
Experience with Tableau.
Basic proficiency in Python or higher.
Curiosity and willingness to grow and upskill in relevant knowledge, tools, and technical languages.

This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.

Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance and the Los Angeles Fair Chance Initiative for Hiring, Salesforce will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

For Washington-based roles, the base salary hiring range for this position is $87,700 to $120,600.

With a commitment to innovation and excellence, we have established ourselves as a trusted partner in the residential home building industry.

Position Overview

We’re looking for a hybrid Senior Data Engineer / Analyst to join our Operations and Analytics team, where we’re building the data engine that drives decision-making across the business. This isn’t just about reports—we’re here to turn messy, siloed data into actionable and reliable insights. We partner closely with leaders across GTM, Finance, Supply Chain, and Product to make data a strategic asset that’s trusted, accessible, and impactful.

What You’ll Do

You’ll own the full stack—from ingesting raw data to delivering polished dashboards and analysis. That includes:


30% – Design, build, and monitor ELT pipelines that land data from NetSuite, HubSpot, product logs, and other systems into Snowflake via dbt, Fivetran & Celigo.
25% – Own our dbt project: create well‑tested, documented models that power self‑service reporting and satisfy dimensional/semantic layer needs.
20% – Create exploratory analyses and stakeholder‑ready dashboards in Hex (and occasionally Looker/Tableau/Power BI) that illuminate operational KPIs across revenue, supply chain, forecasting, and e-commerce.
15% – Establish data‑quality SLAs and alerting (Snowflake tasks, dbt tests, Monte Carlo/Great Expectations, etc.) to keep trust high.
10% – Evangelize best practices: version control, CI/CD for analytics code, and analytics‑engineering mind‑set across the company.


What We’re Looking For


5+ years in data engineering/analytics, with at least 2 years owning a modern cloud warehouse (Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift).
Demonstrated experience with Fivetran or similar SaaS ELT tools; bonus points for Celigo flows.
Strong command of SQL, Python (or dbt Jinja), and Git workflows.
Deep hands-on experience with dbt—you know your staging, intermediate, and mart layers and insist on tests + docs.
Comfort in a notebook-based exploration environment (Hex or similar); you can translate ambiguity into sharp narratives with Markdown and visualizations.
Familiarity with business metrics, especially those tied to GTM operations, finance, and e-commerce.
Proven ability to collaborate with non-technical stakeholders to clarify vague requests and deliver data products that drive action.
Bonus: experience with orchestration tools (Airflow/Prefect), dbt Cloud, Monte Carlo/Great Expectations, or reverse‑ETL (e.g., Hightouch, Census).


What Success Looks Like (6–12 Months In)


Stakeholders trust the data—and data quality alerts catch issues before they do.
Your dbt models and dashboards enable leaders to make decisions fast—not wade through stale reports.
The executive dashboard pulls daily from Snowflake with <5 min latency.
Supply chain and e-commerce leaders are forecasting confidently, thanks to your data models.
You've created internal documentation and training sessions to level up data fluency across the company.
You’ve established coding standards for scalable analytics development.

This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.

Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance and the Los Angeles Fair Chance Initiative for Hiring, Salesforce will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

With a commitment to innovation and excellence, we have established ourselves as a trusted partner in the residential home building industry.

Position Overview

We’re looking for a hybrid Senior Data Engineer / Analyst to join our Operations and Analytics team, where we’re building the data engine that drives decision-making across the business. This isn’t just about reports—we’re here to turn messy, siloed data into actionable and reliable insights. We partner closely with leaders across GTM, Finance, Supply Chain, and Product to make data a strategic asset that’s trusted, accessible, and impactful.

What You’ll Do

You’ll own the full stack—from ingesting raw data to delivering polished dashboards and analysis. That includes:


30% – Design, build, and monitor ELT pipelines that land data from NetSuite, HubSpot, product logs, and other systems into Snowflake via dbt, Fivetran & Celigo.
25% – Own our dbt project: create well‑tested, documented models that power self‑service reporting and satisfy dimensional/semantic layer needs.
20% – Create exploratory analyses and stakeholder‑ready dashboards in Hex (and occasionally Looker/Tableau/Power BI) that illuminate operational KPIs across revenue, supply chain, forecasting, and e-commerce.
15% – Establish data‑quality SLAs and alerting (Snowflake tasks, dbt tests, Monte Carlo/Great Expectations, etc.) to keep trust high.
10% – Evangelize best practices: version control, CI/CD for analytics code, and analytics‑engineering mind‑set across the company.


What We’re Looking For


5+ years in data engineering/analytics, with at least 2 years owning a modern cloud warehouse (Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift).
Demonstrated experience with Fivetran or similar SaaS ELT tools; bonus points for Celigo flows.
Strong command of SQL, Python (or dbt Jinja), and Git workflows.
Deep hands-on experience with dbt—you know your staging, intermediate, and mart layers and insist on tests + docs.
Comfort in a notebook-based exploration environment (Hex or similar); you can translate ambiguity into sharp narratives with Markdown and visualizations.
Familiarity with business metrics, especially those tied to GTM operations, finance, and e-commerce.
Proven ability to collaborate with non-technical stakeholders to clarify vague requests and deliver data products that drive action.
Bonus: experience with orchestration tools (Airflow/Prefect), dbt Cloud, Monte Carlo/Great Expectations, or reverse‑ETL (e.g., Hightouch, Census).


What Success Looks Like (6–12 Months In)


Stakeholders trust the data—and data quality alerts catch issues before they do.
Your dbt models and dashboards enable leaders to make decisions fast—not wade through stale reports.
The executive dashboard pulls daily from Snowflake with <5 min latency.
Supply chain and e-commerce leaders are forecasting confidently, thanks to your data models.
You've created internal documentation and training sessions to level up data fluency across the company.
You’ve established coding standards for scalable analytics development.

We’re looking for highly driven, enterprising people to help us achieve our mission to make money work for everyone.

The Role

We’re seeking business-savvy, impact-driven data analysts who can bridge the gap between data and decision-making. You’ll work across the business to proactively uncover insights, report performance trends, and enable self-serve analytics that empower stakeholders.

Developing self-serve analytics by building intuitive dashboards and reports that help teams access the data they need.
Supporting decision-making with ad-hoc analysis, deep dives, and strategic recommendations.
Optimizing data accessibility by improving data pipelines, maintaining data quality, and ensuring accuracy.
Automating and scaling reporting to reduce manual effort and enhance speed-to-insight.
Collaborating cross-functionally with teams such as Product, Operations, Risk, and Marketing to drive data-led initiatives.


You Should Apply If


You have demonstrated a business-first mindset at multiple companies, ability to frame problem statements from commercial, customer, and operational perspectives.
Strong proficiency in SQL and experience working with large datasets in cloud-based data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, etc.).
Experience with data visualization tools (e.g., Looker, Tableau, Power BI) to create self-serve dashboards.
Comfortable with data modeling and designing efficient, scalable analytics solutions.
A proactive, curious approach—someone who doesn’t just answer questions but finds the ones worth asking.
Ability to communicate complex data in a clear, actionable way for non-technical stakeholders.
Experience working in fintech, banking, or regulated industries is a plus.


🙌 What’s In It For You

We offer a competitive salary and a pretty great benefits package (if we do say so ourselves!)

💰 $135,000-175,000 + Equity

📍 This role is hybrid based out of our San Francisco office

📚 Learning budget of $1,500 a year for books, training courses and conferences

💰 Generous 401k with 4% employer match

And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.

Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities. In fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.Our vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we’re creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality. Homeward supports Medicare-eligible beneficiaries by partnering with health plans, providers, and communities to align incentives – taking full financial accountability for clinical outcomes and the total cost of care across rural counties.As a public benefit corporation and Certified B Corp™, Homeward’s mission and business model are aligned to address the healthcare, economic, and demographic challenges that make it challenging for rural Americans to stay healthy. Our Homeward Navigation™ platform uses advanced analytics to connect members to the right care and local resources that address social determinants of health and improve holistic health outcomes. Since many rural communities lack adequate clinical capacity, Homeward also employs care teams that supplement local practices and reach people who cannot otherwise access care.Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo’s products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding. With this leadership team and funding, Homeward is committed to bringing high-quality healthcare to rural communities in need.

We’re waving goodbye to the complicated and confusing ways of traditional banking.

After starting as a prepaid card, our product offering has grown a lot in the last 10 years in the UK.

Hear from our UK team about what it's like working at Monzo ✨

About Monzo US

Monzo Group is a leading financial technology company, with over 9 million customers in the UK, committed to providing modern banking solutions. In the last few years, we’ve built a banking app that our customers love – with extremely high daily engagement, an industry leading net promoter score, and award-winning customer support. We’ve raised over $1 billion from Capital G, Google’s growth fund, Ribbit Capital, TenCent, YCombinator, Stripe, Coatue, Eric Schmidt, Mike Moritz, and others - most recently at a $5 billion valuation.

We’re just getting started in the US. We’re an agile full stack team operating like an early stage startup but with the financial, operational, and engineering platform muscle of a larger company. We’re focused on building an amazing US product, shipping and iterating quickly, and deepening our product market fit. We’re looking for highly driven, enterprising people to help us achieve our mission to make money work for everyone.

The Role

We’re seeking business-savvy, impact-driven data analysts who can bridge the gap between data and decision-making. You’ll work across the business to proactively uncover insights, report performance trends, and enable self-serve analytics that empower stakeholders.

This role is ideal for someone who enjoys working in a fast-paced environment, understands business drivers, and can turn raw data into actionable insights.

You’ll Play a Key Role By


Proactively analyzing business performance by identifying trends, behaviors, and patterns across key metrics.
Developing self-serve analytics by building intuitive dashboards and reports that help teams access the data they need.
Supporting decision-making with ad-hoc analysis, deep dives, and strategic recommendations.
Optimizing data accessibility by improving data pipelines, maintaining data quality, and ensuring accuracy.
Automating and scaling reporting to reduce manual effort and enhance speed-to-insight.
Collaborating cross-functionally with teams such as Product, Operations, Risk, and Marketing to drive data-led initiatives.


You Should Apply If


You have demonstrated a business-first mindset at multiple companies, ability to frame problem statements from commercial, customer, and operational perspectives.
Strong proficiency in SQL and experience working with large datasets in cloud-based data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, etc.).
Experience with data visualization tools (e.g., Looker, Tableau, Power BI) to create self-serve dashboards.
Comfortable with data modeling and designing efficient, scalable analytics solutions.
A proactive, curious approach—someone who doesn’t just answer questions but finds the ones worth asking.
Ability to communicate complex data in a clear, actionable way for non-technical stakeholders.
Experience working in fintech, banking, or regulated industries is a plus.


🙌 What’s In It For You

We offer a competitive salary and a pretty great benefits package (if we do say so ourselves!)

💰 $135,000-175,000 + Equity

📍 This role is hybrid based out of our San Francisco office

📚 Learning budget of $1,500 a year for books, training courses and conferences

💰 Generous 401k with 4% employer match

Equal opportunities for everyone

Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we’re making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. At Monzo, we’re embracing diversity by fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone. You can read more in our blog, 2024 Diversity and Inclusion Report and 2024 Gender Pay Gap Report.

We’re an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to age, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, or veteran, neurodiversity or disability status.

If you have a preferred name, please use it to apply. We don't need full or birth names at application stage 😊

As the leading end-to-end investment platform for single-family rental homes (SFR), our mission is to make real estate investing radically accessible, cost effective, and simple. We successfully merge our passion for helping investors build wealth through real estate with cutting edge technology that transforms the way they do it.




How it’s going (and growing)




With a talented team of 600+ Roofsters, our collaborative, can-do culture is what fuels our growth. In 2022, we closed on our Series E, raising $240 million, and have offices in California, Texas, and New York as well as many remote opportunities. Our growth includes recent acquisitions of Stessa (financial and asset management software), RentPrep (tenant screening and placement service for landlords), and Mynd (property management platform for both Retail and Institutional investors).

Strong proficiency in SQL and experience working with large datasets in cloud-based data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, etc.).
Experience with data visualization tools (e.g., Looker, Tableau, Power BI) to create self-serve dashboards.
Comfortable with data modeling and designing efficient, scalable analytics solutions.
A proactive, curious approach—someone who doesn’t just answer questions but finds the ones worth asking.
Ability to communicate complex data in a clear, actionable way for non-technical stakeholders.
Experience working in fintech, banking, or regulated industries is a plus.

From the house of dream to the house of talents

« Quoi que vous fassiez - pour le travail ou le plaisir - faites-le avec passion ! Vivez avec passion... »* Christian Dior

Christian Dior fut le couturier du rêve. Dès la fondation de sa Maison en 1947, marquée par la révolution du New Look, il métamorphose ses songes en de merveilleuses créations. Son esprit visionnaire n’a eu de cesse de magnifier les femmes du monde entier, inspirant aujourd’hui et plus que jamais ses successeurs. « Le tissu est le seul véhicule de nos rêves (…). La mode, en somme, est issue d’un rêve, et le rêve, c’est une évasion », écrivait-il dans son ouvrage Je suis couturier. Au fil de ses collections, Monsieur Dior est devenu le démiurge du bonheur de ses muses.

Aujourd’hui, riche de cet héritage d’exception et d’une communauté de plus de 7 500 talents, notre Maison incarne plus que jamais la Maison des Talents pensé par Christian Dior. Dans plus de 40 pays, nous faisons rayonner notre savoir-faire, notre audace et notre excellence à travers la passion et la créativité de nos collaborateurs. Rejoignez-nous et créez votre avenir dans notre univers généreux, disruptif et ambitieux où nous grandissons dans l’excellence, le courage et l’optimisme.

Pearl Health is powering the future of healthcare. We help primary care providers and organizations to deliver quality healthcare to the patients who need it most, when they need it most — and get rewarded for keeping patients healthy.

We are a team of physicians and public health experts (Stanford, Harvard, Mount Sinai), technologists (athenahealth, Amazon, Meta, Flatiron), healthcare innovators (Centivo, Aledade, Stellar, Arcadia), and experienced risk management professionals (CVS/Aetna, Humana, Oscar) who believe that primary care providers are the key to addressing our healthcare system’s biggest challenges.

Since its founding in 2020, Pearl has expanded to partner with thousands of primary care providers in practices and organizations across 44 states. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Viking Global Investors, AlleyCorp, and SV Angel.
