Getreu unserem Motto – People is what makes us us – sind uns deine nachhaltige Ausbildung und Weiterentwicklung, deine ausgeglichene Work-Life-Balance und deine Happiness sehr wichtig. Konkret stellen wir mit 32 Urlaubstagen, 60 % mobilem Arbeiten, bis zu 4 Wochen pro Jahr – im europäischen Ausland – der Möglichkeit remote zu arbeiten, Sabbatical und Überstundenausgleich sicher, dass dir im FUSE-Agentur-Leben nichts fehlt.

In unserem derzeit über 60-köpfigen Team sowie unseren Kund*innen haben wir unser perfektes Match bereits gefunden. Wenn du noch auf der Suche bist, bei „popkulturellem Relevanzmarketing“ neugierig wirst und für Social Media, Influencer Marketing oder Gaming & Esports brennst, dann lass uns zusammen loslegen! Denn : Action Creates Impact .

Dein Job

Als (Junior) Insights Analyst (mensch) bearbeitest du als Teil unseres Data und Analytics Teams in erster Linie die Anfragen unserer Kunden nach Social Media Reportings sowie Social Listening Analysen und beherrschst den Spagat zwischen analytischem und kreativem Denken, um die Kolleg:Innen in deinem und anderen Teams mit datenbasierten Insights zu Kundenmeinungen, Märkten, Zielgruppen, Marken und ihren Social Media-Umfeldern zu versorgen.

Dein Aufgabenbereich

Datenbeschaffung / Toolbedienung

Du bist präzise, schnell, zuverlässig und motiviert, wenn es um die manuelle Erfassung großer (Social Media)- Datenmengen geht, aber auch wissbegierig und begeisterungsfähig, dich diesbezüglich kontinuierlich mit Prozessoptimierung zu befassen, sowie dich in Tools und automatisierte Datenerfassungsprozesse und Methoden einzudenken, um immer bessere Lösungen zu finden.

Datenstrukturierung, Effiziente Datensammlung, Query Writing, Kategorisierung und Datendarstellung werden hier deine täglichen Begleiter.

Studiendurchführung

Von der (manchmal noch recht schwammigen) Fragestellung bis zum fertigen Analysebericht mit guten Insights und Handlungsempfehlungen ist es oft ein weiter aber spannender Weg. Der kann bald auch deiner sein, gemeinsam mit uns im Team.

Du hast ein sehr gutes Gespür für Sprache und Kommunikation? Nice, das brauchst du hier in mindestens dreierlei Hinsicht: Erstens, um aus den Aussagen und Briefings unserer Auftraggeber herausfiltern zu können, wie du ihnen am besten weiterhelfen kannst. Zweitens, wenn es darum geht, die Essenz von Konsumenten-Posts und Kommentaren auf Social Media zu verstehen, schließlich ist Inhaltanalyse unser Daily-Business. Und Drittens, um dann Deine Findings Zielgruppengerecht rüberzubringen - in Reports, in Meetings und bei Präsentationen.

Datenanalyse

Auswertungslogiken passend zu den gegebenen Fragestellungen und Erkenntnisinteressen erstellen, Dimensionierungen & Kategorisierungen für Inhaltsanalysen planen und entwickeln, Daten auszählen, filtern, darstellen, vergleichen, interpretieren, daraus kreative Idee und Empfehlungen ableiten. Das ist dein Playground. Deine Affinität zu Zahlen und Daten kannst du hier immer wieder beweisen. Ein stets strukturiertes Vorgehen und ein souveräner Umgang auch mit großen und komplexen Datenmengen, Statistiken und Zahlen sind für dich selbstverständlich.

Spezielle Social Media Analyse-Tools wirst Du ebenso (kennenlernen und) zum Einsatz bringen wie ganz viel Excel und das gute alte Powerpoint.

Das bringst du mit

Du kannst (erste) Erfahrung in der qualitativen und quantitativen Forschungsarbeit, sowie in der marketing- oder kundenorientierten Projektarbeit vorweisen und hast Lust dich im Bereich Social Media Analytics weiter auszutoben. Du hast, dank deines Studiums, einen kommunikations-, sozial- oder medienwissenschaftlichen Background und bringst Kenntnisse der Methoden im Bereich der quantitativen und qualitativen Marktforschung mit. Du hast neben den analytischen Fähigkeiten, auch ein Gespür für gute kreative Kommunikation und Lust, diese mitzuentwickeln. Du bist organisiert und selbständig, willst aber auch noch ständig ganz viel lernen und verstehst dich als Teamplayer, der immer auf Höhe des Zeitgeists ist und daraus neue Impulse für unsere Teams und Kunden ableitet. Außerdem hast Du sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse in Wort und Schrift, sehr gute MS Office Kenntnisse, insbesondere Excel und PowerPoint und bist im besten Fall mit Analytics Tools im Bereich Social Listening & Web Analytics vertraut.

Darum wir

Als Teil der FUSE erfährst du stets Rückenwind von deinem Team, arbeitest für Kunden - die unsere Werte „BOLD. TRUE. EASY. TOGETHER.“ leben und kannst aktiv Prozesse und Strukturen mitentwickeln. Denn ganz getreu unserem Wert TOGETHER setzen wir auf das Potential im Team. Neben unvergesslichen Events bieten wir dir viel Raum für persönliche und berufliche Weiterentwicklung.

Über uns

Wir sind ein aktives Netzwerk aus Kleintierpraxen und -kliniken in ganz Deutschland. Unsere Mission: “Gemeinsam arbeiten wir daran, täglich das beste Erlebnis für Tier und Mensch zu schaffen.”

Für uns bedeutet das, die Arbeitsbedingungen für Tierärztinnen, Tierärzte und TFA kontinuierlich zu verbessern. So sorgen wir z. B. für familienfreundliche Arbeitszeiten, moderne Praxisausstattungen, innovative Technologien und wir investieren in eine netzwerkinterne Fort- & Weiterbildungsakademie. Diese Investitionen stärken unsere Praxisteams und verbessern das Erlebnis für Tiere und Kund:innen nachhaltig.

Unsere Gemeinschaft ist geprägt von der Vielfalt im Netzwerk. Wir schätzen einander und berücksichtigen die Expertise und Ziele jedes Mitarbeitenden. Dafür fördern wir den Austausch zwischen den Praxen.

Als Netzwerk können wir die vielen Herausforderungen der Branche, wie Fachkräftemangel, hohe Arbeitsbelastung und veraltete Praktiken bewältigen und eine nachhaltige Tiergesundheit sicherstellen.

In vielen Regionen sind wir bereits aktiv: Dort erhalten und schaffen wir tiermedizinische Versorgungsstrukturen. Seit unserer Gründung 2019 hat sich Tierarzt Plus Partner als überregionales Netzwerk für Tierarztpraxen etabliert.

Unser Berliner Zentralteam unterstützt die lokalen Praxis-Teams in den Bereichen Praxismanagement, Marketing, Personal, Digitalisierung und Finanzen. Ob in der Zentrale oder vor Ort in der Praxis - uns verbindet unsere Vision: “Gesunde Tiermedizin, partnerschaftlich leben.”

About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of more than 240 employees from over 40 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of more than 240 employees from over 40 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

Want to make an impact? Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.




We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.




Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, we work closely with our teams in Barcelona, San Antonio, Spokane, and remote locations. We’ve got a reputation for being a great place to work, having been named among the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Seattle Business Magazine and Washington’s Best Workplaces in the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies.




At Rover, our furry coworkers are just as important as our human ones—and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Along with making the joys of pet parenthood more accessible, we’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community of pet people—and that starts with our employees.




Who we're looking for:




The Marketing Analytics team supports the company’s marketing efforts, while also working with teams throughout the organization. The analytics team is responsible for a number of business-critical reports and data models that our global marketing teams rely on for daily reporting, budgeting, and analysis. We measure marketing attribution to understand how people become Rover customers, provide campaign reporting to monitor trends in cost efficiency and optimization, deliver lifecycle data to action against a variety of customer behaviors, and narrate the business to identify and prioritize new opportunities.

We are specifically looking for a Business Analyst III to single-handedly support our Customer Retention Marketing and Blog programs, which have touch points with 5-6 million unique users monthly. This analyst will act as a trusted thought partner to marketing stakeholders with a focus on overhauling data infrastructure, driving measurable outcomes, optimizing our brand content strategy, and scaling cross-sell programs across our many customer engagement channels. They will have experience operating autonomously to deliver on complex, cross-functional initiatives.




*This is a hybrid position that has the minimum expectation to work out of our Barcelona Office in the Poblenou neighborhood two days per week on Mondays and Thursdays. For this reason, candidates must be based in Barcelona or willing to relocate.




Your Responsibilities:

Build the lifecycle data infrastructure from the ground up – defining our measurement strategy (A/B tests, rotating holdouts, etc.), building conversion-based datasets for near-real-time customer interactions, and facilitating an expansion into push notifications and paid reactivation campaigns
Partner with our global brand team to optimize our brand content across multiple channels, including email, blog, and organic channels.
Own the cross-sell analytical functions for our email and blog programs, growing the reach of our brand voice to new target audiences.
Influence the global strategy of your partner teams by crafting and refining key performance indicators that measure the health of our business




Your Qualifications:

At least 4 years experience working cross-functionally with complex datasets to support organizational decision making.
Fluency in SQL. You would feel confident reviewing code produced by other analysts and data scientists, as well as assisting non-technical colleagues with their reports in an office hours setting.
Hands-on experience running A/B tests as well as expertise in statistical analysis
Familiarity with programming in Python or R.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Specifically, you know how to narrate models and results to business partners in a useful, concise, and meaningful way.
Experience working with cross-functional business partners to define business problems, scope project deliverables/timelines, implement reporting solutions, and frame organizational strategy.
You prioritize your work on impact to the business and can gracefully push back on stakeholders




Nice to Have:

Two-sided marketplace and/or marketing analytics experience
Understanding of digital touchpoints and measurement mechanisms
Marketing analytics with a focus on customer lifecycle marketing
Meaningful experience processing large data sets at scale. This could include languages like Python or R, as well as frameworks like Spark, Hive, or dbt.
Experience with AWS (Redshift, S3, EMR)
Understanding of modeling techniques, such as linear regressions, causal impact models, and bootstrapping. You know the trade-offs of each of these models and can propose the right model for the test at hand




Benefits of working at Rover:

Competitive compensation
Long-term incentive plan with a company performance-based cash payout
Permanent contract
Pension Plan
Meal tickets through Cobee
Generous PTO Allowance
Hybrid Work Model: In-office days on Mondays and Thursdays, with remote work the rest of the week.
Private health insurance
Discounted Gym Membership
Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time)
Monetary help for adopting a dog plus yearly credit to use on our platform
Flexible work hours, sometimes you’ll need to be in at certain times, but on the whole, we’re pretty flexible when it comes to managing workload and time
Grab snacks, fresh fruit, in our kitchen to keep yourself going
Regular team activities, including happy hours, game nights, and more

About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of more than 240 employees from over 40 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

Want to make an impact? Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.




We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.




Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, we work closely with our teams in Barcelona, San Antonio, Spokane, and remote locations. We’ve got a reputation for being a great place to work, having been named among the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Seattle Business Magazine and Washington’s Best Workplaces in the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies.




At Rover, our furry coworkers are just as important as our human ones—and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Along with making the joys of pet parenthood more accessible, we’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community of pet people—and that starts with our employees.




Who we're looking for:




The Marketing Analytics team supports the company’s marketing efforts, while also working with teams throughout the organization. The analytics team is responsible for a number of business-critical reports and data models that our global marketing teams rely on for daily reporting, budgeting, and analysis. We measure marketing attribution to understand how people become Rover customers, provide campaign reporting to monitor trends in cost efficiency and optimization, deliver lifecycle data to action against a variety of customer behaviors, and narrate the business to identify and prioritize new opportunities.

We are specifically looking for a Business Analyst III to single-handedly support our Customer Retention Marketing and Blog programs, which have touch points with 5-6 million unique users monthly. This analyst will act as a trusted thought partner to marketing stakeholders with a focus on overhauling data infrastructure, driving measurable outcomes, optimizing our brand content strategy, and scaling cross-sell programs across our many customer engagement channels. They will have experience operating autonomously to deliver on complex, cross-functional initiatives.




*This is a hybrid position that has the minimum expectation to work out of our Barcelona Office in the Poblenou neighborhood two days per week on Mondays and Thursdays. For this reason, candidates must be based in Barcelona or willing to relocate.




Your Responsibilities:

Build the lifecycle data infrastructure from the ground up – defining our measurement strategy (A/B tests, rotating holdouts, etc.), building conversion-based datasets for near-real-time customer interactions, and facilitating an expansion into push notifications and paid reactivation campaigns
Partner with our global brand team to optimize our brand content across multiple channels, including email, blog, and organic channels.
Own the cross-sell analytical functions for our email and blog programs, growing the reach of our brand voice to new target audiences.
Influence the global strategy of your partner teams by crafting and refining key performance indicators that measure the health of our business




Your Qualifications:

At least 4 years experience working cross-functionally with complex datasets to support organizational decision making.
Fluency in SQL. You would feel confident reviewing code produced by other analysts and data scientists, as well as assisting non-technical colleagues with their reports in an office hours setting.
Hands-on experience running A/B tests as well as expertise in statistical analysis
Familiarity with programming in Python or R.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills. Specifically, you know how to narrate models and results to business partners in a useful, concise, and meaningful way.
Experience working with cross-functional business partners to define business problems, scope project deliverables/timelines, implement reporting solutions, and frame organizational strategy.
You prioritize your work on impact to the business and can gracefully push back on stakeholders




Nice to Have:

Two-sided marketplace and/or marketing analytics experience
Understanding of digital touchpoints and measurement mechanisms
Marketing analytics with a focus on customer lifecycle marketing
Meaningful experience processing large data sets at scale. This could include languages like Python or R, as well as frameworks like Spark, Hive, or dbt.
Experience with AWS (Redshift, S3, EMR)
Understanding of modeling techniques, such as linear regressions, causal impact models, and bootstrapping. You know the trade-offs of each of these models and can propose the right model for the test at hand




Benefits of working at Rover:

Competitive compensation
Long-term incentive plan with a company performance-based cash payout
Permanent contract
Pension Plan
Meal tickets through Cobee
Generous PTO Allowance
Hybrid Work Model: In-office days on Mondays and Thursdays, with remote work the rest of the week.
Private health insurance
Discounted Gym Membership
Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time)
Monetary help for adopting a dog plus yearly credit to use on our platform
Flexible work hours, sometimes you’ll need to be in at certain times, but on the whole, we’re pretty flexible when it comes to managing workload and time
Grab snacks, fresh fruit, in our kitchen to keep yourself going
Regular team activities, including happy hours, game nights, and more




Rover is an equal-opportunity employer committed to promoting a diverse, inclusive, and inventive environment with the best employees.

Our sensors are already being used in the field, and demand is growing fast. We’re looking for a hands-on Data Science Working Student to help us analyze large volumes of sensor data and develop machine learning models to improve sensor calibration and field performance.




You'll join our R&D team at an exciting moment: scaling a breakthrough technology from 1 to 100. This is not just a typical data cleaning job — it's a technical, dynamic role where you'll explore real-world sensor data, build predictive models, validate algorithms, and help design the data pipelines that will scale our technology globally.


Tasks



Analyze large, real-world sensor datasets from field deployments


Develop and validate machine learning models to improve sensor calibration and data interpretation


Build and maintain data pipelines and workflows for sensor data processing


Support the design of algorithms for real-time sensor monitoring and diagnostics


Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, anomalies, and improvement opportunities


Collaborate closely with R&D engineers to translate raw data into actionable insights


Document your work clearly for internal use and future scaling



Requirements



You are enrolled in a Bachelor’s or Master’s program in Physics, Mathematics, Data Science, Computer Science, Engineering or a related field


Strong experience with Python (including libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, matplotlib)


Solid understanding of data analysis, statistics, and machine learning fundamentals


First experience with real-world, noisy datasets (e.g., from sensors, lab experiments, or research projects)


Familiarity with basic software engineering practices (e.g., Git, version control, writing clean code)


Hands-on mentality: you enjoy solving technical challenges, even when data is messy


(Bonus) Experience with time-series data, signal processing, or calibration models


(Bonus) Familiarity with cloud tools (e.g., AWS, GCP) or database management (e.g., SQL, InfluxDB)



Benefits



Mission-driven work: your work will directly contribute to building climate solutions based on real, measurable impact


Hands-on learning: work directly with our Head of R&D and CEO, gaining first-hand experience in next-generation data science methods, real-world sensor analytics, and leveraging large language models (LLMs) in practice to 10x your data science work


Growth opportunity: as we scale, you’ll have the chance to take on more responsibility or specialize in areas like machine learning, data engineering, or scientific computing


Startup vibe, real impact: small, collaborative team, flat hierarchy, and the opportunity to see your work go into production quickly


Benefits: paid vacation, healthcare, retirement plan, free snacks & good coffee, and a beautiful Berlin office with lab and workshop space





We Would Love to Hear From You




We understand that you might not fit all of the requirements above perfectly. We envision our team to be as diverse as the solutions that will solve the climate crisis. Forming a compassionate workplace is a core part of our culture – including all walks of life, experiences, and perspectives. Candidates from structurally underrepresented cultures and backgrounds are especially encouraged to apply.

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

About the role

The Data Analyst works within the Data Team, using and transforming data from multiple sources to produce high quality, digestible reports, dashboards, and bespoke pieces of analysis for our fundraising and alumni colleagues. You will also lead on any benchmarking projects, both the submission of data and the interpretation and presentation of their findings. Being a clear communicator of often complex information, you will deliver insight into the performance of our various fundraising and engagement programmes, giving colleagues the information they need to continually innovate and improve.

In addition, you will have a raft of technical skills and approaches that will enable you to efficiently transform source data from multiple data sources ready for import into our Dynamics CRM system.

You will be keen to learn and develop, embracing new technologies and ways of working, and will work with the Data Team and others across the department to improve the quality of the underlying data we all rely on. You will also work closely with others in the team, IT colleagues and other users across the organisation to shape future CRM features.

You will be required to liaise and work collaboratively with other teams on new fundraising projects and initiatives, thereby ensuring a joined-up approach, that future reporting requirements can be met, with learning shared and insight retained. You will often need to manage multiple requests and prioritise your workload, albeit we have adopted an Agile approach to development.

This is a full time post (35 hours per week), and you will be offered an indefinite contract. P&A has a hybrid working approach, with a minimum of 40% of time in the office. Typically, this equates to two days per week, but we’re very happy for colleagues to be in more frequently if they so wish.

Essential criteria

Knowledge of data insight, analysis and reporting techniques
Significant experience of working with a fundraising or marketing CRM in a technical, database management or report writing capacity

Contract: Permanent, Full-time (36 hours per week)

Salary: £37,007 - £38,821 (inclusive of London Weighting)

Benefits: 28 days holiday plus public holidays, Local Government Pension Scheme, Cycle to Work scheme, Employee Assistance Programme

About Us – West London Waste Authority (WLWA)

WLWA is a statutory public body responsible for managing waste disposal for six London boroughs: Brent, Ealing, Harrow, Hillingdon, Hounslow and Richmond upon Thames. Working on behalf of over 1.7 million residents, we manage the treatment, transfer and disposal of waste and recycling that local councils collect.

We coordinate complex waste operations, liaise with multiple contractors and public sector partners, and deliver environmental services with a focus on efficiency and sustainability. As the sector becomes more data-driven, we are investing in the way we collect, manage and use information across borough boundaries.

Make Public Sector Data Work Better Across Borough Boundaries

To support this transformation, we’re looking for a Data & Business Intelligence Analyst (internally known as “MI Analyst”) who can work confidently at the intersection of data, systems and people.

This role is for someone who can build robust, insightful reports — while also working collaboratively across boroughs, finance teams and contractors to align data capture and reporting.

This is a delivery-focused position with the opportunity to shape how information flows between organisations and influences operational, financial and environmental decision-making.

What You'll Do


Design, build and maintain automated dashboards and reporting tools using Power BI, DAX, Power Query, and SQL
Gather, validate and integrate data from boroughs and contractors, ensuring consistency and quality
Support statutory data returns (e.g. Waste Data Flow) and produce management and financial reports
Investigate discrepancies, spot data issues early, and engage constructively with partners to resolve them
Collaborate closely with internal colleagues and external stakeholders to deliver improvements in reporting accuracy, usability and efficiency
Provide mentoring and task oversight to the MI Assistant to ensure consistent data practices across the team.


The Environment You’ll Be Working In

This role spans multiple organisations with differing systems and priorities. It requires a proactive, analytical approach — and the ability to build trust and shared understanding across stakeholders.


You’ll need to communicate clearly, work interactively with others, and respond effectively to requests and issues as they arise.
The role involves real-time collaboration and engagement as part of day-to-day delivery, especially when resolving data queries or aligning reporting practices.


Essential Skills And Experience


Proven experience using Power BI, including DAX, Power Query, and data modelling techniques
Strong skills in SQL or T-SQL for transforming, cleansing and integrating data
Experience working with large, complex datasets from multiple sources
Ability to identify, explain and resolve data issues through direct engagement with stakeholders
Evidence you can drive a data issue to resolution – e.g. persuading a partner to correct their feed, coaching non-technical colleagues, or thrashing it out on a live call until the numbers balance.
Experience working in a setting where cross-organisational collaboration or partner engagement was key to delivery


Highly Desirable Experience working in or with local government or public sector data.


Understanding of environmental or waste management data
Familiarity with statutory data submission processes or financial reconciliation reporting
Hands-on data-engineering capability, ideally including: Designing and building a lakehouse architecture, Implementing Azure access-management controls, Setting up row-level security for Power BI reports


Why Join WLWA?

We’re a small, mission-driven organisation with wide reach and big ambitions. You’ll work in a role that combines technical hands-on data work with the chance to improve public services across six London boroughs.

We Offer


28 days annual leave plus public holidays
Membership of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS)
Opportunities to lead on meaningful improvements in data processes and reporting
A varied, cross-organisational working environment with real-world impact

We welcome applications from all backgrounds and actively encourage people who bring diverse perspectives to apply. If you can combine strong technical skills with the ability to build relationships, explain complexity clearly, and drive improvement across varied stakeholders — we want to hear from you.

We are committed to creating an inclusive, diverse workplace and welcome applications from all backgrounds.

📍West London (3 days a week on-site)

💸£55,000 – £60,000




About the Company

A leading name in the UK property sector is on the hunt for a mid-level Data Analyst to join their growing data team. With a strong foundation in Business Intelligence and a forward-thinking approach to tech, this company has spent the last five years investing heavily in their data infrastructure and are now gearing up to take things even further — including AI implementation over the next 6–12 months. 🚀




They're working on internal data projects with real commercial impact and are looking for someone who can not only crunch the numbers, but also tell the story behind them.




The Role

You’ll take the lead on key analytics initiatives, working end-to-end across data pipelines, visualisation, and stakeholder communication. It’s a hands-on role with plenty of variety — perfect for someone who enjoys making sense of messy data and translating that into insight that drives decisions.




You'll also play a key part in their early AI-driven projects, focused on improving sales processes and customer interactions through transcript analysis and intelligent feedback tools.




What You’ll Be Doing

📈 Lead dashboard development using Power BI, delivering enterprise-grade reports that drive business insight
🔍 End-to-end data analysis, from extraction and transformation to insight using SQL and Python
🗣️ Present findings to stakeholders across all levels, breaking down complex analysis into clear, commercial terms
👥 Run workshops/training to help non-technical users engage with dashboards and tools
🤖 Contribute to AI initiative, including mining sales call data, building feedback prompts, and extracting insights from customer conversations




The Ideal Candidate

Has spent a few years working in data-focused roles, with solid hands-on experience in real-world commercial environments.
Brings a strong academic foundation, ideally in a technical or numerical subject such as Maths, Physics, Engineering, or Computer Science.
Comfortable owning projects end-to-end, from working with raw data to presenting insights that drive business decisions.
A confident communicator who can explain complex analysis in a simple, engaging way.
Technically fluent with Power BI, SQL, and Python, and eager to work with modern tools like Fabric and Copilot.
Curious, analytical, and thrives in a fast-paced, collaborative setting.




💡 This role is ideal for someone looking to step into a more visible, hands-on position where they can shape how data is used across a business — and get early exposure to AI innovation in a real-world commercial setting.

We are RAPP – world leaders in activating growth with precision and empathy at scale. As a global, next-generation precision marketing agency we leverage data, creativity, technology, and empathy to foster client growth. We champion individuality in the marketing solutions we create, and in our workplace. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviours, and aspirations. We foster an inclusive workplace that emphasizes personal well-being.

MARKETING SCIENCES

The Marketing Sciences team at RAPP is a driving force behind the agency's success, harnessing the power of data and technology. We are superconnectors, bridging the gap between creativity, data and tech to unlock limitless possibilities and disruption.

Our mission is to provide deep insights and a true robust understanding of our clients' businesses and marketing challenges. Our expertise is to empower our agency and the client to make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and drive measurable results.

From identifying the untapped value of client data to expanding its potential through data capture, rigorous analysis, and statistical techniques, we leave no stone unturned. We are split into 4 disciplines in Marketing Sciences; Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Enablement and Data Visualisation to enable us to deliver against any client data driven challenge.

Together, we will revolutionize the way data is utilised, ensuring that every action we take contributes to the success of our clients and propels the agency forward. Welcome to a future where data and technology and your ideas push the boundaries of what's possible.

YOUR ROLE

In the Data Analytics team you will ensure both the voice of the customer and CFO are represented in the room with hard evidence. As well as supporting exceptional customer experiences using data, you will help ensure every action we take is directly improving performance against your clients objectives.

As an Analyst, you will work under supervision to deliver projects within set deadlines, utilising your strong hands on analytical capabilities. Your strengths in Python and SQL will ensure you can efficiently deliver robust analytics with guidance from your team.

Your experience with web and social analytics tools (GA / Adobe / Brandwatch / Sprinklr) and data visualisation tools (Power BI / Tableau / Looker / etc) will enable you to uncover key insights across channels and create self-service dashboards.

You will be comfortable working as part of a team with supervision from seniors, whilst being able to execute analysis independently.

Whilst no two days will look the same, you’ll be sharing findings back to more senior members of the team to shape for articulation to clients.

Under the guidance of senior members of the team you support answering strategic questions using data and forge an understanding of how to deliver personalisation at scale.

In Data Analytics you won’t be expected to build advanced segmentations and data science models, but you will develop an understanding of the art of the possible with data science, the necessary data required to fuel models and an ability to spot where a business challenge would be best supported through automation or leveraging the latest modelling techniques.

You will have a developing interest with the omni-channel landscape and be able to develop a strong understanding of how to capture and utilise data across channels, from creating tagging and taxonomy to measurement with web analytics tools.

Once you join the team, you will be onboarded to our product suite and playbooks and be capable of articulating and following these best-in-class approaches.

The ideal candidate is ready to jump in. Find problems. Fix them. Build relationships. Stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Do whatever it takes to go above and beyond. And stand up for individuality.

This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you’ll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


10+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights
Demonstrated ability to influence the strategic direction of stakeholders
Experience mentoring junior data analysts



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$174,400 - C$261,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

The Future is Omnichain.

Founded in 2021, LayerZero’s vision is to create a community of cross-chain developers, building dApps that are no longer constrained by individual blockchain capabilities.

We are funded by the best investors in the world including:

a16z, Sequoia, PayPal, Binance Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Uniswap Labs, Circle Ventures, Delphi Digital, and many more.

About The Role

As we continue to grow at LayerZero, we're faced with an exciting set of challenges: more data, more developers, more teams, more projects, and more opportunities for innovation. To tackle these problems head-on, we're expanding our data team with a dedicated Data Analyst.

As a Data Analyst at LayerZero, you'll be at the forefront of shaping a rich data foundation for a company that's making a real impact in the web3 space. You'll work closely with teams and leaders to uncover insights, drive decision-making, and fuel our next-generation products and services.

What You’ll Do

As a key member of the data team at LayerZero, you'll be diving headfirst into the world of crypto data - exploring on-chain wallets and contracts, block and transaction data, insights from in-house systems, and third-party intelligence. Your mission will be to combine these diverse datasets into rich, actionable data products for a broad group of stakeholders.


Leveraging and expanding our ever-growing Kimball dimensional model.
Writing SQL to create and expand insights in our in-house reporting solutions.
Collaborating with stakeholders across the organization to conduct ad-hoc explorations and analytics - from engineering questions to help understand production issues to product insights that illuminate the broader crypto landscape.
Be a key owner of data quality, building out insights that serve the data team itself to help guide our data efforts towards cleaner and richer data.
Compose pipelines by writing SQL code to clean, combine, refine, and aggregate data into the insights the organization needs.
Collaborating on new datasets to ingest into our Snowflake data warehouse, working closely with data engineers on your team.
Not afraid of pushing code that supports tens of billions of dollars in daily transaction volume.


About You

We are looking for someone with previous data analyst experience. Likely with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Physics or related field, but we also consider and highly value equivalent practical experience.

Required


Strong SQL knowledge and experience
Proven track record in data modeling, statistics, and analytics
Experience working with a broad range of stakeholders
Strong convictions weakly held.
You enjoy working in a fast-paced start-up environment, where you'll need to take initiative and solve problems independently.
You understand the importance of data quality through incremental data development.


Bonus


Experience with general programming, we use Python and Go on the data stack
Experience with Snowflake
Experience building DAG based data pipelines
Experience with streaming real-time data pipelines

Constructor powers product search and discovery for some of the largest retailers in the world, like Sephora and Petco. We serve billions of requests every day, and you've probably seen our results somewhere and used our product without knowing it. We differentiate ourselves by focusing on metrics over features, and reinventing search and discovery from the ground up as a machine learning challenge with the specific goal of improving metrics like revenue. We have grown several hundred percent YoY for the last 2 years and have customers in every eCommerce vertical, around the world, and spanning many languages.

We're a passionate team of technologists who love solving problems and want to make our customers' and coworkers' lives better. We value empathy, openness, curiosity, continuous improvement, and are excited by metrics that matter. We believe that empowering everyone in a company to do what they think is best can lead to great things.

Data Science Integrations team

Providing measurable KPI lifts is the goal of our platform, and most customers want to prove it running an A/B-test against either an in-house solution or one of our competitors.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you’ll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


10+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights
Demonstrated ability to influence the strategic direction of stakeholders
Experience mentoring junior data analysts



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$174,400 - C$261,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.
