Are you excited to use data to accelerate social impact? Will you help ensure that Welcome app becomes a smarter, more insight-driven organisation? Keep reading!




What is Welcome app?

Imagine trying to build a new life in a foreign country – from scratch. Where do you start? Information isn't easily accessible, you don’t yet speak the language, and you don’t know how to meet new people. Many newcomers in the Netherlands face this exact challenge.




Welcome app makes building a new life easier. We do this by making relevant information, activities, services and local organisations accessible in one place: the Welcome app. In doing so, we support municipalities in effectively carrying out their responsibilities, and offer civic organisations a platform to reach newcomers. Our technology fosters integration, participation, self-reliance, and equal access to opportunities.




We are growing, and to strengthen our data-driven way of working, we’re now looking for a Data Analyst.


Who are we looking for?

As a Data Analyst, you’ll support the team in collecting, managing, and analysing data from multiple sources – such as our platform, Power BI CRM (Hubspot), marketing channels and impact and SROI evaluations . You play a key role in structuring this data and translating it into actionable insights to support better decision-making across product, sales and marketing, and our efforts to scale our social impact.




You will work closely with our Go-to-Market Manager, product team, and CEO, and contribute to the development of dashboards, reports and analyses that help move the organisation forward. You’ll have plenty of space to learn, experiment and take ownership of your domain.




What will you be doing?
Mapping and managing available and needed data sources (product, CRM, market, users)
Creating, maintaining, and improving internal datasets and dashboards
Analysing user behaviour, retention, adoption and conversion on our platform
Supporting the design and delivery of impact measurement and reports for municipalities and other stakeholders
Contributing to A/B testing, KPI tracking and experiments within product and marketing
Supporting the team with ad hoc analyses and insight-driven decision-making
Helping to strengthen a data-informed working culture within Welcome app




What are we looking for?Required:
2+ years of experience in a role focused on data, analysis or research
Familiarity with tools like Power BI, Google Analytics, Tableau or other data visualisation tools
Affinity with social challenges, impact measurement or digital products
Accuracy, independence, and curiosity – you see patterns and ask questions
Strong analytical skills and the ability to explain complex information in simple terms
Good command of English, written and spoken, knowledge or command of Dutch is advantageous but not necessary




Preferred:
Familiarity with a range of tools for data analysis and visualisation in a tech or start-up environment
Experience with developing dashboards, impact reporting, or working with public/open data
Shared or lived experience with migration, integration or social inclusion is a plus




What do we offer?
Start date: preferably june 2024
A parttime or fulltime position
Salary between €2,500 – €2,900 gross per month (based on full-time, depending on experience)
Free lunch at our centrally located office in Amsterdam
Flexible, hybrid and remote working options
A multidisciplinary, mission-driven team within a growing start-up
Lots of room for growth, initiative and professional development




Ready to make a difference with data?

Send your CV and a short motivation to hr@welcomeapp.nl. Questions? Feel free to reach out – we’re happy to help you think this through!




We review applications on a rolling basis. Applications without a motivation letter will not be considered.

En als Verloning Specialist draag jij daar direct aan bij. Zo ben jij ervoor verantwoordelijk dat onze bezorgers op tijd en correct worden uitbetaald. Dus kies je voor knalgeel met een vleugje rood? Dan maak jij binnenkort het verschil voor duizenden verzenders en ontvangers over de hele wereld.




Dit ga je doen

Dagelijks brengen ruim 8.000 bezorgers de pakketten van klanten rond in onze herkenbare gele busjes. Deze bezorgers zijn een cruciaal onderdeel van ons logistieke proces. Het is dus van groot belang dat hun salarisbetaling op tijd komt en kloppend is. In jouw rol als Verloning Specialist draag jij hier zorg voor.




Jouw werk bestaat uit twee hoofdtaken, namelijk:

Continuïteit: het uitvoeren van de bestaande dagelijkse werkzaamheden (uitvoeren mutaties en beantwoorden complexe vragen) en maandelijkse processen (uitvoeren verloning) om ons verloningsproces op tijd en correct te laten verlopen
Verbeteren huidige processen: samen met collega’s en experts kijk jij hoe processen slimmer opgezet kunnen worden.




Jouw werkplek

De standplaats van ons hoofdkantoor is Utrecht. Je komt te werken in het team van Operations Strategy & Performance en werk je met verschillende collega’s nauw samen. Je rapporteert aan de Manager Performance & Quality. In ieder geval, waar je ook werkt: we luisteren áltijd naar wat je te zeggen hebt. Hoe meer perspectieven en meningen we horen, hoe beter we daar allemaal van worden. Zo hebben we als organisatie dit jaar de certificaat Great Place to Work gekregen. Deze certificering is 100% gebaseerd op feedback van medewerkers.




Dit ben jij

Dankzij jouw ervaring met projecten weet jij het overzicht te bewaren en denk jij probleemoplossend. Jij weet om te gaan met bulkdata en kun jij deze data vertalen naar bruikbare informatie voor jouw collega’s. Jouw communicatieve vaardigheden zorgen ervoor dat je prettig samenwerkt met diverse collega’s van verschillende teams in de organisatie. Daarnaast ben jij punctueel, kun je onder tijdsdruk werken en houd jij tijdsplanningen en andere doelstellingen scherp in de gaten en stuurt bij waar nodig.




Verder heb jij:

Hbo werk- en denkniveau;
Flexibele houding t.a.v. werktijden en werkdagen – je vindt het niet erg om soms voor 09.00 of na 17.00 te werken;
Affiniteit met HR processen en verloning;
Kennis van wet- en regelgeving betreffende cao beleid is een pre, heb je dit nog niet dan leren wij het je graag;
Uitgebreide Excel vaardigheden.




Dit krijg jij

Een zelfstandige en uitdagende baan in een gedreven team van professionele collega’s met een no-nonsense cultuur. Daarbij:

Een salaris tussen de €3.500 tot maximaal €4.000 o.b.v 40 uur;
Bonusregeling van 5%;
Flexibele werktijden en de mogelijkheid om thuis te werken 32-40 uur;
Standaard 23 vakantiedagen;
Cao à la carte; wij bieden jou de mogelijkheid te kiezen voor 4,5 extra vrije dagen op jaarbasis óf te kiezen voor uitbetaling;
Een goede pensioenregeling;
Opleidings- en trainingsmogelijkheden vanaf dag één;
Mooie doorgroeikansen binnen de organisatie;
De mogelijkheid tot hybride werken.




De toekomst van bezorgen is geel-rood

DHL eCommerce is het meest toonaangevende logistiekbedrijf ter wereld. Dat klinkt misschien opschepperig, maar zo bedoelen we het niet: we zien het namelijk niet als een verdienste, maar als een verantwoordelijkheid. Dankzij onze positie kunnen we het verschil maken voor onze mensen, het milieu en de maatschappij. En dat blijkt: we zijn een Great Place to Work, Top Employer 2025 en helpen via DHL Cares ontzettend veel mensen die dat hard kunnen gebruiken – daar zijn we trots op!

Hybrid, with 2–3 days per week in their London office

I’m working with a mission-driven climate tech startup that’s building the software to help decarbonise the energy grid. Their platform already controls tens of thousands of real-world energy assets, from EVs to heating systems, shifting energy use to times when electricity is clean and cheap.




They're now hiring their first Data Analyst to help make sense of the millions of data points they generate each day, and to surface insights that will guide product, engineering, and commercial decisions.

You’ll work with real-time data from connected energy devices across the UK
You’ll build dashboards and reporting tools used by the whole business
Your work will directly support performance tracking, device monitoring, and strategic decision-making
This is a high-ownership role in a fast-moving, well-funded startup




You’ll work with SQL and Python, and collaborate closely with a small, cross-functional team of engineers, product managers, and energy specialists.

Salary – Competitive




A well-respected Insurer is searching for a Data Business Analyst to join them out of their Manchester office. They are a Specialty Insurance business focusing on international lines of business across property, casualty and cyber to name a few.




The successful candidate will focus on data, reporting and analytics to deliver solutions to the business across various regulatory, tech and operating model changes whilst working closely with their in-house data team.




Key Responsibilities




You must have a very strong background in data, reporting and analytics with experience in database querying via SQL.
You must have a very strong background in data visualisation using Power BI (or a similar tool).
Despite it being a ‘data’ role, the core Business Analyst skills are still very much a requirement, so this must be demonstrated in your CV.
Any experience working with either Specialty Insurance or General Insurance is an obvious plus but is not an absolute requirement.




This is an excellent opportunity to join a brilliant business in an exciting period of growth.

What’s the moment you decided to learn how to work with data?




There’s a lot of different reasons people learn the skills of a Data Analyst. Maybe you came from a business background – with the realisation that there were trends to discover, inefficiencies to identify and decisions that could make a serious difference to the business.




Maybe you started in marketing, and realised you have a great understanding of customer behaviour, what metrics need to be hit and a deep understanding of business operations – and that working with the data would let you translate your knowledge into actions that improve your work further?




Whatever the reasons, data has slowly become a key part of your skillset – and maybe you’re ready to showcase these skills with a new challenge?




I’m currently looking for somebody like you, somebody who can bridge the gap between operational know-how and data driven decision making and is looking to make a big impact in a business. I’m partnered with a fast growing company in Sheffield who have cornered their market niche, and are looking to add a Data Analyst to their team who can unlock the various data streams in their business.




The role is designed for somebody who understands the “why” behind business processes and is excited to use data to make them better. You’ll need a real hunger to dig deeper into the data and think outside the box for innovative ways to improve the business.




The business has a fantastic reputation, giving their staff the autonomy they need to deliver. They’re known for their flexibility, where they give you the opportunity to balance your work around your life, as opposed to balancing your life around your work. They want you in the office twice a month to catch-up with the team, otherwise you’re free to work the way that you feel will allow you to succeed.




Sound interesting? Please get in touch if you’d like to find out more.




Skills / Experience:

Commercial experience with SQL + Python is essential
A good understanding of at least one reporting/visualization tool (Tableau / PowerBI preferred)
A background in Marketing, Analytics, Business or a related field
Degree in a related field preferred, or equivalent (and relevant) experience

Everyone has an idea of what a water company does.

All of which will support the pollution improvement plan, manage reputational risk and help the policy and assurance team in River Health with additional real time reporting.

You will be responsible for administering the Storm Overflow Map, ensuring that monitoring equipment is performing satisfactorily and demonstrating an accurate picture of asset performance. This will include raising remedial work for monitoring equipment or ensuring Waste Operatives address issues.
