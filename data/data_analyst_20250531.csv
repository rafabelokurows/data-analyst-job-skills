PayPal has been revolutionizing commerce globally for more than 25 years. Creating innovative experiences that make moving money, selling, and shopping simple, personalized, and secure, PayPal empowers consumers and businesses in approximately 200 markets to join and thrive in the global economy.

We operate a global, two-sided network at scale that connects hundreds of millions of merchants and consumers. We help merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online or in person. PayPal is more than a connection to third-party payment networks. We provide proprietary payment solutions accepted by merchants that enable the completion of payments on our platform on behalf of our customers.

We offer our customers the flexibility to use their accounts to purchase and receive payments for goods and services, as well as the ability to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to exchange funds more safely with merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, PayPal and Venmo branded credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible credit card rewards. Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts. We also help merchants connect with their customers, process exchanges and returns, and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling cross-border trade.

Our beliefs are the foundation for how we conduct business every day. We live each day guided by our core values of Inclusion, Innovation, Collaboration, and Wellness. Together, our values ensure that we work together as one global team with our customers at the center of everything we do – and they push us to ensure we take care of ourselves, each other, and our communities.

O Observador, com apenas 10 anos de existência, é hoje uma marca incontornável no panorama mediático nacional. De gema exclusivamente digital o Observador foi – e continua a ser – pioneiro na forma de fazer jornalismo e de chegar aos seus leitores. Um jornalismo independente, sem medos e sem agendas político-partidárias. Uma casa livre, plural e democrática na forma como partilha a sua visão da sociedade. O rigor, a curiosidade, a ambição e o foco na diferenciação, enquanto motores de um jornalismo inovador, são valores que fazem parte do ADN dos mais de 150 colaboradores que, atualmente, integram a família Observador.

A posição

Num jornal exclusivamente digital, a orientação estratégica e cultural exige decisões fundamentadas em dados. Por isso, a equipa de Data & Analytics, ainda pequena, procura reforçar-se com a entrada de um(a) Data Analyst que irá reportar diretamente ao Head de Data & Analytics. Esta pessoa será responsável por fazer a ponte entre os vários departamentos internos da empresa – desde a direção, à redação, até à própria equipa de tecnologia onde estará integrada –, quer através de análises ad-hoc, que ajudem a desbloquear ações concretas, quer através de análises mais complexas e estruturadas, que envolvam a automação de processos de recolha de dados, bem como a sua ingestão, integração e modelação, para posterior disponibilização em ferramentas de visualização (dashboards e relatórios) de consulta recorrente. Para além de uma forte componente técnica, que lhe permita implementar e manter os mais variados fluxos de dados, espera-se também um sentido crítico apurado e uma capacidade confortável de storytelling analítico, que traduza os dados em insights claros e acionáveis para a organização.

As Tuas Skills

O que valorizamos no teu perfil técnico:


Experiência com linguagens de gestão de dados como Python ou R.
Conhecimentos de SQL para manipulação e extração de dados a partir de bases de dados relacionais e não relacionais (como MySQL, Oracle DB e Big Query).
Experiência em modelação de dados orientada a relatórios, garantindo a criação de modelos dimensionais (ex: estrela, floco de neve) otimizados para performance e usabilidade em ferramentas como Power BI, Grafana ou Looker Studio.
Facilidade na utilização, manutenção e gestão de ficheiros Excel, CSV, TXT, JSON e XML.
Plus: experiência na extração de dados através de rest APIs e na sua integração automatizada em bases de dados relacionais ou data warehouses, com foco em eficiência e escalabilidade.


O Que Valorizamos Nas Tuas Soft Skills


Pensamento crítico e analítico: capacidade de questionar dados, interpretar padrões e tirar conclusões relevantes para o negócio.
Boa comunicação interpessoal: facilidade em transmitir insights técnicos de forma clara e adaptada a diferentes públicos (equipas técnicas e não técnicas).
Colaboração interdepartamental: habilidade para trabalhar em conjunto com equipas de produto, marketing, vendas, etc., compreendendo as suas necessidades e objetivos.
Proatividade na resolução de problemas: atitude ativa na identificação de oportunidades de melhoria e formulação de soluções baseadas em dados.
Abertura ao feedback: recetividade a críticas construtivas, com vontade de melhorar continuamente processos, análises e entregáveis.
Gestão de prioridades: capacidade de lidar com múltiplas solicitações e ajustar o foco com base nas necessidades do negócio.
Orientação para o detalhe: atenção aos pormenores na análise e apresentação dos dados, garantindo precisão e confiança.
Capacidade de storytelling com dados: traduzir dados complexos em narrativas claras que apoiem a tomada de decisão.
