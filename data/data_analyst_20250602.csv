O Observador, com apenas 10 anos de existência, é hoje uma marca incontornável no panorama mediático nacional. De gema exclusivamente digital o Observador foi – e continua a ser – pioneiro na forma de fazer jornalismo e de chegar aos seus leitores. Um jornalismo independente, sem medos e sem agendas político-partidárias. Uma casa livre, plural e democrática na forma como partilha a sua visão da sociedade. O rigor, a curiosidade, a ambição e o foco na diferenciação, enquanto motores de um jornalismo inovador, são valores que fazem parte do ADN dos mais de 150 colaboradores que, atualmente, integram a família Observador.

A posição

Num jornal exclusivamente digital, a orientação estratégica e cultural exige decisões fundamentadas em dados. Por isso, a equipa de Data & Analytics, ainda pequena, procura reforçar-se com a entrada de um(a) Data Analyst que irá reportar diretamente ao Head de Data & Analytics. Esta pessoa será responsável por fazer a ponte entre os vários departamentos internos da empresa – desde a direção, à redação, até à própria equipa de tecnologia onde estará integrada –, quer através de análises ad-hoc, que ajudem a desbloquear ações concretas, quer através de análises mais complexas e estruturadas, que envolvam a automação de processos de recolha de dados, bem como a sua ingestão, integração e modelação, para posterior disponibilização em ferramentas de visualização (dashboards e relatórios) de consulta recorrente. Para além de uma forte componente técnica, que lhe permita implementar e manter os mais variados fluxos de dados, espera-se também um sentido crítico apurado e uma capacidade confortável de storytelling analítico, que traduza os dados em insights claros e acionáveis para a organização.

As Tuas Skills

O que valorizamos no teu perfil técnico:


Experiência com linguagens de gestão de dados como Python ou R.
Conhecimentos de SQL para manipulação e extração de dados a partir de bases de dados relacionais e não relacionais (como MySQL, Oracle DB e Big Query).
Experiência em modelação de dados orientada a relatórios, garantindo a criação de modelos dimensionais (ex: estrela, floco de neve) otimizados para performance e usabilidade em ferramentas como Power BI, Grafana ou Looker Studio.
Facilidade na utilização, manutenção e gestão de ficheiros Excel, CSV, TXT, JSON e XML.
Plus: experiência na extração de dados através de rest APIs e na sua integração automatizada em bases de dados relacionais ou data warehouses, com foco em eficiência e escalabilidade.


O Que Valorizamos Nas Tuas Soft Skills


Pensamento crítico e analítico: capacidade de questionar dados, interpretar padrões e tirar conclusões relevantes para o negócio.
Boa comunicação interpessoal: facilidade em transmitir insights técnicos de forma clara e adaptada a diferentes públicos (equipas técnicas e não técnicas).
Colaboração interdepartamental: habilidade para trabalhar em conjunto com equipas de produto, marketing, vendas, etc., compreendendo as suas necessidades e objetivos.
Proatividade na resolução de problemas: atitude ativa na identificação de oportunidades de melhoria e formulação de soluções baseadas em dados.
Abertura ao feedback: recetividade a críticas construtivas, com vontade de melhorar continuamente processos, análises e entregáveis.
Gestão de prioridades: capacidade de lidar com múltiplas solicitações e ajustar o foco com base nas necessidades do negócio.
Orientação para o detalhe: atenção aos pormenores na análise e apresentação dos dados, garantindo precisão e confiança.
Capacidade de storytelling com dados: traduzir dados complexos em narrativas claras que apoiem a tomada de decisão.

Lumafield was founded in 2019 to upgrade manufacturing.




We are engineers with deep experience across the product development cycle, from initial ideas to shipping hardware, across industries and specializations, who became frustrated by the cost and complexity of modern manufacturing. So we decided to upgrade it.




Engineers make million-dollar decisions every day, and they need tools that give them the greatest possible insight into their products. By offering unprecedented visibility into products, as well as AI-driven tools that highlight problems and generate quantitative data, Lumafield promises to revolutionize the way complex products are created, manufactured, and used across industries. We started with industrial CT scanning, which for us was the most valuable but underutilized tool in the manufacturing toolbox, enabling us to rapidly inspect essential components non-destructively.




We rebuilt the whole system, from X-ray capture, to computer vision analysis, to web-based collaboration, to the entire business model, making the most advanced manufacturing tech more accessible to every industry. Our company, like our platform, is designed for upgrades. We’re building for greater intelligence, autonomy, and speed. For deeper vision, operational excellence, and powerful insights. And then we'll upgrade it all again.




Lumafield is headquartered in Cambridge, MA, and has an office in San Francisco, CA.




About the role:




The ideal candidate for this role comes from a Data Science background with startup experience working with systems. If you thrive on solving big business problems, love connecting the dots between technology and strategy, and want to see your ideas come to life across the entire organization, this is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. This role will be focused on providing critical insights to the business, as well as building and maintaining the required business systems, workflows, processes, and connections necessary to get those analyses up and running. As such, the role will require being comfortable handling a “full stack” of tasks at a high level, ranging from systems implementation, translating process requirements into systems requirements and vice versa, data engineering, and data analysis.




This role puts you at the heart of our company’s evolution, giving you the opportunity to shape how we work, make data-driven decisions, and deliver exceptional value to our customers and teams.




What you'll do:
Partner with leaders and teams across the business to uncover high-impact opportunities, translating real business needs into innovative system and data solutions that drive company growth and operational excellence
Improve or build new capabilities in existing business systems and hand off to system owners throughout the company
Champion process optimization by identifying and implementing both technology-driven and strategic improvements, ensuring our business stays agile and competitive
Maintain a stack of business systems and build integrations and connections between them as needed
Define and document these processes and workflows in process diagrams, wireframes, mapping documents, functional specifications, non-functional specifications, ERDs, use cases, user stories, and logical data models
Serve as a trusted advisor and trainer, equipping end users and stakeholders with the knowledge and tools they need to maximize the impact of our systems and insights
Project manage external systems consultants, where necessary




About you:
5-10 years of work experience in data analysis, business intelligence, and business systems
Strong SQL and proficient Python knowledge
Experience with data warehouse technical architectures, infrastructure components, ETL/ ELT and reporting/analytic tools
Experience in API integrations and data migration/data conversion.
Experience with data visualization tools and packages (e.g. Looker, Tableau, Power BI)
Experience implementing business systems, sometimes from scratch (including understanding business processes, gathering user requirements, design, testing, deployment, and training)
Must have the ability to communicate, motivate and organize projects throughout the company
Must have ability to work independently and handle end-to-end projects







Lumafield offers both competitive cash and equity compensation, as well as a health & wellness stipend, 401k, parental leave, flexible PTO, commuter benefits, company wide events and more! 




Lumafield is committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, because the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be. Do you feel like your skills don’t meet every single requirement listed? We encourage you to apply anyway – If you’re excited about our technology, the opportunity, and are eager to learn more we’d love to hear from you!  




In keeping with our beliefs and goals, no employee or applicant will face discrimination or harassment based on: race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, genetic information or veteran status. 




Reach out if you want to be a part of what we are building.

Lumafield was founded in 2019 to upgrade manufacturing.




We are engineers with deep experience across the product development cycle, from initial ideas to shipping hardware, across industries and specializations, who became frustrated by the cost and complexity of modern manufacturing. So we decided to upgrade it.




Engineers make million-dollar decisions every day, and they need tools that give them the greatest possible insight into their products. By offering unprecedented visibility into products, as well as AI-driven tools that highlight problems and generate quantitative data, Lumafield promises to revolutionize the way complex products are created, manufactured, and used across industries. We started with industrial CT scanning, which for us was the most valuable but underutilized tool in the manufacturing toolbox, enabling us to rapidly inspect essential components non-destructively.




We rebuilt the whole system, from X-ray capture, to computer vision analysis, to web-based collaboration, to the entire business model, making the most advanced manufacturing tech more accessible to every industry. Our company, like our platform, is designed for upgrades. We’re building for greater intelligence, autonomy, and speed. For deeper vision, operational excellence, and powerful insights. And then we'll upgrade it all again.




Lumafield is headquartered in Cambridge, MA, and has an office in San Francisco, CA.




About the role:




The ideal candidate for this role comes from a Data Science background with startup experience working with systems. If you thrive on solving big business problems, love connecting the dots between technology and strategy, and want to see your ideas come to life across the entire organization, this is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. This role will be focused on providing critical insights to the business, as well as building and maintaining the required business systems, workflows, processes, and connections necessary to get those analyses up and running. As such, the role will require being comfortable handling a “full stack” of tasks at a high level, ranging from systems implementation, translating process requirements into systems requirements and vice versa, data engineering, and data analysis.




This role puts you at the heart of our company’s evolution, giving you the opportunity to shape how we work, make data-driven decisions, and deliver exceptional value to our customers and teams.




What you'll do:
Partner with leaders and teams across the business to uncover high-impact opportunities, translating real business needs into innovative system and data solutions that drive company growth and operational excellence
Improve or build new capabilities in existing business systems and hand off to system owners throughout the company
Champion process optimization by identifying and implementing both technology-driven and strategic improvements, ensuring our business stays agile and competitive
Maintain a stack of business systems and build integrations and connections between them as needed
Define and document these processes and workflows in process diagrams, wireframes, mapping documents, functional specifications, non-functional specifications, ERDs, use cases, user stories, and logical data models
Serve as a trusted advisor and trainer, equipping end users and stakeholders with the knowledge and tools they need to maximize the impact of our systems and insights
Project manage external systems consultants, where necessary




About you:
5-10 years of work experience in data analysis, business intelligence, and business systems
Strong SQL and proficient Python knowledge
Experience with data warehouse technical architectures, infrastructure components, ETL/ ELT and reporting/analytic tools
Experience in API integrations and data migration/data conversion.
Experience with data visualization tools and packages (e.g. Looker, Tableau, Power BI)
Experience implementing business systems, sometimes from scratch (including understanding business processes, gathering user requirements, design, testing, deployment, and training)
Must have the ability to communicate, motivate and organize projects throughout the company
Must have ability to work independently and handle end-to-end projects







Lumafield offers both competitive cash and equity compensation, as well as a health & wellness stipend, 401k, parental leave, flexible PTO, commuter benefits, company wide events and more! 




Lumafield is committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, because the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be. Do you feel like your skills don’t meet every single requirement listed? We encourage you to apply anyway – If you’re excited about our technology, the opportunity, and are eager to learn more we’d love to hear from you!  




In keeping with our beliefs and goals, no employee or applicant will face discrimination or harassment based on: race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, genetic information or veteran status. 




Reach out if you want to be a part of what we are building.
