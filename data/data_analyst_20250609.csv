O Observador, com apenas 10 anos de existência, é hoje uma marca incontornável no panorama mediático nacional. De gema exclusivamente digital o Observador foi – e continua a ser – pioneiro na forma de fazer jornalismo e de chegar aos seus leitores. Um jornalismo independente, sem medos e sem agendas político-partidárias. Uma casa livre, plural e democrática na forma como partilha a sua visão da sociedade. O rigor, a curiosidade, a ambição e o foco na diferenciação, enquanto motores de um jornalismo inovador, são valores que fazem parte do ADN dos mais de 150 colaboradores que, atualmente, integram a família Observador.

A posição

Num jornal exclusivamente digital, a orientação estratégica e cultural exige decisões fundamentadas em dados. Por isso, a equipa de Data & Analytics, ainda pequena, procura reforçar-se com a entrada de um(a) Data Analyst que irá reportar diretamente ao Head de Data & Analytics. Esta pessoa será responsável por fazer a ponte entre os vários departamentos internos da empresa – desde a direção, à redação, até à própria equipa de tecnologia onde estará integrada –, quer através de análises ad-hoc, que ajudem a desbloquear ações concretas, quer através de análises mais complexas e estruturadas, que envolvam a automação de processos de recolha de dados, bem como a sua ingestão, integração e modelação, para posterior disponibilização em ferramentas de visualização (dashboards e relatórios) de consulta recorrente. Para além de uma forte componente técnica, que lhe permita implementar e manter os mais variados fluxos de dados, espera-se também um sentido crítico apurado e uma capacidade confortável de storytelling analítico, que traduza os dados em insights claros e acionáveis para a organização.

As Tuas Skills

O que valorizamos no teu perfil técnico:


Experiência com linguagens de gestão de dados como Python ou R.
Conhecimentos de SQL para manipulação e extração de dados a partir de bases de dados relacionais e não relacionais (como MySQL, Oracle DB e Big Query).
Experiência em modelação de dados orientada a relatórios, garantindo a criação de modelos dimensionais (ex: estrela, floco de neve) otimizados para performance e usabilidade em ferramentas como Power BI, Grafana ou Looker Studio.
Facilidade na utilização, manutenção e gestão de ficheiros Excel, CSV, TXT, JSON e XML.
Plus: experiência na extração de dados através de rest APIs e na sua integração automatizada em bases de dados relacionais ou data warehouses, com foco em eficiência e escalabilidade.


O Que Valorizamos Nas Tuas Soft Skills


Pensamento crítico e analítico: capacidade de questionar dados, interpretar padrões e tirar conclusões relevantes para o negócio.
Boa comunicação interpessoal: facilidade em transmitir insights técnicos de forma clara e adaptada a diferentes públicos (equipas técnicas e não técnicas).
Colaboração interdepartamental: habilidade para trabalhar em conjunto com equipas de produto, marketing, vendas, etc., compreendendo as suas necessidades e objetivos.
Proatividade na resolução de problemas: atitude ativa na identificação de oportunidades de melhoria e formulação de soluções baseadas em dados.
Abertura ao feedback: recetividade a críticas construtivas, com vontade de melhorar continuamente processos, análises e entregáveis.
Gestão de prioridades: capacidade de lidar com múltiplas solicitações e ajustar o foco com base nas necessidades do negócio.
Orientação para o detalhe: atenção aos pormenores na análise e apresentação dos dados, garantindo precisão e confiança.
Capacidade de storytelling com dados: traduzir dados complexos em narrativas claras que apoiem a tomada de decisão.
