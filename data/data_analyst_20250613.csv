This role is ideal for someone who enjoys rolling up their sleeves, make sense out of unstructured data and build systems that make others more effective.

You'll be the connective tissue between our data, tools, and people—turning raw data into practical insights that enhance portfolio tracking, deal sourcing, and internal decision-making. You'll also help shape our internal data workflows, tooling stack, and light BI infrastructure.

We're not building complex machine learning models, but we are building thoughtful, reliable internal data systems - and we'd love your help.

What You'll Do

Portfolio Data & BI Foundations


Structure and manage key internal datasets related to portfolio performance, financials, and operational KPIs
Build dashboards and reports that help us track what matters across companies, sectors, and time
Benchmark portfolio metrics against market data (via tools like Affinity, Standard Metrics, or others)
Help evaluate, implement, and improve data tooling (Snowflake, Looker, Sigma, Affinity integrations, etc.)
Act as the internal owner for our data flows—identify gaps, fix breakages, and communicate clearly with stakeholders.


Lightweight External Analysis


Support research efforts on sectors, markets, and emerging technologies - e.g., tracking valuations or sector trends over time
Assist with ad hoc projects using external datasets (Crunchbase, PitchBook, etc.)
Prepare simple, clear visualizations and summaries for internal decks or LP updates.


Who We're Looking For

This role is not for someone seeking cutting-edge ML work or a highly structured corporate analytics team. Instead, you should be someone who:


Has 1-3 years of relevant experience in data analytics, business intelligence, or adjacent roles (startups, ops, FP&A, venture platform, research, or consulting)
Is comfortable working solo on data problems, but knows when to ask questions or bring in help
Can, outside of analyzing data, build a story around it, including using visualization tools to make data insightful and accessible
Has solid experience with Excel and ideally BI tools (Looker, Tableau, Sigma, etc.). Bonus: familiarity with Python, SQL or light scripting
Has a strong sense of internal ""product ownership""—you care about whether people actually use what you build
Is curious, pragmatic, and good at simplifying—not over-engineering
Can be trusted to interface with both junior and senior stakeholders, and explain technical things clearly
May not have VC experience (that's okay!), but is interested in startups, tech, or long-term investing.


Why This Role Might Be a Fit


You like simple, clear data and value clean dashboards over endless dashboards
You want a role with impact, ownership, and stability
You might have worked at a startup or small team, where you wore multiple hats and had to figure things out yourself
You want to own something end-to-end—from sourcing data to seeing decisions being made with it
You're a builder, you're happy to fix a bug, standardize a field name, or push a Slack update if it helps someone else
You want to work with one of the best team in Venture!



Benefits


25-day holidays
Generous parental leave
Private health insurance
Several off-sites with the team each year
Wellness budget
