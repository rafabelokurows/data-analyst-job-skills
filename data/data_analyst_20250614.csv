Company Background
Great Gray is the leading independent provider of trustee and administrative services to Collective Investment Trusts (“CITs”), with over $200 billion in CIT assets under management, across more than 780 funds. We proudly work with 80 subadvisors, including leading firms such as AllianceBernstein, American Funds, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, MetLife, Neuberger Berman, PGIM, PIMCO and Raymond James.

CITs are more than just an investment vehicle. They represent a forward-thinking approach to retirement planning. These tax-exempt, pooled investment vehicles are offered to employer-sponsored retirement plans, like 401(k)s. CITs are comparable to mutual funds, but, because they are tailored for the institutional retirement market, they can offer distinct advantages, including efficient administration and cost-effectiveness. CITs have a history dating back over 90 years; but they have gained favor over the past decade, driven by innovations, and Great Gray has been at the forefront.

Great Gray has consistently delivered year-over-year growth at an above market rate and is investing in the continued development of its core CIT business as well as complementary administrative services and technology solutions for the retirement market.

Madison Dearborn Partners (“MDP”) purchased Great Gray from Wilmington Trust in April 2023. As a result, Great Gray is an independent company owned by funds affiliated with MDP.

Investor Background

MDP is a leading private equity investment firm based in Chicago. Since MDP's formation in 1992, the firm has raised aggregate capital of over $28 billion and has completed over 150 platform investments. MDP invests across five dedicated industry verticals, including basic industries; business and government software and services; financial and transaction services; health care; and telecom, media, and technology services.
