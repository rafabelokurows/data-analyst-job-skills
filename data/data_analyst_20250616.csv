About WebPros

WebPros is committed to empowering businesses worldwide through cutting-edge solutions in web hosting, billing automation, infrastructure, server management, and online marketing. Since our founding in 2017, we’ve rapidly grown into a global leader, expanding our robust portfolio to include industry-defining brands such as cPanel & WHM, Plesk, WHMCS, SolusVM, NIXStats, XOVI, SocialBee, and Sitejet.

Today, we power 85 million+ websites across 900,000+ servers worldwide, backed by a 600+ strong team of dedicated professionals spanning multiple continents. At WebPros, we embrace a fully remote, borderless workplace with a focus on flexibility, autonomy, and work-life balance. Whether you prefer working from a bustling city hub or a quiet home office, we enable our teams to thrive from anywhere while staying deeply connected through our strong collaborative culture.

Your Role

Hi, I’m Bartek, Director SEO & Social Media Marketing Product Portfolio here at WebPros and your future manager. I started my journey by founding a digital agency in my early twenties, which led me into the world of product strategy, growth, and analytics. Over the past 15 years, I’ve helped scale SaaS products to hundreds of thousands of users, led teams across product, development, and marketing, and contributed to building a structured, data-informed culture across WebPros. Today, I focus on driving product success through measurable insights, strong execution, and scalable frameworks—and I’m looking for someone who’s excited to do the same.

We’re now hiring a Product Analyst to help us level up our product analytics and tracking across our global portfolio. This role is all about connecting the dots—from user behavior to product impact—and enabling our teams to make better decisions, faster. You’ll work across four product streams (both SaaS and on-premise), supporting ~20 product managers and collaborating with engineering and data teams. You’ll play a key role in defining meaningful product metrics, helping PMs ask the right questions, and guiding engineers on how to implement clean, actionable tracking.

The biggest challenge in this role? Building a full, end-to-end picture of user activity tracking. That means navigating legal/privacy boundaries, working closely with engineering to ensure quality data flows into Mixpanel and our data warehouse (BigQuery, Redshift, PostgreSQL), and educating PMs on how to choose the right metrics and interpret results. It’s a hands-on role, and we’ll look to you as the go-to expert for product analytics tools like Mixpanel, SQL, and Looker Studio.

You’ll thrive here if you’re comfortable educating others, writing your own queries, structuring metrics from scratch, and collaborating across functions to turn ambiguity into clarity. If you’re the kind of person who gets excited about fixing messy data, documenting tracking plans, and influencing product direction through insight—you’ll fit right in.

You might struggle here if you’re looking for a narrowly scoped analyst role with mature processes already in place. We’re still building the playbook—and you’ll be helping to shape it.

As part of a small and growing product analytics team, you’ll work across ~20 product managers and 4 product streams. While the data engineering team handles broader data ingestion, you’ll sit at the intersection of product and insight—bringing user behavior to the surface so our teams can act on it. And as part of WebPros’ broader product organization, you’ll contribute to shaping how analytics scales across our brands.

This is a hands-on, high-impact role where your ability to translate data into action will directly influence our product direction and customer experience.

Below, you’ll find everything you need to decide if this role is right for you. From our culture and work style to the specifics of the position and hiring process. We believe in transparency, so we’ve put in the effort to give you a real, inside look at what it’s like to work here.

Your Impact In The First 180 Days

We don’t believe in endless checklists of requirements. Instead, here’s what success looks like in your first 6 months:


30 Days: Familiarize yourself with our full product portfolio, from SaaS to on-premise tools. Understand the structure of our four product streams and begin building relationships with product managers, engineers, and data stakeholders. Review and update tracking requirements documentation and assume ownership of Mixpanel communication and implementation support.
60 Days: Take ownership of core product metrics for your assigned product stream(s). Establish tracking processes with product and engineering teams, guide event implementation, and support engineers in implementing tracking specs correctly. Deliver your first post-launch analysis and help PMs identify actionable product insights.
120 Days: Lead in closing key gaps by coaching engineers on clean data implementation and supporting PMs in identifying meaningful metrics and creating data stories. Run end-to-end behavioral analysis for features across multiple product lines. Begin building strategic partnerships with the Data Engineering team to enhance user activity data with broader data lake metrics.
180 Days: Establish yourself as a trusted advisor across multiple product streams. Drive improvements in analytics processes and data documentation, and proactively contribute to team-wide best practices. Influence roadmap decisions, help shape how success is measured across product lines, and start educating PMs and engineers to improve analytics maturity across the product org.


As you grow in this role, you’ll have the opportunity to expand your impact across all four product streams—mentoring others, contributing to analytics tooling decisions, and driving standardization across our tracking and reporting ecosystem.

You’ll Thrive Here If You


You enjoy helping others level up — from defining tracking strategies to coaching others on interpreting data.
Are confident working across multiple product streams, collaborating with 20+ PMs and diverse engineering teams.
Have strong hands-on experience with Mixpanel, including maintaining lexicons, validating implementation, and driving tracking consistency.
Can work end-to-end—from metric definition and SQL-based analysis to visualization in Looker Studio and strategic recommendation.
Are comfortable coaching teams on both the technical (data hygiene) and strategic (product metrics) aspects of analytics.
Communicate clearly in writing and asynchronously across stakeholders in product, engineering, and data.
Thrive in complex environments and enjoy creating clarity out of ambiguity.


You Might Struggle Here If You


Prefer to work on a single product or within a narrowly defined scope.
Need top-down instruction for daily tasks or find it hard to prioritize without a detailed playbook.
Avoid working across legal, engineering, and product to solve messy data problems collaboratively.
Expect clean and centralized data to always be available—some digging and reconciliation is required.
Aren’t comfortable with technical tools like SQL, Redshift, BigQuery, or Mixpanel, or need significant support to operate independently.
Struggle to educate and coach others on the “why” and “how” of good analytics practices.


How We Work


Team & Collaboration: Remote-first and async-friendly setup, embedded within the product org and working closely with Product Managers, Engineers, and the Data team across four product streams.
Team Structure: You’ll be 1 of 3 Product Analysts supporting ~20 Product Managers, working cross-functionally across four product streams with dedicated product and engineering teams.
Communication & Meetings: Clear, structured documentation using Confluence and O365; async-first communication via Slack; minimal, focused meetings held via Teams.
Tooling & Stack: Daily use of SQL, Python, Mixpanel, Google ETL, BigQuery, Redshift, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Looker Studio, and Google Sheets.
Collaboration & Documentation: Jira for planning and tracking; Confluence and Looker dashboards for transparent documentation and sharing of analytical outputs.
Ownership & Autonomy: Analysts own the full workflow — from defining metrics and data requirements to conducting analysis and presenting actionable insights.
Rituals & Process: Weekly team syncs and regular squad rituals ensure alignment, adaptability, and a continuous feedback loop between data and product direction.

Your Hiring Experience

Hi, I’m Florian, your Talent Partner for EMEA at WebPros. I’ll guide you through the interview process, ensuring a clear, transparent, and meaningful experience. Before moving into talent and culture, I was a software engineer, so I understand what it’s like to navigate technical hiring. My goal is to make this process a genuine, two-way conversation where you feel informed, valued, and empowered to make the best decision for your career.

Hiring is about relationships, not just resumes. You can expect honest, constructive feedback at every step, and I welcome yours as well. No matter the outcome, I want this to be a positive and insightful experience. If you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn.

Interview Process


Screening Interview (30-45 min): An informal conversation with Florian (Talent Partner) to get to know each other. We’ll explore your background, motivation, and aspirations while giving you a clear overview of WebPros, the team setup, and what to expect from the process. This is your opportunity to ask questions and make sure the role aligns with your career goals.
Hiring Manager Interview (45-60 min): A focused conversation with Bartek (Hiring Manager) to dive deeper into how you approach product analytics, collaboration, ownership, and navigating ambiguity. We’ll also align on your past experience, expectations, and ways of working to assess fit with the team and product area.
Technical & Product Case Interview (60 min): A working session with Bartek and two team members from Product and Data. Together, you’ll walk through a product analytics case, working with a real or hypothetical scenario. This step is designed to evaluate how you break down product questions, work with data, identify insights, and communicate recommendations. We’ll also look at your collaboration style, product intuition, and ability to adapt to imperfect or evolving data environments.
Offer Talk (30 min): A final conversation with Bartek and Florian to walk through the offer, discuss any remaining questions, and ensure mutual clarity on expectations and next steps.

Discrimination of any kind, including sexism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and ageism, has no place here. By embracing differences and championing inclusivity, we create an environment where everyone can thrive.

We are looking forward to your application!

Best,

Bartek & Florian

Since our founding in 2017, we’ve rapidly grown into a global leader, expanding our robust portfolio to include industry-defining brands such as cPanel &amp; WHM, Plesk, WHMCS, SolusVM, NIXStats, XOVI, SocialBee, and Sitejet.<br><br>Today, we power <strong>85 million+ websites</strong> across <strong>900,000+ servers worldwide</strong>, backed by a <strong>600+ strong team</strong> of dedicated professionals spanning multiple continents. At WebPros, we embrace a fully remote, borderless workplace with a focus on flexibility, autonomy, and work-life balance. Whether you prefer working from a bustling city hub or a quiet home office, we enable our teams to thrive from anywhere while staying deeply connected through our strong collaborative culture.<br><br>Your Role<br><br><strong>Hi, I’m Bartek, Director SEO &amp; Social Media Marketing Product Portfolio here at WebPros and your future manager.</strong> I started my journey by founding a digital agency in my early twenties, which led me into the world of product strategy, growth, and analytics. Over the past 15 years, I’ve helped scale SaaS products to hundreds of thousands of users, led teams across product, development, and marketing, and contributed to building a structured, data-informed culture across WebPros. Today, I focus on driving product success through measurable insights, strong execution, and scalable frameworks—and I’m looking for someone who’s excited to do the same.<br><br>We’re now hiring a <strong>Product Analyst</strong> to help us level up our product analytics and tracking across our global portfolio. This role is all about connecting the dots—from user behavior to product impact—and enabling our teams to make better decisions, faster. You’ll work across four product streams (both SaaS and on-premise), supporting ~20 product managers and collaborating with engineering and data teams. You’ll play a key role in defining meaningful product metrics, helping PMs ask the right questions, and guiding engineers on how to implement clean, actionable tracking.<br><br><strong>The biggest challenge in this role?</strong> Building a full, end-to-end picture of user activity tracking. That means navigating legal/privacy boundaries, working closely with engineering to ensure quality data flows into Mixpanel and our data warehouse (BigQuery, Redshift, PostgreSQL), and educating PMs on how to choose the right metrics and interpret results. It’s a hands-on role, and we’ll look to you as the go-to expert for product analytics tools like Mixpanel, SQL, and Looker Studio.<br><br><strong>You’ll thrive here if</strong> you’re comfortable educating others, writing your own queries, structuring metrics from scratch, and collaborating across functions to turn ambiguity into clarity. If you’re the kind of person who gets excited about fixing messy data, documenting tracking plans, and influencing product direction through insight—you’ll fit right in.<br><br><strong>You might struggle here if</strong> you’re looking for a narrowly scoped analyst role with mature processes already in place. We’re still building the playbook—and you’ll be helping to shape it.<br><br>As part of a small and growing product analytics team, you’ll work across ~20 product managers and 4 product streams. While the data engineering team handles broader data ingestion, you’ll sit at the intersection of product and insight—bringing user behavior to the surface so our teams can act on it. And as part of WebPros’ broader product organization, you’ll contribute to shaping how analytics scales across our brands.<br><br>This is a hands-on, high-impact role where your ability to translate data into action will directly influence our product direction and customer experience.<br><br><em>Below, you’ll find everything you need to decide if this role is right for you.
