True team player as teamwork is at the heart of everything we do, within a strong feedback culture
Fluency in French and English




In addition to solid technical knowledge and experience, we are looking for passionate individuals with a well-rounded personality and a good sense of humour: we don’t compromise on these.

The diversity of our talents is what makes our work environment multicultural, innovative and highly rewarding.

About the Role:

For our Global Headquarters, we are looking for Business Intelligence Specialist to join our Trade Marketing department in the Travel Market business unit.

Main Responsibilities:

Thanks to your ability to manage and improve data systems, you will oversee the sell-out database and contribute to its continuous evolution. You will work on enhancing current reporting tools and developing new ones, making sure they respond to the specific needs of the business unit. Your role includes adapting existing reports and integrating additional key data, allowing for a more complete and actionable view of the market and internal performance.

You will play a consistent role in providing insights and identifying key trends to support business decisions. This includes developing and maintaining dashboards, mainly using Power BI, that monitor company figures, key performance indicators, market share, and passenger traffic. You will also assist in the selection of appropriate tools for various departments, helping them align their operational needs with the available data solutions.

Your contributions will extend to preparing regular newsletters and ad hoc reports that highlight key findings and support business planning. In parallel, you will be involved in revenue management by analyzing promo return on investment and helping define promotional guidelines in collaboration with the team.

Who we are looking for:

Thanks to your academic background in management, engineering, or statistics, you bring a solid foundation for understanding both technical and business dynamics. With 2 to 4 years of experience in Trade Marketing or Business Intelligence roles, you’re already familiar with the environment and tools that support commercial strategy and data-driven decision-making.

You will rely on your analytical mindset, conceptual thinking, and problem-solving approach to interpret complex information and generate practical insights. Your ability to manage several priorities at once, while adapting to shifting needs, will help you stay effective in a dynamic setting. Clear and structured communication—both written and spoken—will support your contributions within cross-functional project teams.

Your daily work will involve advanced use of Excel and Power BI, and your familiarity with SQL will be a valuable addition. Fluency in English will allow you to collaborate across teams and regions, while any additional language skills will be appreciated as an extra asset.

Are you ready for this great challenge? Don’t miss the chance to apply!

How to be successful in the role and at Ferrero:

SFEIR, c'est avant tout une communauté de 900 techs en France, en Belgique et au Luxembourg. 

 

Nous aidons nos clients à :

 

🔹 Être compatible avec le futur en développant leurs architectures SI, Cloud et Data ;

🔹 Donner de la valeur à leurs données, innover avec l'IA ;

🔹 Créer de la valeur grâce aux API & microservices;

🔹 Développer des applications web et mobiles pour améliorer leur expérience client et se connecter partout.

 

Notre culture d'entreprise est résolument tournée vers l'expertise technologique, la transmission de connaissances et le respect de nos valeurs phares : bienveillance, inclusivité, excellence, liberté, responsabilité. 

 

Et Luxembourg dans tout ça ? 

 

SFEIR Luxembourg c'est : 

 

🔹 Une centaine de développeur.euse.s qui se connaissent toutes et tous ;

🔹 Directeur Engineering qui est aussi consultant @Guillaume ;

🔹 Une vingtaine de clients actifs en local et une centaine au niveau du groupe ;

🔹 Des événements en interne et externes organisés chaque mois (afterworks, webinars, meetup, formations) ;

🔹 Une communauté active : une cinquantaine de conférences externes données en 2024 (Voxxed Days, DevFest, Devoxx, communauté JS, …) ;

🔹 Des locaux situés à 2 pas de la gare centrale ;

 

 

💪  Ce qui fait notre force ?

 

🔹 Achieve greatness - Notre culture est digital native. 

 

L’agilité est au cœur de notre fonctionnement. On s’est inspirés des pratiques des entreprises Digital Natives pour construire notre succès : agilité, rapidité dans les prises de décision, organisation décentralisée, promotion et utilisation de l’Open Source, etc.

 

🔹 Proud to be developers - Notre stratégie est co-construite, par les Techs pour les Techs.

 

La direction générale et la direction de chaque agence sont co-leadées par 2 Managing Directors : Business et Engineering

 

Individuellement, chaque développeur et développeuse reporte à un Engineering Manager. Ce dernier est lui-même développeur et a du temps dédié pour manager. Il travaille étroitement avec le Business pour proposer les missions les plus adaptées à chacun.

 

🔹 Learn & Share - Notre communauté est apprenante et dans le partage.

 

Nous sommes partenaires officiels de Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft, Confluent, MongoDB, Linux Foundation, GitLab, SaFe, Snowflake, Looker, entre autres.

 

On a nos propres dispositifs de formation (SFEIR Institute, SFEIR Schools, …). Ça nous permet de former officiellement nos clients et nos devs.

 

Nous sommes présents à de nombreux évènements Techs au niveau national et régional : tu as sûrement croisé des Sfeirians si tu vas aux Meetups, aux DevFest ou aux Hackathons (Health et Industry Camp).

 

🔹 Notre propre plateforme de LLMs

 

L’opportunité de travailler au plus près de l’IA avec l’utilisation de RAISE, notre propre plateforme d’IA générative. En interne, on a accès à une plateforme (totalement construite sur mesure par nos devs) qui nous permet d'utiliser tous les derniers LLMs disponibles : GPT, Gemini, Mixtral, Claude, etc.

 

 

👩‍💻 👨‍💻 Qui sont les Sfeirians ? 

 

100% des développeur.euse.s sont des techs passionné.e.s par leur métier.

 

Ce qui nous rassemble aussi, c’est notre envie de contribuer à la communauté et à l’entreprise.

 

On a une hiérarchie très plate : on croit que l’entreprise est plus performante quand elle favorise l’autonomie et l’intelligence collective.

 

Tu t’attendais à ce qu’on te parle d’études, de diplômes ou d’expérience, dans cette section ? Chez SFEIR, on n’a qu’un seul critère : c’est ton niveau technique et ta culture tech. On en reparle un peu plus bas !

 

 

🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️ Concrètement, quel sera mon job ? 

 

On travaille avec une trentaine de clients. Ce sont des grandes entreprises du monde de la banque, assurance, industrie ou des startups/scaleups.

 

En mission pour l’un d’entre eux ou sur notre Factory, sur des stacks récentes, tu conçois et développes des solutions pour répondre aux enjeux data.

 

Au-delà de ta maîtrise de Python ou Scala et de l'écosystème Data (ex : Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, …) tu as une curiosité insatiable et tu es dans le partage !

 

@Julien Maujol, @Clément Huaux, et @Justine Lelong, nos super Account Managers, seront à ton écoute pour définir avec toi le projet idéal et tu pourras en changer lorsque tu en auras fait le tour.

 

 

🚀 Et si je souhaite évoluer ? 

 

On se doute que tu veux te développer. Et on a réfléchi à ce qui pourrait te plaire.

Une fois que tu as fait le tour de ton poste, voilà différents rôles que tu pourrais prendre chez SFEIR (mais ce n'est pas une obligation) : 

 

🔹 Si tu veux rester 100% Tech : les Staff Engineer sont des référents techniques dans leur domaine et consacrent entre 1 et 4 jours par semaine à la communauté, en diffusant du savoir technique : formations, conseil aux managers, réponse aux appels d’offres avec l’équipe commerciale, …

 

🔹 Si tu veux t’orienter vers du Management : Les Engineering Managers sont les référents des Développeurs en mission. Tu serais leur coach pour les aider à se sentir bien dans leur job, les faire grandir et suivre leur carrière.

 

Tu auras également la possibilité de prendre des casquettes supplémentaires en interne si tu le souhaites : 

 

🔹 Tech Recruiter dans le processus de recrutement ;

🔹 Trainer aux SFEIR Schools ou au SFEIR Institute ;

🔹 Speaker lors de conférences, meetups, talks, auprès des écoles, …

 

Et si tu as d'autres envies, on en discute. Chacun est différent et on fait au cas par cas.

 

 

💰 Combien tu vas gagner chez SFEIR ?

 

Chez nous, pas de grille de salaire figée dans le marbre ! Cependant, il est important pour nous de garder une homogénéité dans les salaires en se basant sur les compétences et le marché actuel.   

 

On pourra t’en dire plus dès que tu auras passé notre process de recrutement technique, les PlayOffs, car les salaires que nous proposons ne prennent pas en compte ton âge, tes diplômes ou ton background. Tes compétences, rien que tes compétences !

 

En revanche, on peut te dire que, peu importe le salaire, un “Comité Carrière” annuel suit ton évolution et te permet de revoir ta rémunération chaque année. 

 

Tu bénéficieras également des avantages suivants : 

 

🔹 Matériel mis à disposition : MacBook Pro ou Dell ;

🔹 Véhicule de fonction et carte carburant (pas obligatoire) ;

🔹 Assurance santé complémentaire ;

🔹 Carte restaurant Pluxee ;

🔹 Prime d’intéressement ;

🔹 Crédit formation de 2500 euros (tous les deux ans) pour te permettre de te former/certifier et d’assister aux meilleures conférences dans le monde ! 

 

 

💻  Présentiel ou télétravail ?

 

Les deux, mon capitaine !

 

On s’adapte à nos clients, mais la plupart sont en hybride. On se doit simplement de respecter la limite légale pour les frontaliers.

 

 

👋  “Je suis intéressé(e), comment vous rejoindre ?”

 

Si cette annonce a attiré ton attention, il ne te reste plus qu'à postuler ! 

 

@Jonathan Wolter et @Julien Pawlowski se feront un plaisir de t'en dire plus.

 

Tu pourras ensuite te frotter à nos célèbres PlayOffs : 3 tests d'évaluation technique en pair-programming (algorithmie, langage, framework). 

 

Tu trouves ça effrayant ? Pas de panique, notre équipe d'évaluation fait preuve de bienveillance 😉

 

Ils te donneront aussi un aperçu de la culture d’entreprise et de la vie chez nous ! Tu pourras aussi discuter avec un commercial qui te présentera nos clients et projets, si tu le souhaites.

 

Max 2 jours après les PlayOffs, on revient vers toi pour te débriefer, et :

 

🔹 Soit, on te dit sur quels aspects tu peux encore progresser et on te donne des billes pour que tu puisses retenter ta chance après un peu de pratique ;

 

🔹 Soit, on te fait une proposition d’embauche.

 

Si tu as encore des questions, contacte-nous sur LinkedIn !

 

Et sinon, clique sur Postuler ✌️

Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead.

About The Team

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office.

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$174,400 - C$261,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

The HR Reporting and Insights group, supporting the broader People Analytics function, is currently in need of additional support to meet growing demands. This team’s responsibilities are a hybrid of business analysis and systems analysis, with a strong emphasis on working with data. Key tasks include creating HR reports, conducting testing and validation of data, and utilizing tools such as Power BI, Excel, and SQL scripting. The group plays a vital role in ensuring accurate and timely reporting for internal stakeholders.

Project Overview

The project involves supporting the Senior Manager of Reporting and Insights in developing and maintaining HR reporting solutions. These solutions are built using a range of platforms, including SuccessFactors People Analytics and Power BI. The role also includes tier 2 support for resolving issues escalated from Employee Services teams, performing quality assurance testing on HR reports, and facilitating communication with both HR and non-HR stakeholders to ensure reporting needs are met and maintained.

Candidate Value Proposition

This opportunity offers the successful candidate exposure to formal training in data analytics tools, as well as hands-on experience with the Bank’s data warehouse and repositories. Unlike solitary analyst roles, this position involves significant collaboration with various business units, offering valuable exposure to teamwork and project-based work environments.

Typical Day in the Role

The candidate will be expected to document and validate business requirements to guide the development of reports that serve multiple HR and business stakeholders. Daily tasks include developing reports in both SuccessFactors and Power BI, ensuring alignment with data management and privacy standards. The role provides support to global users, addresses technology issues escalated from Employee Services, and consults with the Employee Experience team for more complex issues.

In addition, the candidate will offer technical guidance on medium complexity database queries, scripting, and automation, supporting peers across the HR Reporting team. Responsibilities also include managing knowledge documentation for requirements, access protocols, roles, and data calculations. The candidate will collaborate with GHR Technology teams to coordinate system updates and configurations, research trends in HR technology, and contribute insights to leadership. Coordination with IT counterparts and external vendors is also required to maintain and troubleshoot reporting technologies. Core technical tasks involve generating Power BI reports based on set requirements, validating data using SQL, and supporting test activities through Excel functions like lookups.

Candidate Requirements / Must-Have Skills

Minimum of 3 years’ experience as a Data Analyst, specifically working with large datasets.
Basic proficiency in Power BI for report creation.
Intermediate experience in SQL scripting for data validation.
Intermediate Excel skills, including VLOOKUP and cross lookups.

Nice-to-Have Skills

Experience with HR systems, especially SuccessFactors People Analytics.
Python programming experience.
Familiarity with the Bank’s policies and procedures.
Background working in large, complex, and highly matrixed organizations.

Soft Skills Required

Candidates should possess strong analytical thinking, a high level of attention to detail, and the ability to manage multiple priorities independently. Effective written and verbal communication skills are essential.

Education Requirements

A post-secondary degree or diploma in Computer Science or a related technical field is preferred. Certifications in Power BI or Data Analytics would be considered an asset.

Ideal vs. Average Candidate

The ideal candidate is a seasoned data analyst with experience handling large data sets. Knowledge of HR data and prior experience with SuccessFactors would distinguish them from others. Given the short engagement timeline, the preferred candidate should be able to quickly integrate into the team, take initiative, and work with minimal supervision. Taking ownership of assigned tasks and being proactive is key to success in this role.

You'll collaborate deeply with leaders across Product, Engineering, Sales, and Customer Success to ensure we’re making the smartest possible decisions from day one.

About Valence

We're a Series A B2B SaaS company, backed by Insight Partners, that's pioneering the first generative AI leadership coach for large enterprises.

Reporting & Visualization
You’ll develop self-serve dashboards and recurring reporting frameworks to democratize access to data across teams
You will translate complex data into clear, compelling stories for technical and non-technical audiences to support data-informed decision-making
Data Infrastructure & Collaboration
You’ll collaborate with Product and Engineering teams to define tracking requirements and ensure accurate, consistent data collection
You’ll identify and recommend improvements to data processes that enhance quality, efficiency, and trust in analytics across the organization

You hold at least a Bachelor’s degree in Data Science, Statistics, Computer Science, Economics, or a related quantitative field
You are highly proficient in SQL and comfortable writing complex queries and working with diverse database structures

You’re familiar with BI tools such as Tableau, Looker, Power BI, or equivalent platforms
You’re familiar with using Excel or Google Sheets for ad hoc analysis and data exploration
You may also bring experience with product analytics platforms (e.g., Mixpanel, Amplitude), cloud environments (e.g., AWS or GCP), or data warehousing concepts
You know how to break down complex business problems into structured analyses
You are skilled at identifying trends, patterns, and outliers in data to uncover key insights
You can clearly communicate findings—both in writing and verbally—to technical and non-technical stakeholders alike
Nice to have: You’ve worked in a fast-paced, early-stage startup, you bring familiarity with AI/ML concepts, you understand SaaS metrics and enterprise customers



What you'll get


Ownership of projects and strategic priorities regardless of seniority
Strong ties to the executive team, a culture of transparency and engagement with strategic decisions

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources

Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We are seeking a Data Analyst for our Pipeline Inline Inspection (ILI) Data Analysis team.

DarkVision uses state-of-the-art proprietary acoustic imaging technologies to provide asset inspection services to industrial clients. This ultrasound system gathers immense datasets and identifies defects as small as a few millimeters. Automated processing, measurement, classification, and visualization algorithms are crucial due to the time-consuming and inconsistent nature of manual processing.

Join our team as we create a world of stories and knowledge, democratize the exchange of ideas and information, and empower collective expertise through our three products: Everand, Scribd, and Slideshare.

We support a culture where our employees can be real and be bold; where we debate and commit as we embrace plot twists; and where every employee is empowered to take action as we prioritize the customer.

When it comes to workplace structure, we believe in balancing individual flexibility and community connections. It’s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees – in partnership with their manager – can choose the daily work-style that best suits their individual needs. A key tenet of Scribd Flex is our prioritization of intentional in-person moments to build collaboration, culture, and connection. For this reason, occasional in-person attendance is required for all Scribd employees, regardless of their location.

So what are we looking for in new team members? Well, we hire for “GRIT”. The textbook definition of GRIT is demonstrating the intersection of passion and perseverance towards long term goals. At Scribd, we are inspired by the potential that this can unlock, and ask each of our employees to pursue a GRIT-ty approach to their work. In a tactical sense, GRIT is also a handy acronym that outlines the standards we hold ourselves and each other to. Here’s what that means for you: we’re looking for someone who showcases the ability to set and achieve Goals, achieve Results within their job responsibilities, contribute Innovative ideas and solutions, and positively influence the broader Team through collaboration and attitude.

Hierbij sta je in direct contact met het hoger management van bedrijven als Schiphol, Vopak en Pathé.




Wat ga je doen?

Wij zoeken een Junior BI Consultant die onze klanten ondersteunt bij het ontwikkelen en uitvoeren van hun informatiestrategie. Je houdt je bezig met het verzamelen, analyseren en visualiseren van data om waardevolle inzichten te creëren. Het bouwen en onderhouden van BI-dashboards doe je met tools zoals Power BI of Qlik.




Als BI Consultant werk je voornamelijk op locatie bij opdrachtgevers en speel je een actieve rol in de implementatie van datagedreven oplossingen binnen organisaties. Daarnaast begeleid je klanten gedurende het gehele proces, van analyse tot advies. De functie is veelzijdig, afwisselend en uitdagend, met veel verantwoordelijkheid. Afhankelijk van de situatie pak je deze uitdagingen zelfstandig aan of werk je samen in teamverband.







Wat krijg je van ons?

Je collega’s zijn ambitieus en gecertificeerd in hun specialisme.

Wij zorgen ervoor dat je op de hoogte blijft van de laatste ontwikkelingen in de markt en dat er een samenleving ontstaat tussen de verschillende specialisaties. Heb je nog geen BI certificeringen? Dan ga je die bij ons zeker halen! De sfeer is collegiaal, open en direct.

Een goed salaris wat lig tussen € 2.700 en € 3.400,- bruto per maand op fulltime basis, afhankelijk van de ervaring die je meebrengt
Opleidingsmogelijkheden en veel aandacht voor persoonlijke ontwikkeling
Ruimte voor pionieren met nieuwe tools en voor eigen initiatief
Hoogopgeleide, gecertificeerde collega’s die graag hun kennis met je delen
Een bonusregeling
Uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals mobiele telefoon, laptop en auto van de zaak
Een potje tafelvoetbal wanneer je op kantoor bent




Wat zoeken we in jou?

Je bent afgestudeerd en hebt een HBO-studieachtergrond met BI ervaring of WO-studieachtergrond (Economisch, financieel, bedrijfskundige informatie, technische bedrijfskunde, Business IT/Analytics).
Je hebt goede beheersing van de Nederlands en Engels taal in zowel woord als geschrift
Je hebt goede communicatieve vaardigheden, luistert actief, je bezit overtuigingskracht en organisatiesensitiviteit
Je bent stressbestendig, initiatiefrijk en toont inzet en ambitie.
Je hebt een analytische aanleg en je organiseert het werk en projecten.
Je weet kansen in je omgeving te benutten, hebt aandacht voor kwaliteit en hebt een resultaatgerichte houding
Je hebt een heldere visie op het vakgebied, je kan zelfstandig opereren en hecht daarbij waarde aan het werken in teamverband.




Wie zijn wij?

E-mergo is gespecialiseerd in Business Intelligence oplossingen. Wij zijn een kennisintensief bedrijf met medewerkers die gespecialiseerd zijn in Business Intelligence oplossingen. Onder het motto ‘Manage your data, innovate your business’ helpen wij organisaties het maximale om uit hun data te halen.

Dit doen wij met behulp van de oplossingen van Qlik, TimeXtender en Microsoft, waarvoor wij software, consultancy en beheer leveren.

Hiermee bieden wij zinvolle informatie waarmee organisaties sneller en slimmer beslissingen kunnen nemen. E-mergo heeft in de Business Intelligence markt een unieke positie met betrekking tot BI software.

Wij zijn één van de Elite partners van Qlik in Nederland, en daarnaast TimeXtender partner of the year van de Benelux en Microsoft Solution Partner. Naast onze professionele werkzaamheden vinden wij het sociale aspect ook erg belangrijk. Zo gaan wij jaarlijks met een groep op wintersport en houden wij maandelijkse teammeetings. Hierbij ontstaat altijd een mix van inhoudelijke onderwerpen en collegiale gezelligheid.




Sollicitatieprocedure:

Wanneer jouw studieachtergrond en/of werkervaring aansluit bij de vacature, nodigen wij je uit voor een kennismakingsgesprek. Als dit gesprek goed verloopt en er een duidelijke connectie ontstaat, volgt er een tweede gesprek. Voor dit gesprek ontvang je per e-mail een opdracht waar je zelfstandig aan zult werken.




De opdracht bestaat uit het bouwen van je eerste BI-dashboard.

Dit dashboard presenteer je tijdens het tweede gesprek aan ons MT, dat je hierover vragen zal stellen. Zijn zij tevreden over jouw dashboard? Dan nodigen we je direct uit voor een derde gesprek, dat aansluit op jouw presentatie. Tijdens dit gesprek ontvang je ons fantastische arbeidsvoorwaardenvoorstel.




PS Het voordeel van het maken van jouw eerste BI-dashboard is dat je tijdens de opdracht zelf kunt ontdekken of de rol van BI Consultant echt bij je past.




Bij E-mergo geloven we dat verschillen ons samen sterker en beter maken en staan we voor gelijke carrièrekansen voor iedereen. We streven naar een inclusieve cultuur, waarin verschillen worden herkend, gewaardeerd en benut. En we sluiten niemand buiten.




Enthousiast?

We kijken ernaar uit om met jou in gesprek te komen en meer over jou te weten! We ontvangen daarom graag jouw sollicitatie via de sollicitatiebutton of via een mail naar recruitment@e-mergo.nl. Voor vragen mag je natuurlijk altijd even contact opnemen.

Ondertussen weet je; met cijfers en data bezig zijn is helemaal jouw ding. Maar de wereld van online advertising lijkt je ook razend interessant. Waar kies je voor? Wat nou als je bij ons die twee werelden kunt combineren in de functie van Junior Paid Advertising & Data-analist? Gewapend met een berg enthousiasme en nieuwsgierigheid durf jij de uitdaging wel aan. Misschien weet je nog lang niet alles, maar wij brengen je met alle liefde de fijne kneepjes van het vak bij. Binnen no-time maak jij je collega’s blij met een overzicht van de gevraagde data en boek je succes met online advertising. Je collega’s blij, Mobiel.nl blij en jij blij. Lekker bezig!

Dit zijn wij

Bij Mobiel.nl vinden we dat iedereen vrij en bewust een abonnement moet kunnen kiezen. En dat is soms knap lastig, met al die providers die je voor zich proberen te winnen. Gelukkig snappen we de ingewikkelde telecomwereld als geen ander. Daardoor brengen we met gemak ál die abonnementsvormen en bijbehorende bundels en prijzen waarmee je om de oren wordt geslagen terug naar slechts een paar makkelijk te vergelijken persoonlijke aanbevelingen. Dat doen we met zo’n 120 collega’s. We werken hard, lachen veel en ontvangen iedere nieuwe collega met open armen.

Dit ga je doen


Je beheert en optimaliseert Google Ads- en Bing-campagnes en analyseert en rapporteert de prestaties.
Je draagt bij aan de strategieontwikkeling voor paid advertising.
Je test onze advertentieteksten en landingspagina’s aan de hand van A/B-tests.
Zie je kansen binnen betaalde kanalen? Dan grijp je die met beide handen aan.
Je verzamelt, transformeert en beheert data en voert er complexe analyses op uit.
Je helpt en ondersteunt onze collega’s bij het inzichtelijk maken en begrijpen van data. Daarvoor gebruik je Power BI en Google BigQuery.
Je denkt proactief mee over nieuwe inzichten en onbenutte kansen in onze data.



Dit ben jij


Learning on the job, dat is precies waar jij naar op zoek bent.
Je communiceert helder, hebt een sterk analytisch vermogen en bent resultaatgericht.
Paid advertising is een grote verantwoordelijkheid, maar daar deins jij echt niet voor terug.
Je voelt je thuis in de wereld van cijfers en data en kunt niet wachten om je daar verder in te ontwikkelen.
Heb je al ervaring met Power BI en SEA? Dan heb je een klein streepje voor.
Je bent minimaal 32 uur per week beschikbaar om als Junior Paid Advertising & Data-analist aan de slag te gaan.
Je hebt minimaal een wo-diploma op zak.
Je spreekt en schrijft vloeiend Nederlands.



Wij beloven


Een marktconform salaris, precies afgestemd op jouw niveau.
We zijn klein en informeel genoeg om je eigen ideeën te kunnen pitchen en vrijheid te hebben in je werk, maar groot genoeg om de rol interessant en uitdagend te maken én te houden. Een combinatie waar we trots op zijn!
25 vakantiedagen per kalenderjaar (op basis van 40 uur), reiskostenvergoeding, thuiswerkvergoeding en een prima pensioenregeling.
Korting op al onze abonnementen, telefoons en accessoires. Ook voor je vrienden en familie.



En dit ook


Buiten het werk doen we vaak leuke dingen met elkaar. We zijn een ster in borrelen, zijn competitief genoeg om elkaar sportief uit te dagen en je zal niet de eerste -en ook zeker niet de laatste- zijn die flink wat nieuwe vrienden maakt op de werkvloer.
We hebben een gezellige kantine waar je dagelijks kunt aanschuiven aan een gedekte lunchtafel. Op donderdag scoor je zelfs een huisgemaakt soepje.
Je hart kleurt in no time blauworanje. Echt waar.



Heb je nog vragen? Mail ze dan naar Lotte.

Zo word jij onze gloednieuwe Junior Paid Advertising & Data-analist:


Ben jij het talent dat we zoeken? Dan zijn we erg nieuwsgierig naar je motivatie en cv.
Als onze nieuwsgierigheid gewekt is, leren we je graag beter kennen in een eerste gesprek.
Zijn wij -en jij ook- enthousiast geworden na het eerste gesprek? Dan nodigen we je uit voor een tweede gesprek, met nog twee van onze collega’s. Natuurlijk zijn we ook benieuwd naar wat je kan, dus vragen we je dan ook een assessment te maken.
Na overleg met jou, bellen we graag even met je huidige of vorige werkgever om te horen of zij net zo enthousiast zijn als wij.
Je mag het goede nieuws van de daken schreeuwen. Jij bent onze nieuwe Junior Paid Advertising & Data-analist.



Hi recruiter! Leuk dat je onze vacature bekijkt en dat je staat te trappelen om de perfecte kandidaat voor te stellen. Helaas doen wij onze werving zelf en staan we dus niet open voor een samenwerking.
