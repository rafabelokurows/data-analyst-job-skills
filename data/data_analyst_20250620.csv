Requirements

Over 4 years of experience
In a commercial, fast-paced organization
Solid knowledge of SQL and experience with dbt, Databricks, Power BI, and Python
Strong interpersonal and communication skills
Located in the Netherlands




EQOM Group is a major force in Europe‚Äôs sexual wellness industry. As the company continues to professionalize and grow, data plays an increasingly vital role. The Data Analyst helps unlock the full potential of data, translating it into actionable insights and practical solutions to create value and support the shift towards a more data-driven way of working.




About EQOM Group

In the fast-paced and competitive world of sexual wellness, EQOM Group stands out as one of Europe‚Äôs most prominent and rapidly expanding names. Its portfolio includes a range of well-known consumer brands such as EasyToys, Christine le Duc, Amorelie, Kondomeriet, and Beate Uhse. The group was formed in 2020 through the merger of EDC Retail ‚Äì a European market leader known for EasyToys ‚Äì and wholesale distributor Eropartner. Backed by private equity firm Waterland, EQOM accelerated its growth by acquiring Christine le Duc in the Netherlands, Kondomeriet and Nytelse in Norway, and Amorelie in Germany.




In subsequent years, the group further expanded its footprint across Europe. Today, EQOM serves customers in more than sixty countries. While the majority of sales take place online, several retail chains ‚Äì such as Kruidvat, Etos, and Hema in the Netherlands ‚Äì have also started to offer EQOM products.




Mission: become the market leader

At present, EQOM employs 360 people and generates approximately 160 million euros in annual revenue. The group is embarking on a new phase centered on further professionalization and operational alignment, guided by a clear ambition: to establish itself as the market leader in the sexual wellness industry.




Vacancy: Data Analyst

Recognizing the vital role data plays in the company‚Äôs success, EQOM Group is strengthening its Data Team with several data analysts who combine technical expertise, business understanding, and interpersonal skills. This team serves as a center of excellence for data professionals, driving high-quality analysis and insights. The Data Analyst contributes by developing data models, creating visualizations with PowerBI, uncovering meaningful insights, and delivering practical solutions that improve decision-making across departments including e-commerce, logistics, finance, sales, and purchasing ‚Äì serving both B2B and B2C operations.




However, real impact arises from understanding what the business truly needs. The Data Analyst should apply interpersonal skills to listen carefully, interpret insights, and challenge colleagues to explore new perspectives on how data can generate value beyond traditional dashboards.

Reporting to the Head of Data, the Data Analyst works with tools such as Databricks, Power BI, and dbt to build data pipelines, model data, and generate analytical insights. The immediate focus lies on strengthening the current setup to make it more effective and robust. At the same time, ongoing improvements in how EQOM Group supports its customers lead to new data streams and formats that will need to be integrated moving forward.




‚ÄúEQOM‚Äôs data maturity is still evolving ‚Äì making this the perfect moment to join. Every contribution is immediately visible and makes a tangible difference. For a data expert who thrives on building, connecting, and solving, this role offers the chance to help a company take huge steps forward.‚Äù ‚Äì Ronald van den Berg, CFO




The ideal candidate is a curious and motivated professional who knows how to ask the right questions, even when problems are not yet clearly defined. Seniority is measured less by years of experience, but more by a demonstrated track record of using data effectively to create value and drive business growth. Equally important is the ability to build strong relationships with colleagues and earn their trust, both in the role and in the power of data. To foster these connections, spending time on-site in Veendam ‚Äì ideally at least once every two weeks ‚Äì is an essential part of the role.

Job Description

Traveloka is one of the largest Online Travel Agencies (OTA) in Southeast Asia. Offering financial products to support purchasing power and protecting our users provides the opportunity for tremendous innovation, and requires balancing risk that does not exist in other domains. With our expanding product and market footprint, we have several openings in our Insurance product domain.

As a Data Analyst (DA) for the Insurance product at Traveloka, you will work in a diverse team of Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers as critical partners to the business. Our focus is on growing a sustainable ecosystem by providing our customers with various protection offerings suitable to their needs.

We need you to be a do-er, and when you find interesting questions, you never let them sit for long without answers. You examine the available data from the lens of proactively thinking about the needs of our customers and the business, anticipating customer needs and market trends. DAs are critical roles within our business and you know that you can make the greatest impact by gaining in-depth and comprehensive business domain knowledge, and judiciously applying your analytical talents to the domain.

In turn, we‚Äôll provide you with a mature analytics environment to work in. Reproducibility and full version control is a default in our systems so that you can easily learn from your teammates and build on foundations that have already been developed. Our collaborative team will ensure that you‚Äôre more productive than you‚Äôve ever been in a few short months.

Our techstack: BigQuery, dbt, Python, Github, Airflow, Google Cloud Build

Main Responsibilities


Understand the insurance products, our customers, the market environment and the interplay between each of these. Be able to analyze how changes in any of these will affect various metrics, and come up with new metrics to guide the business.
Develop dashboards not just for monitoring, but to produce actionable insights that decision makers can use to steer the business.
Work with the business to answer tactical questions, often via our experiments platform, that will affect the development of product features.
Work with the business to answer strategic questions that will affect the long-term goals of the business.
Develop ETL pipelines within a robust framework that is highly automated and does not require a large team to maintain and monitor.
Understand when speed is more important than accuracy in arriving at an analytical result for the business to make a decision.
Enable our key stakeholders to improve their understanding and analytical power.


‚Äé

Requirements


Minimum 2 years of analytics experience in an industry setting
You have to be curious and hungry to learn, as well as excited to share knowledge with other team members
Experience with large and sometimes messy data
Comfortable working with open-ended questions and potentially ambiguous problem statements
Experience in collaborating with people outside your domain to deliver impact
At least a Bachelor degree in a quantitative subject, e.g. finance, financial mathematics, computer science, mathematics, physics, bio-informatics, engineering
Strong in data manipulation and inferential statistics with Python and SQL
Existing business domain knowledge in any financial service product (lending/insurance/payment/etc.) is preferred but not required

If you like wild growth and working with happy, enthusiastic over-achievers, you'll enjoy your career with us!

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies‚Äîfrom the world‚Äôs largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups‚Äîuse Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone‚Äôs reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Risk Operations team is looking for an experienced fraud analyst to join an industry leading global fraud operations team. This position is responsible for conducting complex data analysis to identify & mitigate large scale distributed fraud attacks, working closely with fraud strategy/detection/data science to implement mitigations, and working collaboratively with fraud stakeholders to expand automated detection of fraudulent merchants. They should have a deep understanding of fraud patterns/typologies, advanced SQL proficiency, and strong analytical abilities.

What you‚Äôll do

Did you know that only around 4% of the world‚Äôs GDP comes from internet commerce? At Stripe, we believe that this represents a future with almost limitless potential for innovation, creativity and global prosperity. While the promise of a global online economy is palpable, it doesn‚Äôt come without significant risk. Each day, bad actors disrupt the trust and safety of the internet and increase the barrier of entry for online businesses. Before we can fully realize the potential of a global internet economy, we must first address the burgeoning problem of fraud.

We are looking for someone passionate about fighting fraud, identifying new trends/typologies, conducting complex data analysis, and has a strong desire to work collaboratively with peers and partners in the fraud space. This position works closely with cross-functional stakeholders across product, engineering, data science, and operations to identify and mitigate risk from complex, distributed merchant and transaction fraud attacks.

The right candidate for this role will have a minimum of three years experience conducting complex data analysis using SQL, preferably within the fraud space across ecommerce or payments. Candidates should also have experience working closely with engineering and data science teams to drive automated fraud detection and demonstrate a deep understanding of fraud typologies, controls, and ability to mitigate fraud risk.

Responsibilities


Conduct advanced data analysis of structured and unstructured data sets to proactively identify emerging complex fraud attacks impacting Stripe and its users.
Investigate, conduct root cause analysis, and deploy remediations to prevent future complex and distributed fraud attacks encompassing merchant fraud, transaction fraud, card testing, and local payment methods.
Investigate and take action against anomalous clusters of merchants based on account activity, processing volume, or other risk indicators while minimizing negative impacts to Stripe users.
Work in lockstep with engineering and data science teams to enhance automated detection and actioning of fraudulent accounts to minimize risks to Stripe and partner ecosystems.
Respond to high priority incidents involving complex fraud schemes to quickly mitigate exposure to Stripe, its users, and financial partners.
Utilize analytics to identify & implement initiatives to automate manual processes and workload across the organization.
Create visualizations, dashboards, and queries to drive visibility and oversight into organization impact, performance, and loss risks.
Utilize Stripe tools & systems to enable systematic actioning of fraudulent merchants, maintaining an extremely high level of accuracy to prevent negative user experience.

This role is ideal for someone who enjoys rolling up their sleeves, make sense out of unstructured data and build systems that make others more effective.

You'll be the connective tissue between our data, tools, and people‚Äîturning raw data into practical insights that enhance portfolio tracking, deal sourcing, and internal decision-making. You'll also help shape our internal data workflows, tooling stack, and light BI infrastructure.

We're not building complex machine learning models, but we are building thoughtful, reliable internal data systems - and we'd love your help.

What You'll Do

Portfolio Data & BI Foundations


Structure and manage key internal datasets related to portfolio performance, financials, and operational KPIs
Build dashboards and reports that help us track what matters across companies, sectors, and time
Benchmark portfolio metrics against market data (via tools like Affinity, Standard Metrics, or others)
Help evaluate, implement, and improve data tooling (Snowflake, Looker, Sigma, Affinity integrations, etc.)
Act as the internal owner for our data flows‚Äîidentify gaps, fix breakages, and communicate clearly with stakeholders.


Lightweight External Analysis


Support research efforts on sectors, markets, and emerging technologies - e.g., tracking valuations or sector trends over time
Assist with ad hoc projects using external datasets (Crunchbase, PitchBook, etc.)
Prepare simple, clear visualizations and summaries for internal decks or LP updates.


Who We're Looking For

This role is not for someone seeking cutting-edge ML work or a highly structured corporate analytics team. Instead, you should be someone who:


Has 1-3 years of relevant experience in data analytics, business intelligence, or adjacent roles (startups, ops, FP&A, venture platform, research, or consulting)
Is comfortable working solo on data problems, but knows when to ask questions or bring in help
Can, outside of analyzing data, build a story around it, including using visualization tools to make data insightful and accessible
Has solid experience with Excel and ideally BI tools (Looker, Tableau, Sigma, etc.). Bonus: familiarity with Python, SQL or light scripting
Has a strong sense of internal ""product ownership""‚Äîyou care about whether people actually use what you build
Is curious, pragmatic, and good at simplifying‚Äînot over-engineering
Can be trusted to interface with both junior and senior stakeholders, and explain technical things clearly
May not have VC experience (that's okay!), but is interested in startups, tech, or long-term investing.


Why This Role Might Be a Fit


You like simple, clear data and value clean dashboards over endless dashboards
You want a role with impact, ownership, and stability
You might have worked at a startup or small team, where you wore multiple hats and had to figure things out yourself
You want to own something end-to-end‚Äîfrom sourcing data to seeing decisions being made with it
You're a builder, you're happy to fix a bug, standardize a field name, or push a Slack update if it helps someone else
You want to work with one of the best team in Venture!



Benefits


25-day holidays
Generous parental leave
Private health insurance
Several off-sites with the team each year
Wellness budget

Our values




Extreme customer focus ‚ù§Ô∏è

Since we started Weld, putting our customers first has been and will continue to be our top priority. Our ability to make our customers happy will define our long-term success.




Move fast ‚ö°Ô∏è

Action beats inaction. Do things now. Not tomorrow. Our intent is not to sacrifice quality but to be efficient by not reinventing the wheel and focusing on the things that matter.




Dream big üöÄ

We chase the most ambitious ideas to advance our mission in ways that encourage experimentation, accept failure, and regularly deliver new value for our customers.




Our Mission

Today, being data-driven requires extensive tooling and expertise, which makes it out of reach for most companies. We believe there should be a simpler alternative that enables all businesses to become truly data-driven.




Weld was founded in Copenhagen in 2021 by tech entrepreneurs Jonas Thordal, Jakob Skytte, Jakob Kristensen and Kristian Barrett. All four were early members of the startup success Pleo, where they helped build the data infrastructure from scratch.




That‚Äôs when they saw that getting value out of data was a lot easier said than done, so they decided to build a better solution.




We're backed by forward-thinking investors - Cherry Ventures and Frontline Ventures

Moller - Maersk,"Copenhagen, Capital Region of Denmark, Denmark","Why Join Us?

Join a pioneering team that‚Äôs reshaping the future of global Ocean logistics. At the intersection of technology, data, and strategic decision-making, you'll have direct impact‚Äîtransforming how we price, operate, and innovate at scale. Your analyses won't just influence products; they'll steer business-critical decisions, driving measurable commercial impact. Expect high visibility, rapid learning, and collaborative colleagues deeply committed to growth, experimentation, and responsible scaling. Be part of the journey where your insights fuel smarter, faster, and more confident global logistics decisions.

About The Role

We‚Äôre looking for a structured, curious, and impact-driven Quantitative Product Analyst to join our Product team working on dynamic pricing in global Ocean logistics. You‚Äôll help us measure and improve the real-world performance of our pricing algorithms‚Äîfrom bookings and revenue to customer behaviour and internal trust.

This is a hands-on, high-exposure role ideal for someone early in their career with strong foundations in quantitative methods. We welcome candidates from diverse applied backgrounds‚Äîincluding marketing measurement (incremental ROAS, geo-lift, MMM), energy or volatility trading (e.g., power/commodity/financial option markets), and economic evaluation. If you enjoy bringing clarity to complexity, structuring ambiguous problems, and informing decision-making through data, this role is definitely for you.

What you'll be doing:


Partner with product managers and data scientists to define success metrics and develop robust evaluation frameworks for algorithmic pricing models.
Analyze production data to assess commercial impact across bookings, revenue, and customer behaviour.
Design and interpret experiments and quasi-experiments (e.g., A/B testing, synthetic control, difference-in-differences) to evaluate pricing and product changes.
Help develop dashboards, alerts, and performance tracking tools for algorithm monitoring.
Communicate findings clearly across technical and non-technical audiences to influence product and commercial decisions.
Work closely with pricing, commercial, and analytics teams to ensure performance metrics are aligned with strategic objectives.


To succeed in this role, we believe that you can offer:


Bachelor‚Äôs or Master‚Äôs degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Economics, Engineering, Statistics, Applied Math, Computer Science, or Energy Systems)
3‚Äì7 years of experience in a data-intensive or modeling-heavy role (e.g., marketing analytics, trader, data analyst, pricing analyst, or economist)
Proficiency with Python and SQL; ability to manipulate and analyze large datasets
Familiarity with causal inference methods, experimental design, and time-series analysis
Strong analytical thinking, business acumen, and communication skills


Preferred Backgrounds:

We welcome a range of applied experience, some examples include:


Marketing measurement, such as media mix modelling (MMM), geo-experimentation, or incremental ROAS analysis
Energy or volatility trading, including demand forecasting and pricing under uncertainty
Quantitative economics, especially with experience in policy impact evaluation, structural modelling, or applied econometrics


If you are ready to take on this challenge and make a tangible difference, let's connect. We're excited to see what you‚Äôll bring to the team!

Responsibly is a sustainability tech start-up with the vision of making every purchase in the world responsible.




We're founded by two serial entrepreneurs with previous successes such as Dixa and Ofload, and have received pre-seed funding from some of Europe‚Äôs top VCs and angels. We're now building a top-tier team to tackle this big thing called climate, and have fun while we're doing it ü§ò.




Let‚Äôs change the world together üéØ




There‚Äôs no bigger problem out there than the changing climate, and procurement represents a big part of the solution - when purchase decisions are made on the background of responsible data, such as CO2 footprint, suppliers have a huge incentive to change.




However, procurement is becoming overloaded with complexity and struggle getting data in the first place. Different frameworks, different data sources, different coverage, and an overloaded supplier making it difficult to make purchase decisions to improve the sustainability of your supply chain.




At Responsibly, we're solving this issue by using ai to power your sustainability due dilligence and automatically understand how sustainable every supplier is.


Tasks


What you‚Äôll be doing üôå

We're looking for an intern to join our ESG operations team. That means you'll get deep experience with ESG data, ai and automation. You'll be:





Analyzing supplier sustainability data collected through our automation engines and flagged for review


Working on our ai and automation agenda to ensure every supplier can run through a fully automated due dilligence journey - that means diving deep on ai technologies and operational processes.


Quality assuring the data in the Responsibly platform to ensure we're representing the sustainability profile of the supplier as best as possible.


Supporting our Data Operations team with day-to-day tasks and long-term strategic milestones





You may also be supporting our ESG expertise team, which could include:





Interpret various social & environmental impact certificates and assessment scores according to our proprietary scoring methodology


Identify new sources for responsible sourcing data by assessing various supplier websites



Requirements


About you üòé





You have some practical experience through an internship/business study activity in analytical environments, where you‚Äôve had to navigate and make sense of complex problems


You want to build a career in sustainability and ai


You are a strong problem solver with excellent structure, and love analyzing data


You take a high degree of ownership in your work and are ready to attack unfamiliar problems with enthusiasm and a bias for action!


It's a bonus if you have a good understanding of the sustainability space and are familiar with different sustainability frameworks and initiatives.


It's a bonus if you have some basic knowledge and understanding of SQL and databases


You thrive in a fast-moving environment and love being through into the deep-end


You're passionate about your work and ambitious


English is our working language, hence excellent skills are a must



Benefits


Your benefits ü§©





Awesome office and culture with amazing lunch right on Island's Brygge


We love to build an awesome culture and community in our office, but we also offer flexibility when you need it.


Lots of fun, such as our annual company events or Friday bars





Still need to be convinced? ü§î





It‚Äôs the opportunity to join an early-stage tech & social impact startup on an incredible journey. You‚Äôll have the independence and space to release your creativity.


You'll become a vital member of the team, and your efforts will have a direct impact on Responsibly‚Äôs success.


You‚Äôll be part of a dynamic company with enthusiastic and highly talented teammates from various backgrounds and countries ‚Äì always ready to share knowledge, support, and a beer! Successes are always shared together


We have fun and we make an impact - life is about more than work!





The internship is full-time (40 hrs/week), paid, and ideally for 6 months. The location is Copenhagen, and a European work permit is required.




PLEASE NOTE: Starting period is ideally July 2025.




Please clarify in your application the following points:





For how many months are you available for an internship?


When is your earliest starting date?





We encourage you to apply even if you don't fulfill all requirements, as we're looking for driven and passionate individuals who are willing to learn and grow. We look forward to reading your application! ü§ì

At Colliers, we empower individuals to shape the future of real estate. As a leading global real estate services and investment management company, we deliver expert advice to occupiers, owners, and investors across all property sectors. From advisory and brokerage services to valuation, project management, research and more - our professionals work collaboratively to deliver impactful results.

With our UK headquarters in London and 1,200+ experts based across 16 offices in the UK and Ireland, we pride ourselves on a culture of innovation, collaboration, and long-term career development.

Job Description

An immediate opportunity has arisen for a London-based property data analyst in Colliers UK Research & Economics Research Team at our Wigmore Street headquarters. The role will include assisting in the collection, processing and reporting of standard property market metrics across all sectors but will also be central to our in-house development and roll-out of an innovative data analytics platform. Assisting with our quarterly forecasting processes and overseeing our internal GIS offer are also part of the role (in-house training will be provided). The Data Analyst will work directly under the supervision of our Deputy Head of Department. The role will also have great visibility and will involve liaising with our IT and Marketing Departments.

Qualifications

The successful candidate will range from recent graduates to individuals with some related experience. In all instances, the successful candidate is likely to possess a working knowledge of Microsoft Office and familiarity with basic descriptive statistics. Some knowledge of inferential statistics (correlations, r2, etc) would be an advantage as is previous experience in research in real estate or related disciplines. Communication skills are important as the position requires considerable cross-disciplinary interpersonal contact. A degree in any related discipline is anticipated but any coursework related to economics, statistics, information technology or the like will be an advantage. The job is not an IT job, but if you can demonstrate experience or a personal working knowledge of API feeds this would set you apart as our databases are increasingly API fed. GIS experience is not essential but would help along with familiarity with Alteryx. Training will be offered.

What is on offer.

The successful candidate will receive compensation and benefits in line with experience. The on-the-job training will also provide career enhancing transferable skills. Above all, Colliers is a collaborative and collegiate workplace with a strong sense of community. The management structure is not overly hierarchical meaning that all employees have ready access to the full range of Colliers experience.

Additional Information

At Colliers, we are committed to providing an inclusive and accessible recruitment process. In line with the Equality Act 2010, we will accommodate any suitable candidate requiring assistance to attend or conduct an interview. If you need any adjustments or support, please let us know when either scheduling your interview or in your application cover letter. We are dedicated to ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and are here to support you throughout the process.
