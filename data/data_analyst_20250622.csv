At Colliers, we empower individuals to shape the future of real estate. As a leading global real estate services and investment management company, we deliver expert advice to occupiers, owners, and investors across all property sectors. From advisory and brokerage services to valuation, project management, research and more - our professionals work collaboratively to deliver impactful results.

With our UK headquarters in London and 1,200+ experts based across 16 offices in the UK and Ireland, we pride ourselves on a culture of innovation, collaboration, and long-term career development.

Job Description

An immediate opportunity has arisen for a London-based property data analyst in Colliers UK Research & Economics Research Team at our Wigmore Street headquarters. The role will include assisting in the collection, processing and reporting of standard property market metrics across all sectors but will also be central to our in-house development and roll-out of an innovative data analytics platform. Assisting with our quarterly forecasting processes and overseeing our internal GIS offer are also part of the role (in-house training will be provided). The Data Analyst will work directly under the supervision of our Deputy Head of Department. The role will also have great visibility and will involve liaising with our IT and Marketing Departments.

Qualifications

The successful candidate will range from recent graduates to individuals with some related experience. In all instances, the successful candidate is likely to possess a working knowledge of Microsoft Office and familiarity with basic descriptive statistics. Some knowledge of inferential statistics (correlations, r2, etc) would be an advantage as is previous experience in research in real estate or related disciplines. Communication skills are important as the position requires considerable cross-disciplinary interpersonal contact. A degree in any related discipline is anticipated but any coursework related to economics, statistics, information technology or the like will be an advantage. The job is not an IT job, but if you can demonstrate experience or a personal working knowledge of API feeds this would set you apart as our databases are increasingly API fed. GIS experience is not essential but would help along with familiarity with Alteryx. Training will be offered.

What is on offer.

The successful candidate will receive compensation and benefits in line with experience. The on-the-job training will also provide career enhancing transferable skills. Above all, Colliers is a collaborative and collegiate workplace with a strong sense of community. The management structure is not overly hierarchical meaning that all employees have ready access to the full range of Colliers experience.

Additional Information

At Colliers, we are committed to providing an inclusive and accessible recruitment process. In line with the Equality Act 2010, we will accommodate any suitable candidate requiring assistance to attend or conduct an interview. If you need any adjustments or support, please let us know when either scheduling your interview or in your application cover letter. We are dedicated to ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and are here to support you throughout the process.
