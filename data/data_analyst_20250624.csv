Datenpipeline-Know-how: Du arbeitest sicher mit Airflow und orchestriert SQL-basierte Datenmodelle effizient und zuverlässig.
Qualitätsbewusstsein: Du hast ein starkes Auge für Datenqualität und bringst Erfahrung mit Testing-Frameworks wie eigenen SQL-Tests oder Tools wie Great Expectations mit.

Warum wir?

Dich erwartet ein modernes und dynamisches Arbeitsumfeld mit einer Du-Kultur von Tag eins. Wir glauben an flache Hierarchien und agile Arbeitsmethoden. Unsere Teams bestehen aus jungen, hungrigen und motivierten Menschen, die etwas bewegen wollen.


Natürlich kommt der Spaß im Office nicht zu kurz: Wir lassen den Arbeitstag regelmäßig bei einer Runde Tischtennis, Fifa oder Mario Kart ausklingen.
Remote Work ist Standard bei uns - und wenn du doch mal in unser Büro in Mannheim oder Hamburg kommen möchtest kannst du dies mit deinem persönlichen Monatsbudget machen. (Je nach Position kann dies variieren)
Du hast die Möglichkeit dir ein Jobrad zu leasen, ein vergünstigtes RNV / HVV- Jobticket oder auch ein Deutschlandticket abzuschließen, da wir ein Office in Mannheim & Hamburg haben.
Der Mensch steht bei uns im Mittelpunkt: Ein Team aus A-Playern die nach Wachstum streben, zudem hast du Zugang zur Gesundheitsplattform nilo.health, kannst an den grandiosen SNOCKS Events oder einfach beim nächsten After-Work dabei sein.
Einen steuerfreien Sachbezug den du vielseitig einlösen kannst sowie eine betriebliche Altersvorsorge gehören ebenfalls zu deinen Vorteilen bei uns.
Dogsitting? Brauchst du nicht! Dein Vierbeiner ist bei uns im Office immer gerne gesehen.
Morgens vor der Arbeit Yoga und mittags zum Sport? Kein Problem, mit unseren flexiblen Arbeitszeiten kannst du Privat- und Berufsleben vereinen.
Unsere kostenlose Getränke, das frische Obst, unsere Lunch-Koch-Sessions, Kaffee aus der besten Siebträger-Maschine, die Müsli-Bar und vieles mehr halten dich erfrischt & energetisiert.
Noch keine SNOCKS-Produkte in deinem Kleiderschrank? Das ändern wir! Du erhältst jedes Jahr 360€ Gutschein von uns sowie weitere tolle Rabatte und Angebote wie bspw Corporate Benefits.
Auch in unserem Snocks Coffee bist du jederzeit herzlich Willkommen und erhältst Mitarbeitenden-Rabatt.
Du weißt nicht weiter? Wir unterstützen dich mit unseren Weiterbildungs-Angeboten und individuellen Development Budgets!
Onboarding ohne Geschenke und top Hardware? Gibts bei uns nicht.
Du bekommst zum Start alles was du benötigst und darfst dir auch Produkte von Partnern & Friends in unserem Welcome Shop aussuchen!
Wir supporten soziale Aktionen, daher gibts bei uns den „Social Day“, der eingesetzt werden kann, um Gutes zutun.
Mädels aufgepasst! Ihr leidet regelmäßig unter starken Regelschmerzen und schafft es nur mit Schmerzmitteln einigermaßen produktiv zu arbeiten? Schluss damit! Bei uns könnt ihr für solche Situationen „Power Days“ beantragen.
Workation-Mode on? Why not! Alleine, mit deinen Liebsten oder auch mit den Kolleg:innen einfach mal raus aus dem Büroalltag? Let's go!


Über uns

Familienunternehmen oder Big Player? Socken oder Unterwäsche? Stylisch oder schlicht? Ganz klar: alles!

Bei SNOCKS ruhen wir uns nicht darauf aus, wie Dinge schon immer gemacht wurden. Wir denken uns: Why not? Und zeigen, dass Qualität aufregend sein kann, dass Basic-Teile sexy sein dürfen und E-Commerce neu gedacht werden will. Wir verändern, bewegen und hinterfragen uns, verlieren dabei das Wichtigste aber nicht aus dem Blick: Qualität und Komfort bei unseren Produkten und ein geiles Team, das für sie brennt.

Am Anfang von SNOCKS stand die Idee der beiden Gründer Johannes und Felix, richtig gute Sneakersocken zu verkaufen. Zu den zwei Cousins haben sich mittlerweile über 100 Mitarbeitende gesellt und neben den rutschfesten Socken mit Anti-Loch-Garantie gibt es längst Unterwäsche und andere Basics für drunter.

Heute können wir voller Stolz und Überzeugung sagen: Wir machen nicht nur Socken. Wir machen den Unterschied.

________________________

Hello 👋 I am Puneet, Co- founder and CPO at Kayzen, and I am now looking for a Sr Data Analyst who will be part of our Data Analytics ( Data ) team. 🙌

But wait, you have not heard of Kayzen before? 😃

Kayzen is a mobile demand-side platform (DSP) dedicated to democratizing programmatic advertising. We enable leading apps, agencies, media buyers, and brands to run programmatic customer acquisition, retargeting, and brand performance campaigns through its self-serve and managed service options. Built on the three core pillars of performance, transparency, and control, Kayzen powers the world's best mobile marketing teams with bespoke solutions that fuel business growth and deliver a competitive advantage. With an unprecedented scale of 160B+ daily ad requests from 1.6B+ unique users worldwide, we serve up to 1B+ ads per day in 180 countries. Kayzen is accessible through our APIs and user interface.

The role

As a Sr Data Analyst, you will apply advanced descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive analytics to deliver high-value insights across multiple stakeholders. At Kayzen, our Data Analytics team operates within the broader ""Data Team,"" which also includes Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering. Collectively, the Data Team develops and deploys the machine learning models that power our clients' advertising performance in the programmatic ecosystem. Within this structure, the Data Analytics team serves as a critical bridge between the Data Team and the broader business units (e.g., campaign managers, business owners, product managers). You will champion a data-driven culture and empower teams across Kayzen to harness analytical insights in a consistent and impactful way.

Responsibilities

You will work on a vast variety of problem statements, such as feature engineering, A/B testing, fraud detection, bidding decisions to name a few examples. Your key responsibilities include:


Data-Driven Model Research: Provide in-depth research to inform machine learning model development, leveraging both internal and external data sources to generate actionable insights.
Analytical & Statistical Expertise: Serve as the primary source of rigorous analytics for various data problems, evaluating system performance , finding performance issues and devising solutions for them
Data Accessibility & Quality Control: Facilitate data access throughout the organization while maintaining a centralized oversight to guarantee data quality.


What this role is not about:


This is not a typical BI role, where you are just expected to receive requirements and build dashboards. At Kayzen, the Data Analyst role is more investigative and we need people capable of asking questions and answering them.
This is not a campaign management role, where you will be responsible for operational campaign optimization.


Requirements


2+ years of experience in the Ad-Tech industry, working in Data Analytics or related fields;
SQL (advanced);
Python (intermediate);
Expertise in data mining, processing, modeling and data visualization and strong analytical skills;
A results-driven, hands-on mindset that combines rapid experimentation, pragmatic problem-solving, and a passion for delivering exceptional customer-focused solutions;
High level of proactiveness and eagerness to solve issues;
A strong sense of ownership and strong work ethics;
Experience with Big Data technologies (Spark, HDFS, Hive, etc) is a plus;
Experience with Git and Airflow is a plus.


What do we offer?


Reporting directly to Co-founder & CPO
Direct access to top management and an extremely ""visible"" role
Exceptional career growth and learning opportunity
A unique opportunity to be part of an experienced team of industry experts and entrepreneurs who bring massive change to the Adtech market
Direct, day-to-day work experience with the management
A fun, driven, and multinational team located across Germany, India, UK, Argentina, Ukraine, Turkey, Spain and many more countries
A flexible work-from-home arrangement
A 500-dollar home-office setup budget
A 1000-dollar annual learning and development budget

At Gigs, we're building the operating system for mobile services—a platform that lets tech companies embed global connectivity into their products effortlessly.

Just as Stripe lets any business add a payment button in seconds, Gigs empowers platforms to weave in connectivity—bridging the traditional world of telecom with modern tech. From fintechs launching mobile services to HR platforms offering work phone plans, we automate provisioning and remove telecom complexity.

Our team of around 90 people across the US and Europe, backed by nearly $100 million in funding from Ribbit Capital, Google, and Y Combinator. As one of the fastest-growing tech companies, bringing together early-stage engineers, product builders, and business athletes from companies like Stripe, Airbnb, and Shopify. We're tackling deep technical and regulatory challenges to make connectivity truly seamless.

If you're driven by curiosity, creativity, and the chance to shape the future of telecom, we'd love to hear from you.

The Role

As a Senior Data Analyst, you'll be a foundational part of our data team — shaping how data is modeled, shared, and turned into insight across the company. You'll join a team of 3 spread across data engineering, analytics engineering and insight generation. This will be the second dedicated Senior Data Analyst in the team.

What You Will Do


Collaborate cross-functionally with teams like Finance, Growth, Product, and Operations to understand their needs and ensure data is actionable and impactful. This could mean delivering a dashboard, an insight, or a data model powering automation.
Be a thought partner on how we define core metrics, track business performance, and build trust in data across Gigs.
Empower internal teams by leveling up power users and educating data consumers, through clear communication, thoughtful documentation, stakeholder collaboration, and occasional training sessions.
Build the analytics content that matters, both internally and externally. You'll work with the Product team to identify key customer-facing metrics and play a crucial role in delivering those insights via dashboards and data products.
Not every data point is available yet. We all work end to end. Work with product to define new data points, translate messy source data into clean, reliable models that power dashboards, metrics, and product decisions.
You will work with a modern event-based data platform across Bigquery, Fivetran, dbt, dagster, Lightdash and Hex.


What We Are Looking For


6+ years of experience in analytics with a focus on end to end delivery. Having worked closely with Finance stakeholders, Product in a B2C context (to support customer launches and ongoing implementations) or experience with customer-facing data products are strong plus points.
A strong understanding of data modeling best practices (e.g. dimensional modeling, testing, documentation).
Skilled at building alignment and managing expectations with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Experience translating complex business requirements into well-structured data pipelines and models.
Familiarity with Git, CI/CD, Python and strong SQL.
A product mindset: you care about usability, performance, and building for scale. You see the content you deliver as a product and are interested in having those being used.
This is not your first rodeo. You have worked in small and early data teams, grown along side them and worked in larger teams and data platforms. You've seen what works and doesn't in both and are looking to apply this in your next role.
Clear communicator — you can work cross-functionally and explain complex topics to non-technical stakeholders
Strong bias for action: You move quickly, deliver incrementally, and aren't afraid to ship v1. You identify what's missing and work with stakeholders to fill the gaps.
Experience working in fast-moving startups or remote-first teams is a plus.


Work at Gigs

At Gigs, we know that different work styles and teams thrive in different environments. Some work best remotely, while others rely on in-person collaboration to spark creativity and drive execution. We're remote-friendly by design, but we also offer hubs for those who need the energy and focus that only in-person collaboration can bring.


Gigs Pads: Our hubs in San Francisco, London, Amsterdam, and Berlin are vibrant spots where Gigsters connect, collaborate, and create together.
Gigs Republic: Twice a year, our entire company comes together to strengthen bonds, align on big ideas, and share experiences that fuel our culture and ignite growth.


What We Offer

At Gigs, we believe in rewarding excellence. We offer competitive compensation and stock options because we see you as a true partner in our growth. We also provide stipends for your home office or work setup, a budget for learning and development to fuel your career, and of course, a free phone and international data plan

Deine Stärken. Unsere gemeinsame Wirkung.

We call our work ‘demonstrating impact'. That means an environment in which you can share your curiosity, knowledge and passion for excellence with others. Because our work demonstrates impact, Grant Thornton is one of the most successful firms for mid-market companies, start-ups and the DAX. With us you can support our clients' growth regionally, nationally and internationally, and at the same time broaden your view of the environment, society and economy.

We're growing. To complement our team we are looking for interns (m/f/d) and working students (m/f/x) for data analytics in the field of Audit & Assurance to join our team as soon as possible. In this business unit, we offer a broad range of services which includes a portfolio of data science methodologies and data engineering technologies. Our business focuses on holistic and tailor-made solutions for our clients - and not abstract analyses. We cover a wide range of topics when it comes to data engineering, descriptive data analytics such as BI and process mining and advanced machine learning.

You will support the team in at least one of the following fields, depending on your interest:


Support in managing internal and external data and innovation projects

Our motivation as your employer is to help realize your goals. We take your success personally. That's why we're committed: we offer you responsibility and life-long growth as part of a strong team that's shaping the future.

We are service-focused, yet also build open-source tools to deliver a more effective and efficient service. You can read more about our data philosophy here.

About The Job

Gemma Analytics helps startups and SMEs become truly data-driven.

As one of our (Junior) Analytics Engineers, you’ll play a key role in helping our clients turn raw data into meaningful business insights. Your superpower is not just understanding data – it's asking the right questions, seeing patterns others miss, and helping teams make smart, informed decisions.

You’ll work closely with clients to understand their business needs, uncover data opportunities, and build the foundations for robust, scalable analytics. In your first months, you'll be supported by experienced mentors to help you grow confidently into your role.

This role is ideal for someone with a strong business foundation who’s excited to dive deeper into the world of data.

Responsibilities


Collaborate closely with domain experts and business stakeholders to translate needs into data solutions
Develop clean, understandable data models and pipelines (we’re tooling-agnostic, so you’ll learn a lot!)
Build intuitive reports and dashboards that help clients track what matters
Explore and validate new tools and approaches in the modern data stack
Learn and grow alongside a supportive team of data & analytics engineers, data analysts and data consultants


Who You Are

We’re looking for someone with strong business acumen, analytical thinking, and a hunger to learn. You may have started your career in a business domain and are now eager to combine that experience with data to make an even bigger impact. You bring:


A degree in Business, Economics, or a related field — or hands-on business experience in a commercial, marketing, product, or operations role
OR a recent MBA or other advanced business training
First experience with SQL and relational databases
A curious, open mindset and the ability to think in both numbers and narratives


Bonus If You Also Have


Experience with a programming language (e.g. Python)
Familiarity with BI tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Looker
Experience managing stakeholders or cross-functional collaboration
A basic understanding of data modeling techniques (e.g. Kimball or Data Vault)
Business fluency in German and English (C1 or native level in both)
We welcome applications from all backgrounds — especially those underrepresented in tech and data. If you’re unsure whether you meet every single requirement, we still encourage you to apply. We’re looking for potential, not perfection.


Gemma Perks

We are located in Berlin, close to Nordbahnhof. We are currently 20 colleagues and will grow to 22 colleagues until the end of the year. Other perks include


We have an honest, inclusive work environment and want to nurture this environment
We have frequent team events in Berlin: our cultural base
We encourage workcations and even do workcations as a company - it is up to you to come to the office between two and five days a week
We don’t compromise on equipment - a powerful Laptop, extra screens, and all the tools you need to be effective
We will surround you with great people who love to solve (mostly data) riddles
We believe in efficient working hours rather than long working hours - we focus on the output rather than the input
We learn and share during meetups, lunch & learn sessions and are open for further initiatives
We pay a market-friendly salary and we additionally distribute at least 20% of profits to our employees
We are fast-growing, have technology at our core, yet we do not rely on a VC and operate profitably
We have a great yearly offsite event that brings us all together for a full week, enjoying good food, having a good time, and of course, solving complex data-related tasks solving complex data-related tasks
