The product

Next-generation data warehouses like Snowflake, Databricks, and Google BigQuery are becoming the standard place to centralize all your data since they have become affordable and highly performant.




Built around modern data warehousing, we provide state-of-the-art data infrastructure that works in a few clicks without data engineering. In that way, Weld enables powerful analytics and workflows that can make a company truly data-driven.




‚ö° Give the product a try; sign up at weld.app




The role

At Weld, we believe data should empower, not overwhelm, teams. As a Senior Data Analyst, you‚Äôll be critical in transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive internal decision-making and customer success. You'll work internally and directly with customers, helping them make sense of their data and unlock its full potential by using the Weld platform.




You‚Äôll support every data lifecycle stage, from designing and modeling warehouse schemas to crafting dashboards and running deep analyses. You‚Äôll also serve as a trusted partner to customers, helping them implement metrics, interpret data trends, and get value from their ETL and reverse ETL processes.




We're hoping that you;

are fluent in SQL and have experience with data modeling tools (like dbt or similar)
have a solid understanding of ETL, reverse ETL, and data warehousing best practices
are comfortable working with large datasets and drawing actionable insights
have a good understanding of statistics and experimental design
have strong communication skills and enjoy working directly with customers to understand their data needs
can clearly communicate complex findings to non-technical stakeholders
have experience mentoring junior analysts or collaborating cross-functionally with product and engineering teams
bonus points for experience using Python or R for data wrangling, automation, or statistical analysis, and with BI platforms like Power BI, Looker, Tableau, or Metabase.




The team

As generalists, we have expertise, are always open to new challenges, and offer assistance when needed. Currently, we seek individuals who are enthusiastic about learning and fearless in taking on end-to-end projects. We are looking for curious individuals who can take on a given problem and solve it. We particularly welcome entrepreneurial minds who thrive in the early stages of a startup.




How we work

We prioritize creating a vibrant, fun, exciting, and challenging culture. Our highly talented and passionate team, who firmly believe in the power of collaboration, makes this possible.




We value ownership and offer significant freedom and responsibility while fostering close teamwork. We are remote-friendly and strive to create the best office and remote experiences. We achieve this through various means, such as organizing social events and gatherings for team camps across the globe.




How to apply

Apply via LinkedIn

Mention 2-3 of your most significant achievements and 2-3 of the most important lessons you've learned in your career.




Some nice things about working at Weld üíõ

üí∞ Competitive salary and equity

üèùÔ∏è 6 weeks paid holiday per year

üëµ Company-paid pension scheme

üõü Company-paid health insurance

üë©‚Äçüè≠ Flexible working hours

‚úàÔ∏è Every quarter, we spend 3 to 4 days together enjoying social activities, team building, and having lots and lots of fun!

üí≥ Everyone gets a company card from day one. Meaning that you can buy your own things for work whenever needed

üá©üá∞ We have a nice office space in central Copenhagen right next to the Opera

üåç We are remote-friendly, and everyone who joins has the option to work from anywhere CET +/- 3h

ü•ô Everyone who joins the Copenhagen office gets free lunch

Our values




Extreme customer focus ‚ù§Ô∏è

Since we started Weld, putting our customers first has been and will continue to be our top priority. Our ability to make our customers happy will define our long-term success.




Move fast ‚ö°Ô∏è

Action beats inaction. Do things now. Not tomorrow. Our intent is not to sacrifice quality but to be efficient by not reinventing the wheel and focusing on the things that matter.




Dream big üöÄ

We chase the most ambitious ideas to advance our mission in ways that encourage experimentation, accept failure, and regularly deliver new value for our customers.




Our Mission

Today, being data-driven requires extensive tooling and expertise, which makes it out of reach for most companies. We believe there should be a simpler alternative that enables all businesses to become truly data-driven.




Weld was founded in Copenhagen in 2021 by tech entrepreneurs Jonas Thordal, Jakob Skytte, Jakob Kristensen and Kristian Barrett. All four were early members of the startup success Pleo, where they helped build the data infrastructure from scratch.




That‚Äôs when they saw that getting value out of data was a lot easier said than done, so they decided to build a better solution.




We're backed by forward-thinking investors - Cherry Ventures and Frontline Ventures
