About The Team

Are you ready for one of the great infrastructure challenges of the 2100s? To truly transform into a decentralized power grid that can support a fully electrified, renewable future, millions of homes need to be equipped with smart meters and control systems. At Enpal MSB, we are performing the fastest roll-out in the German market at unprecedented scale, shaping the way this digitally transformed grid will operate.

Join our energetic and driven team as we turn our internal solutions into backbone infrastructure products to enable utilities, grid operators, and emerging energy providers to install and operate smart meters at scale. We achieve this by being a fast and independent unit built on interdisciplinary collaboration, where we work cross-functionally across technical and non-technical roles, putting a passion for the problems above traditional role boundaries.

Job Description

We are looking for a (Product) Data Analyst (f/m/d) to join our Smart Metering (MSB) team and play a key role in shaping our digital products and operational infrastructure through data. In this role, you will work at the intersection of energy data, regulation, and product development – turning raw metering and operational data into insights, models, and scalable data services. You’ll be embedded in a cross-functional team alongside Product Managers, Engineers, and Operations specialists, enabling our rollout from tens of thousands to millions of smart meters.

This is a high-impact role for someone who loves solving messy data problems, automating manual workflows, and enabling decision-making through clean, reliable data pipelines.

Responsibilities


You will build and maintain core datasets that power our digital smart metering products and operational reporting
You will design, implement, and validate data models that support regulatory market communication, device operations, and forecasting models
You will analyze data quality, detect anomalies, and propose improvements to our metering and backend processes
You will support PMs with ad-hoc analysis, business case modelling, and KPI tracking; and you will work closely with engineering and data platform teams to define and improve data interfaces (e.g. APIs, ETL pipelines)
You will ensure data consistency and lineage across multiple systems
You will develop dashboards and self-service tools for internal users
You will translate regulatory requirements into data logic that can be operationalized and audited



Qualifications


You have at least 2 years of hands-on experience in data analysis or analytics engineering, ideally in an infrastructure-heavy or regulated environment.
You bring hands-on experience with SQL and large, complex datasets, including raw time series data. You know how to clean and transform data into actionable insights, and have built dashboards and reports using BI tools (Tableau, Metabase, or Power BI).
Familiarity with Python, Snowflake, dbt, or data modeling concepts (e.g., dimensional modeling, staging layers) is a nice-to-have, as is experience with energy market data flows or smart metering.
You communicate clearly in English. Knowledge of German is a plus.
You enjoy working in agile, cross-functional teams and take ownership beyond writing queries, contributing to the design and improvement of data systems as a whole.

About the workplace

The Vancity Analytics Centre of Excellence (ACE) is a force for change. Our mandate is simple - we leverage our data with actionable insights that help our leaders make stronger decisions. We use a deeply human approach - telling stories in the language of our stakeholders with a proactive and predictive lens. We don’t rely on complex charts; we focus on the ‘so what’ of every question and insight to deliver value. We work collaboratively with our colleagues to serve our members and our business.




This is a permanent, full-time role that will enjoy hybrid working arrangements which can be fulfilled primarily from the Vancity head office location and your Lower Mainland based home office. Periodically, you’ll be required to attend in-person activities or events.




A typical day would involve:

Supporting multiple lines of business as a trusted partner to support decision makers with actionable insights leveraged from Vancity’s rich data.
Humanizing insights from data by crafting narratives with analysis and a clear ‘so what’ with measurable recommendations. You’ll support this output by building analytical models, hypothesis validation, evaluating results from test & learn experiments, and handling ad hoc analysis requests.
Resolving complex information needs and translating them into executable research and analytics initiatives.
Supporting the director in compiling and communicating research and analytics insights to enable the delivery of key business strategies and decisions.
Identifying emerging trends, risks and opportunities, assess implications, and make recommendations to management to mitigate potential risks and identify potential opportunities for the business.
Working closely with the Analytics Centre of Excellence and in collaboration with leaders, business stakeholders, consultants, and external agencies/data providers as needed. This role has significant exposure to the VP level.




You have:

Excellent analytical thinking capability, skilled at probing stakeholders to uncover business problems and translating these into analytical questions and summarizing insights to reach conclusion
Excellent communication skills. Strong ability to explain complicated ideas to broader audiences using non-technical language
Strong presentation skills, able to organize information and present analytical results in an efficient manner
Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Computer Science, Economics, Finance, or other quantitative fields
5-7 years of experience in analytics
Thorough working knowledge of relational databases and advanced SQL data extraction and manipulation tools (must have)
Proficiency with: R/Python, Power BI / Tableau. Working level statistical skills, including regression, time series, champion/challenger testing, and decision tree modeling
Ability to access complex data sources, explore data resources, clean and compile data to provide analytical driven solutions to real business problems
You are familiar with best practices in statistical methodologies and innovative analytical tools, and can leverage this knowledge to support our business stakeholders to make stronger decisions

Bonus points, if you have:

Experience in any of the following domains would be considered an asset: financial services/banking, credit cards/payments, credit risk, marketing campaigns, CRM, call center operations




You are:

Passionate about giving meaning to data
Someone who enjoys investigating complex problems, and making sense of information and thinking conceptually
Comfortable with ambiguity




We value lived experience, so if you are interested in this role, we encourage you to apply even if you feel your skills don't perfectly align with those listed.




The salary range for this role is $81,200 to $122,000 annually. Base pay offered may vary depending on factors such as relevant qualifications, skills, previous experience, and internal equity. As part of our total rewards package, employees may also be eligible for our annual incentive program, subject to program eligibility requirements.

The Position

Uplight is creating a new category of energy. We make software that manages energy resources in homes and businesses—including things like smart thermostats, electric vehicles, solar panels, storage batteries, heat pumps, and even people’s behavior—to generate, shift, or save energy to balance the grid, making it more efficient and reliable. This creates clean energy capacity that can be used by the power grid instead of burning more fossil fuels. Our solutions accelerate the transition to clean energy and save money for energy customers.

We are seeking a Data Engineer focusing on data platform enablement to support our mission and scale our impact

How You Will Make An Impact

As a Data Engineer at Uplight, you’ll play a central role in designing and maintaining the infrastructure that ingests, transforms, and delivers data across our platform. Your work ensures that data systems are reliable, scalable, observable, and cost-efficient—forming the backbone of many customer-facing and data science-driven solutions.

You’ll partner with cross-functional teams including analysts, product managers, and data scientists to ensure the platform meets the evolving needs of our business and our users.

What You Get To Do


Design, build, and maintain data pipelines using Databricks (Spark, Delta Lake) and Python.
Collaborate across teams to develop core platform capabilities—such as orchestration, metadata management, and data quality—delivering scalable, reusable solutions
Improve reliability and fault tolerance of ingest pipelines handling large volumes of utility data.
Build and support MLOps tooling, including data pipelines, model registries, and serving infrastructure
Participate in the full software development lifecycle: design, build, test, deploy, and support
Contribute to a remote-first team that values agility, collaboration, and clarity—favoring whiteboarding, async design docs, and reflective retros over rigid ceremonies.
Continuously learn and grow with support from senior engineers and team leads
Help maintain a team culture rooted in curiosity, empathy, and continuous improvement


What You Bring To Uplight


2–5 years of software engineering experience, ideally in backend or data-focused roles
Experience with Databricks, Spark, or similar big data technologies
Proficiency in Python and SQL
Exposure to cloud platforms such as GCP or AWS
Familiarity with CI/CD tools and infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Docker, Terraform, CircleCI)
Strong communication and collaboration skills; a team player excited to learn and grow


Bonus Points


Familiarity with MLOps concepts and tools (e.g., MLflow, model versioning)
Experience with real-time or streaming data systems (e.g., Kafka, Structured Streaming)
Understanding of data observability, lineage, and quality
Prior work in the energy or utility space
Strong grasp of Big Data challenges including cost vs performance tradeoffs


Don’t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women, marginalized genders and people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification. At Uplight we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.
