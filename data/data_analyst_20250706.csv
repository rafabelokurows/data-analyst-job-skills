About The Team

Are you ready for one of the great infrastructure challenges of the 2100s? To truly transform into a decentralized power grid that can support a fully electrified, renewable future, millions of homes need to be equipped with smart meters and control systems. At Enpal MSB, we are performing the fastest roll-out in the German market at unprecedented scale, shaping the way this digitally transformed grid will operate.

Join our energetic and driven team as we turn our internal solutions into backbone infrastructure products to enable utilities, grid operators, and emerging energy providers to install and operate smart meters at scale. We achieve this by being a fast and independent unit built on interdisciplinary collaboration, where we work cross-functionally across technical and non-technical roles, putting a passion for the problems above traditional role boundaries.

Job Description

We are looking for a (Product) Data Analyst (f/m/d) to join our Smart Metering (MSB) team and play a key role in shaping our digital products and operational infrastructure through data. In this role, you will work at the intersection of energy data, regulation, and product development – turning raw metering and operational data into insights, models, and scalable data services. You’ll be embedded in a cross-functional team alongside Product Managers, Engineers, and Operations specialists, enabling our rollout from tens of thousands to millions of smart meters.

This is a high-impact role for someone who loves solving messy data problems, automating manual workflows, and enabling decision-making through clean, reliable data pipelines.

Responsibilities


You will build and maintain core datasets that power our digital smart metering products and operational reporting
You will design, implement, and validate data models that support regulatory market communication, device operations, and forecasting models
You will analyze data quality, detect anomalies, and propose improvements to our metering and backend processes
You will support PMs with ad-hoc analysis, business case modelling, and KPI tracking; and you will work closely with engineering and data platform teams to define and improve data interfaces (e.g. APIs, ETL pipelines)
You will ensure data consistency and lineage across multiple systems
You will develop dashboards and self-service tools for internal users
You will translate regulatory requirements into data logic that can be operationalized and audited



Qualifications


You have at least 2 years of hands-on experience in data analysis or analytics engineering, ideally in an infrastructure-heavy or regulated environment.
You bring hands-on experience with SQL and large, complex datasets, including raw time series data. You know how to clean and transform data into actionable insights, and have built dashboards and reports using BI tools (Tableau, Metabase, or Power BI).
Familiarity with Python, Snowflake, dbt, or data modeling concepts (e.g., dimensional modeling, staging layers) is a nice-to-have, as is experience with energy market data flows or smart metering.
You communicate clearly in English. Knowledge of German is a plus.
You enjoy working in agile, cross-functional teams and take ownership beyond writing queries, contributing to the design and improvement of data systems as a whole.
