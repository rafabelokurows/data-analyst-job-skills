The best of your adventures is the one you have yet to sail!




Your Purpose

MSC Cruises, the world’s third-largest and fastest-growing cruise line brand, is expanding its Onboard Revenue team in the USA. Reporting to the Vice President of Onboard Revenue – U.S. Commercial, the Data Analyst will play a foundational role in owning reporting, automating insights, and laying the groundwork for a high-impact data function focused on categories like beverage, Wi-Fi, spa, and shore excursions.




This is a hybrid position requiring 3 days per week in the office, in Miami.




Position Overview

We are looking for a builder—not just someone who runs reports or polishes dashboards and decks, but someone who can connect dots, surface insights, and shape the systems that drive growth. As the first dedicated data hire for the U.S. Onboard Revenue team, you will design and own our reporting infrastructure, connect disparate data systems, and generate actionable insights that help maximize guest satisfaction and revenue. You’ll partner closely with the VP and cross-functional teams to bring clarity to performance, automate the basics, and unlock the next level of growth across onboard categories. You’ll also help shape how we integrate AI and predictive analytics as our systems evolve.




This role is ideal for someone with strong analytical chops, technical fluency, and a bias for execution. If you love organizing complexity, automating the painful stuff, and turning insights into impact—this role is for you.




Your Impact

Lead performance analysis across all major onboard revenue categories (e.g., beverage, Wi-Fi, shore excursions, spa), surfacing trends, KPIs, and actionable insights for the commercial team.
Collaborate with the BI team and the Geneva commercial OBR team to prioritize data and reporting needs; help define requirements for dashboards and pipelines that integrate ecommerce, CRM, POS, and guest behavior data.
Ensure data quality and trust, working closely with global and local teams to validate sources, definitions, and integrity.
Shape and enhance self-serve reporting tools (e.g., Power BI, Looker) by providing input on design, usability, and business logic; partner with BI to test and iterate dashboards.
Identify insights and performance drivers—not just what happened, but why it happened, and what we can do about it.
Design scalable, repeatable analytics processes, including automation of recurring reports, alerts, and executive summaries.
Collaborate with Geneva HQ to understand existing data structures and define what North America needs to move faster.
Support experimentation and A/B testing, working with category leads to evaluate impact and guide decision-making.
Help shape future analytics capabilities by identifying data and tooling needs for emerging use cases like personalization, attach rate optimization, and pricing experimentation.




Your Journey so far

Bachelor’s or Master’s Degree in Data Science, Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, or related field.
3–6 years of experience in data analytics, with at least 2 years owning dashboards and reporting in a business setting.
Proficiency in SQL and Python; experience with data wrangling, analysis, and light scripting.
Experience with cloud data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery).
Familiarity with dashboarding tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Looker).
Strong communication skills—able to explain data clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
Ability to work independently, prioritize ruthlessly, and move fast with limited oversight.
Experience working with ecommerce, revenue, or consumer-facing data preferred.
Fluent in English (additional languages beneficial).
Willingness to travel occasionally to corporate headquarters in Geneva and to operational locations, as needed.
