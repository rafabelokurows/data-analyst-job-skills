Money, it's a big problem for many. Our mission is to give everyone access to a richer life, helping everyone to enjoy a happier, healthier relationship with money. We've already helped over a million people by giving them the tools they need to achieve their goals, feel good and do a little better — from building their credit scores to growing their savings, to just understanding how it all works. Rapid experimentation to find what works, and learn as much as we can, is at the heart of our growth story.




What you'll do

Play a role in continuous improvement by identifying trends, patterns, and opportunities for further optimisation
Find the “so what?” in the results, and highlight what we could seek to learn or ask next.
Provide high quality monitoring and reporting on the performance of campaigns and experiments
Work closely with squads to formulate testable hypotheses that are based on insights derived from your data analysis.
Support the wider data team to answer the big questions that feed into company strategy.




Who you are

You are motivated by a love of your work and a connection to the mission of the business.
You are a strong collaborator, communicator and team player, with experience of leveraging the skills and knowledge around you in the wider business to find the answer.
You have good presentation skills, and enjoy sharing what you’ve found in a way that’s easy to understand.
You are full of curiosity and passionate about continuous learning, especially when it comes to tools and trends that allow you to make an impact with data.
You have a grasp of statistical methods and their practical application, such as significance testing or linear regression.
You have some experience using SQL and you are excited about developing your technical skills. It’s a bonus if you have used Python or R for data manipulation and analysis.
You relentlessly look beyond the data to find the “so what?” in the analysis.
You have experience working in fast-paced teams where ideas flow freely from everyone.

Contract: 1-year fixed term, full time (open to flexible and hybrid working, with regular travel to London and Practices across England)

Location: UK-based; regular travel to Coram Campus, London WC1N 1AZ, and across England

Reporting to: Learning & Insight Lead

Start date: ASAP




We’re looking for a Data Analyst to drive exceptional outcomes for children, break cycles of crime, and ignite system change.




Launched in 2020, SHiFT exists to break the destructive cycle for children and young people (up to 25) caught up in or at risk of crime. We work intensively with those for whom things are getting worse, not better, offering therapeutic, relationship-focused support.

We hope this pack, together with our website (shiftuk.org), helps you understand our mission and the skills we’re looking for. For questions, please email Ella Armstrong (Learning & Insights Lead) at ella.armstrong@shiftuk.org.




Apply by 23:59 on 21 July 2025 by sending:

A short covering letter (max 2 sides of A4) addressed to Ella Armstrong via info@shiftuk.org, outlining your experience and suitability.
A CV, including details of two referees (references won’t be taken up without your permission).
Details of your current notice period.
Our Equality & Diversity Monitoring Form [here].

Key dates:

Shortlisting notifications: 22 July 2025
Staff panel interviews (values-based, virtual): 29 July 2025
Second round (competency-based): 5 or 7 August 2025
A data task will also be part of the process.




The role




SHiFT is an ambitious, fast-growing organisation focused on evidence and impact. Our Learning Team has laid strong data foundations — now we need a Data Analyst to help us deepen our learning culture, support our Voice, Participation & Belonging strategy, and clearly show our impact at practice and systems-change levels.




This new role is perfect for someone looking to step up in data management, training, and insights work. You’ll streamline processes, support accurate data collection, and maximise insights from our custom Salesforce system.




You'll work closely with Practice Coordinators and the wider SHiFT team, so relationship-building, collaboration, and a problem-solving mindset are essential. You’ll have a sharp eye for detail, a ‘can do’ attitude, and the drive to help us improve as we grow.

While strong quantitative skills are essential, we welcome candidates without prior qualitative research experience — we can provide training in qualitative methods (e.g., interviews, focus groups).




If you enjoy making data fun and accessible, love working with non-technical colleagues, and want to use data to drive social change, we want to hear from you.




Equality and diversity




SHiFT is committed to eradicating discrimination based on race, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, pregnancy, age, marital status, or socio-economic circumstances. We actively encourage applications from candidates with diverse ethnic backgrounds, particularly because of the over-representation of Black, Brown, and Mixed Heritage children in the youth justice system.




Responsibilities




Data collection & management

Support accurate use of our Salesforce system across Practices.
Assist Practice Teams with data queries and surveys.
Coordinate and quality-check monthly submissions.
Develop reporting tools and dashboards that embed learning and demonstrate impact.

System improvement & efficiency

Identify and implement process improvements.
Contribute to Salesforce development with internal and external partners.
Support training materials and reduce data entry duplication.

Learning & insight generation

Produce routine reports and data summaries.
Use data to support reflection, learning, and system change.
Contribute to exploring data integration across social care, education, justice, and health.




You will bring




Beliefs & alignment
Belief that all people can change and relationships can drive that change.
Commitment to supporting young people to stop offending and contribute positively.
Alignment to SHiFT’s values: ambition, courage, flexibility, tenacity.
Comfort challenging the status quo to raise standards.
Determination, curiosity, and a commitment to continuous learning.
Experience & skills (essential)
Degree-level (or equivalent experience) in a relevant field (e.g., research, sociology, criminology, policy).
Strong data management and analysis skills (Excel, Power BI, ideally Salesforce).
Experience with data entry, cleaning, and quality assurance.
Experience in data visualisation and dashboard design.
Knowledge of GDPR and ethical data practices, including anonymisation.
Evidence of using data for meaningful insights and change.
Anti-racist and anti-oppressive practice commitment.
Strong communication skills, able to work with non-analytical colleagues and translate requirements into analysis.
Passion for organisational learning and data literacy.
