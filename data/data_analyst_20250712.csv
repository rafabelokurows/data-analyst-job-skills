As a Product Analyst, you will have the opportunity to develop, test, launch and scale member banking experience products. Through experimentation, user behavioral analysis, sophisticated statistical and data science modeling, and dashboards development, you will surface product insights and recommendations that will increase adoption, engagement, and retention of our members.

In this role, you will work closely with product managers, user research, engineers, product & lifecycle marketing, and operational stakeholders to foster a data-driven product development culture, advise our product roadmaps, and build a deep understanding of member behavior.

Keep a pulse on performance metrics and KPIs. You will be positioned to have a view of the business, product, and member base and encouraged to understand and explain trends.
Foster a data-driven, test-and-learn culture with your passion for telling stories with data - not only surfacing insights but also presenting those insights and recommendations to encourage and inspire change.
Partner widely with product, engineering, research, and design to translate your insights to guide product development. You’ll use data to help the organization understand how members are interacting with Chime and convert that to business and experience implications.
Lead experimentation by providing mentorship on how they should be run, defining success metrics and data requirements, evaluating impact, and providing strategic direction.
Advise roadmap, analysis and metric ideation, and strategic discussions with stakeholders.
Collaborate with analysts and other functions to help bridge business questions and technical (data / computational) solutions.


To thrive in this role, you have


4+ years in data-focused roles (post-internship), building analytical infrastructure and data tools that support a wide audience and facilitate decisions of trade-offs. B2C product analytics and FinTech experience preferred.
Expertise in SQL - you innately translate business questions to queries, understand the edge cases of joins, and can explore a warehouse to find data most appropriate to the problem.
Familiarity in R or python - you write reproducible code and have a tendency toward automation.
Experience leading experimentation, statistical analysis, and sophisticated measurement (e.g. causal inference) E2E to guide decision making.
Hands-on experience with BI/Visualization tools (Looker, Tableau, PowerBI, etc).
Experience building metric frameworks to understand user behaviors.
Ability to think holistically to solve business problems at hand and navigate through ambiguity.
Excellent stakeholder managements skills, with a record of working cross-functionally to achieve results.
A focus on impact - you don’t stop with just recommendations but ensure to see work through to changing the business.
