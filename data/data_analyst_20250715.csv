Your Challenge

As a Data Analyst in our Product Analytics team, you will play a key role in shaping data-informed decision-making across multiple mission teams.

Partnering with Product Managers, Engineers, Designers, and other cross-functional stakeholders, you will use data to uncover insights about user behavior across both our customer-facing products and internal tools.

Your Responsibilities


Analyze user behavior and product usage to uncover trends, pain points, and opportunities.
Define and track key product metrics to measure feature performance and business impact.
Translate complex data into clear, compelling narratives and share insights with a range of stakeholders.
Build dashboards to enable self-serve analytics across the organization, and also up-skill your stakeholders.
Collaborate with the Analytics Engineering to improve our data sources and self-serve solution.


Your Profile


2+ years of experience in a data analytics role, ideally within a product or tech environment
Ability to translate complex data into clear insights and actionable recommendations.
Good communication skills and ability to work with stakeholders across all levels.
Excellent SQL skills.
Experience with data visualization and reporting tools (e.g. Looker, Mixpanel, Tableau).
Keen interest in AI’s potential, paired with hands-on experimentation and solid conceptual understanding of generative-AI tools.


Nice To Have


Experience with A/B testing and Python are plus.
Data modelling and dbt knowledge are a plus.


Why Taxfix?


A chance to do meaningful, people-centric work with an international team of passionate professionals.
Holistic well-being with free mental health coaching sessions and yoga.
A monthly allowance to spend on an extensive range of services that you can use and roll over as flexibly as you like.
Employee stock options for all employees—because everyone deserves to benefit from the success they help to create.
30 annual vacation days and flexible working hours.
A generous learning budget to support your personal and professional development and guidance from our internal L&D experts.
Work from abroad for up to six weeks every year. Just align with your team, and then enjoy your trip.
Plenty of opportunities to socialise as a team. In addition to internal tech meetups, our international team hosts regular get-togethers—virtually and in person when possible.
Free tax declaration filing, of course, through the Taxfix app—and internal support for all personal tax-related questions.
Have a four-legged friend in your life? We’re happy to have dogs join us in the office.

As a Senior Data Analyst in the Size & Fit team, you will play a key role in addressing the challenge of finding the right fit in online shopping. Our mission involves gaining a deep understanding of customers’ preferences related to size and fit, as well as a comprehensive knowledge of the assortment attributes and measurements from our brands. The real magic happens when we successfully match both.

You will measure and analyze how the solutions we provide to our customers are impacting our business, and your insights will enable strategic commercial decisions at Zalando. Would you like to bring in your skills to shape a great experience for millions of customers when buying clothes online?

Bring your business data-driven analytical approach to the Size & Fit Team; you generate hypotheses and try to test them by performing descriptive, exploratory, and quantitative analyses. You can translate metrics from algorithmic and data products into actionable business insights. You know when a hypothesis can only be tested by an experiment, and you can help create and drive them.
You are the connector between the Applied Science team and the Product team. You can translate the Size and Fit benefits to answer complex business questions and identify and measure commercial opportunities.
Be a reliable partner for the Size & Fit Team when related to commercial reporting and analytics, and support the Team with more complex analysis.
Avoid working in silos by collaborating with cross-functional leaders from Applied Science, Product, Content and Customer Analytics to drive innovation. You incorporate data from different sources within and outside of Zalando to drive projects.

Your work will have a direct impact on how we attract and retain customers, creating data-driven, personalized interactions that keep them coming back. As part of our Consumer Team, you’ll enhance customer satisfaction and drive global growth and profitability through innovative projects.

The Consumer Product Analytics Team drives product strategy and innovation by providing actionable insights on customers and products, contributing to business success. In this role, you'll have the opportunity to shape the experience for millions of users across our worldwide portfolio of platforms (FoodPanda, Pedidos Ya, Woowa, Yemeksepeti, Foodora, Talabat, HungerStation, eFood, and Glovo), directly impacting customer satisfaction and driving growth. Our diverse team of data professionals is based in Berlin, working closely with product directors, product managers, engineers, and business stakeholders to directly influence product direction. We collaborate with a larger data team, including data engineers, data scientists, and ML engineers, to share knowledge and expertise.

At Consumer Product Analytics, you will have the opportunity to access high volume, rich user behavior data, engage in end to end product development cycles, work on complex product problems, and learn from many experienced data professionals.

The main responsibilities of the Product Analytics Team include:


Strategic Impact & Product Leadership: Act as a key strategic data partner to product leadership, influencing product roadmap and investment decisions through deep analytical insights and foresight. Proactively identify high-impact analytical opportunities to drive significant customer satisfaction and business growth.

Proactively identify and resolve data quality issues at scale.
Scalable ETL & Reporting Solutions: Design, build, and maintain robust data pipelines and self-service dashboards, ensuring data accessibility and empowering product teams to make data-driven decisions independently.
Deep Dive & Exploratory Analysis: Conduct complex, end-to-end exploratory analyses on large-scale user behavior data (transactional, clickstream, etc.) to uncover non-obvious insights, identify root causes of trends, and directly inform product strategy and roadmap development.
Technical & Mentorship Leadership: Contribute significantly to the growth and development of fellow product analysts through knowledge sharing sessions, best practice dissemination, workflow optimizations, and active participation in hiring and onboarding processes. Champion and drive analytical excellence within the team and broader organization.


Qualifications


9+ years of experience in product analytics or a related data-focused role, preferably within rapidly growing and dynamic environments, and with a broad mission scope or multiple stakeholders.
Expert proficiency in SQL and Python for complex data manipulation, analysis, and modeling. Experience with BigQuery and large-scale cloud data warehousing concepts is a strong plus.
Expertise in statistical methods applied to experimental design (A/B testing, multivariate tests, etc.), causal inference, and robust hypothesis validation. You should be able to navigate complex statistical challenges and explain methodologies clearly.
Extensive experience working with large-scale user behavior data (e.g., transactional, clickstream, app usage), including data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to derive actionable insights.
Proficiency with at least one data visualization tool such as Looker Studio (Data Studio), Tableau, QlikView, or Power BI, with a proven ability to create compelling and insightful dashboards.
Demonstrated ability to influence and collaborate with multiple stakeholders, including senior product managers, engineers, and business leaders. You can clearly communicate complex analytical findings and successfully drive large-scale analytics projects end-to-end (e.g., defining success metrics for a tribe, standardizing measurement across brands, or implementing new experimentation methodologies).
Experience with customer behavior tracking platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, MixPanel, Snowplow, Segment, Tealium).


Nice to have:


Experience with Airflow, DBT, or other data pipelining tools

Our product offers them a smart accounting tool to save time in their daily activities. As a company, we aim for excellence, continuously expand our horizons, and strive for daily improvement of our product and our daily work life. In pursuit of these goals, we rely on our strong culture, innovative spirit, and unwavering passion. In the future, we hope to count you among our dedicated team members

Your role

As our (Senior) Marketing  Data Analyst, you’ll sit in our marketing team, be part of our Data Circle, and partner daily with Growth, Brand, and Finance. Your mission: build a measurement engine that shows why campaigns and channels work, where to invest next, and how to maximise customer acquisition and revenue.

Here’s How You’ll Make An Impact


Drive advanced analytics setups - Build and automate Looker dashboards that surface trends and anomalies for Growth, Brand, and execs and keep performance reporting always on and decision ready.
Own and evolve the marketing measurement framework – triangulate MMM, MTA, and incremental testing to create a single source of truth for spend efficiency and ROI.
Lead additional data projects – from lead quality scoring to revenue forecasting models, you’ll scope, prototype, and ship projects and analyses that deliver measurable impact.
Champion a culture of experimentation – set statistical guardrails for A/B tests, run posttest analysis, and translate results into next step recommendations.
Monitor data quality (tracking, taxonomy, attribution) and partner with Data Engineering to keep our Snowflake warehouse and dbt models spotless.
Turn complex findings into crisp, compelling stories that influence roadmaps and budget decisions.


Your Qualifications


5+ years as a marketing, growth, or product data analyst (SaaS experience is a plus).
Expert SQL skills; handson with Looker, or similar BI tools; comfortable inside Snowflake.
Strong understanding of statistics, especially significance testing and causal inference for A/B and multivariate experiments.
Successful implementation of marketing measurement frameworks and advanced analytics setups.
Deep knowledge of MMM, MTA, and incremental testing methodologies.
Proven track record rolling out a marketing measurement framework and advanced analytics stack (MMM + MTA + incrementality) end to end would be a plus.
Solid base in data science concepts (Python or R for modelling and automation, version control, orchestration tools).
With excellent written and verbal communication (German C1 & English C1) you communicate data-driven insights clearly to both technical and nontechnical stakeholders.


Our tech stack:

Snowflake | dbt | Snowplow | Looker | Metabase | Mixpanel

Job Requirements

Your sevdesk Experience

Drive Impact: Make meaningful contributions and help move initiatives forward across teams. Your input will be valued, and your work will have a direct influence on sevdesk's success.

Empowered Ownership: take charge of your work and projects with the expectation of making decisions independently, supported by a team that's there when you need guidance.

Competitive Compensation: Includes a stock option plan and company pension to reward your contributions.

Time to Recharge: 30 vacation days, 3 additional days for social engagement, plus 30 Workation days to work from anywhere in the EU.

Flexible Work Environment: We believe in working where you’re most productive, whether that’s at home or in the office. Our hybrid approach balances flexibility with in-person collaboration, fostering trust and strong teamwork when we come together.

Comprehensive Benefits: bike leasing, monthly voucher of choice (Amazon, IKEA, Car Sharing, …), Amazon book flat, corporate discounts and more.

Team Vibes: Enjoy regular team offsites and quarterly events packed with networking and fun!

Money, it's a big problem for many. Our mission is to give everyone access to a richer life, helping everyone to enjoy a happier, healthier relationship with money. We've already helped over a million people by giving them the tools they need to achieve their goals, feel good and do a little better — from building their credit scores to growing their savings, to just understanding how it all works. Rapid experimentation to find what works, and learn as much as we can, is at the heart of our growth story.




What you'll do




As a Data Analyst, you know that it’s not just about the data we have, but what we do with it that counts. In this key role within the data team, you will use your analytical and critical skills to shape our commercial strategy while helping to scale and strengthen our team. You'll transform complex business problems into questions, insights and actions that will underpin decisions across business units. You’ll also collaborate cross-functionally with marketing, product, engineering and finance teams to improve customer engagement and maximise our revenue.




You will:

Play a role in continuous improvement by identifying trends, patterns, and opportunities for further optimisation
Find the “so what?” in the results, and highlight what we could seek to learn or ask next.
Provide high quality monitoring and reporting on the performance of campaigns and experiments
Work closely with squads to formulate testable hypotheses that are based on insights derived from your data analysis.
Support the wider data team to answer the big questions that feed into company strategy.




Who you are

You are motivated by a love of your work and a connection to the mission of the business.
You are a strong collaborator, communicator and team player, with experience of leveraging the skills and knowledge around you in the wider business to find the answer.
You have good presentation skills, and enjoy sharing what you’ve found in a way that’s easy to understand.
You are full of curiosity and passionate about continuous learning, especially when it comes to tools and trends that allow you to make an impact with data.
You have a grasp of statistical methods and their practical application, such as significance testing or linear regression.
You have some experience using SQL and you are excited about developing your technical skills. It’s a bonus if you have used Python or R for data manipulation and analysis.
You relentlessly look beyond the data to find the “so what?” in the analysis.
You have experience working in fast-paced teams where ideas flow freely from everyone.

Competitive salary - based on your level of experience
Annual bonus
£500 richer life fund
25 days holiday plus bank holidays, a day off in your birthday month, variable Christmas closure

Exposure to tools like Xero, Airbank, Shopify, or equivalent platforms
Bonus: experience with forecasting models or financial scenario planning
Strong attention to detail, with a bias toward automation and clarity

Continuously improve tracking accuracy, analytics workflows, and campaign tagging processes


What you bring to the table:


2-4 years of experience in a data analyst or digital analytics role
Proficiency in Google Analytics (GA4), GTM, Power BI, and strong Excel/Sheets knowledge
Experience working with websites and CMS platforms, with an understanding of front-end code (HTML, CSS, JS) a plus

Job Description

The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) enriches the environment and protects public health for all New Yorkers by providing 1.1 billion gallons of high quality drinking water, managing wastewater and stormwater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution. DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees. DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the system’s 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.

New York City has approximately 140,000 catch basins, 114,000 hydrants, 90,000 valves, 14 gatehouses, 3 reservoirs, 68 groundwater wells, a 100 million gallon underground storage tank and 7,000 miles each of both sanitary sewers and water mains. The responsibility of maintaining these vast networks falls under the Department of Environmental Protection’s Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations (BWSO).

The primary responsibilities of the Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations are: the operation, maintenance and protection of the City’s drinking water and wastewater collection (sewer) systems; the protection of adjacent waterways; and the development and protection of the Department’s Capital Water and Sewer Design Program. The Bureau also approves and inspects water and sewer connections performed by licensed plumbers and/or authorized contractors. In addition, the Bureau has overall responsibility for the approval and inspection of all public and private construction projects which could impact on the City’s water or sewer systems.

The Bureau is also responsible for the operation of the Staten Island Bluebelt. This is an ecologically sound, cost effective natural alternative to storm sewers, which occupies approximately 15 square miles of land in the South Richmond area of Staten Island. This project preserves streams, ponds and other wetland (""bluebelt"") areas, allowing them to perform their natural function of conveying, storing and filtering storm water. These areas also provide important community open spaces and a diverse wildlife habitat.

Within the Capital Program Management (CPM) Team, the Chief of Strategic Planning is seeking a Data Analyst to manage budgeting work, analyze data for strategic planning, and for project delivery processes, assess data management needs. The Data Analyst will prepare and track capital budget plans and project delivery status through extensive coordination with internal and external stakeholders. Responsibilities include identifying and tracking variances between planned and actual expenditures, and comparing current and future project budgets against previous budget plans. This role calls for the analysis, identification, and reporting of data gaps and needs for the development of a capital investment management strategy. The Data Analyst will work closely with BWSO’s Operations Analysis & Regulatory Compliance group to ultimately develop and manage a coordinated data flow to increase the efficiency of capital planning workflow processes.

Demonstrated experience as a Data Analyst, preferably within the fintech industry, with a strong focus on crypto trading, payments, and brokerage services.
Proficiency in data analysis tools and programming languages such as SQL, Python, and R, along with proficiency in data visualization software (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).
Strong analytical skills and problem-solving capabilities, with a proven ability to convert complex data into actionable business insights.
Experience with creating business intelligence reports and ad-hoc analyses tailored to meet diverse client and regulatory requirements.
Experience working in Agile environments.
Proven ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams, including product management, engineering, and support.

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-

However, depending on business needs, you may be required to work year-round, potentially at a different location during break periods. Business needs may vary from year to year.
