Additionally, you will establish governance policies and procedures to ensure data integrity, compliance, and security within the BI platform.
Data Modeling and Transformation - You will make a significant impact by designing and implementing data models that support PowerBI and SSRS reporting needs, ensuring efficient data retrieval and analysis. You'll also support and maintain ETL processes that ensure data quality, consistency, and performance across our reporting infrastructure.
PowerBI Training and Adoption Advocate - You will engage with all levels and functions across the organization. You will conduct training sessions and workshops for internal stakeholders and citizen developers, focusing on PowerBI usage, best practices, and advanced features.
Collaboration with Internal Customers - You will stay close to the action by working closely with internal customers to gather reporting requirements, understand business needs, and prioritize development efforts.

Having fun in an environment high on transparency, open to innovative new approaches with a supportive family feel

For the past 5 years, Sugar Mountain’s company culture has been recognized as a Great Place to Work.

• Provide proactive insights into business challenges and opportunities, going beyond standard reporting to highlight emerging trends, risks, and areas for improvement.




Education & Experience:

• Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems, Data Analytics, Animal Science, or a related field, or equivalent industry experience with a proven track record of success; accounting or financial acumen is a plus.

• Minimum of two years of experience in business intelligence, data analytics, or related roles; experience in livestock, agriculture, or process manufacturing is strongly preferred.

• Hands-on experience with ERP, BI, and ETL platforms (e.g., Business Central, DOMO, Power BI, SQL, or modern cloud data warehouses), along with a solid understanding of data governance best practices.

• Demonstrated ability to translate business needs into scalable data products and clear KPIs that drive operational improvements.

• Strong analytical, communication, and project coordination skills, with the ability to manage multiple requests and deliver results on time.

• A curious, proactive learner with a detail-oriented mindset, eager to contribute in a dynamic, cross-functional environment.

• Comfortable collaborating with external experts on advanced analytics or data science tasks; deep machine learning expertise is a plus.

Want to be part of a high-performing team driving scalable solutions at the intersection of technology and operations? We’re looking for platform experts who thrive on structure, strategy, and solving.




We’re looking for a Social Listening & Insights Analyst who brings more than just monitoring skills—you bring the ability to uncover meaningful insights from complex social data and connect them to the bigger picture. Working within a large matrixed tech environment, you’ll help transform how we use social listening to inform business and marketing decisions across priority customer solution areas (CSAs).




As our Social Listening and Insights Analyst, you’ll support both planned and ad hoc reporting, contributing to a stronger insights-driven culture. This role is ideal for someone who’s both analytical and curious, with the drive to not just report on trends—but to ask better questions, spot patterns, and tell stories with data that shape strategy.




This person would join the Designit team that supports Microsoft Cloud Marketing, Blog, and Social. This world-class social team operates 100+ social media channels and 20+ marketing blogs designed for developers, IT decision makers, IT implementers, and business decision makers. Each month, we publish over 3,000 posts to help, inform, entertain, and engage across the globe. Azure, Power BI, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 are just a few examples of the innovative products and services that comprise the ecosystem.




What You’ll Do

Own and deliver recurring and ad hoc social listening reports across CSAs, tailored to specific campaign, brand, or business priorities.
Translate social data into clear, actionable insights that drive decisions—beyond just volume metrics.
Provide point-in-time analysis during key launches, events, or spikes in conversation.
Surface sentiment trends, audience behaviors, competitor comparisons, and whitespace opportunities.
Partner closely with social media managers, strategists, and ops leads to align reporting with campaign and business objectives.
Act as a thought partner—not just a report generator—by proactively identifying insight opportunities and storylines.
Help evolve our reporting frameworks, storytelling formats, and listening taxonomies over time.
Stay current on industry tools, best practices, and emerging technologies in the listening and analytics space.




What you bring:

3–5+ years of experience in social listening, digital analytics, or insights—ideally in agency, tech, or global brand settings.
Hands-on expertise with social listening tools (Sprinklr highly preferred, or others like Talkwalker, Brandwatch, NetBase, etc.).
Strong data analysis and synthesis skills; comfort with interpreting both quantitative and qualitative social data.
Ability to craft clear insights and deliver them in visually engaging and executive-friendly ways.
A sense of curiosity—asking “why” behind the data and seeking broader patterns or implications.
Experience working across multiple stakeholders and managing multiple requests at once in a fast-paced environment.
Solid understanding of the social landscape—platform nuances, content formats, and conversation patterns.
Bonus: familiarity with tagging structures, taxonomy building, or integration with broader research teams.




Why This Role Is Exciting

Social data has never been more valuable—but it’s only as powerful as the insights we draw from it. In this role, you’ll help elevate the way our team listens, understands, and acts on what our audiences are saying.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Working remotely at Stripe

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

The world’s leading organizations trust CyberArk to help secure their most critical assets. To learn more about CyberArk, visit our CyberArk blogs or follow us on X, LinkedIn or Facebook.

Job Description

CyberArk is seeking a Senior Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst with a passion for sales strategy and business insight to join our Business Analytics team. In this role, you will act as a strategic partner to Sales and Sales Operations leaders around the globe—translating data into compelling narratives that drive better, faster decisions. You’ll play a key role in shaping how performance is measured, understood, and improved across our global go-to-market (GTM) organization. While you’ll contribute to dashboard development and scalable reporting in Tableau, this role goes far beyond building reports—you’ll be expected to uncover trends, connect dots across complex datasets, and communicate insights in a way that resonates with non-technical audiences. The ideal candidate is a business-minded analyst with strong sales acumen, excellent communication skills, and an instinct for asking the right questions to get to the heart of the problem.

Responsibilities:



Serve as an embedded analytics partner to global Sales and Sales Operations stakeholders, proactively identifying opportunities to improve pipeline, productivity, and conversion
Craft clear, executive-ready narratives based on deep-dive analyses of sales performance, pipeline coverage, segmentation, and revenue trends
Translate complex data and technical concepts into actionable recommendations that are easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand and act upon
Design and evolve self-service dashboards and tools in Tableau that reduce friction and enable faster time-to-decision
Maintain a high bar for data accuracy and consistency across reports and ad hoc deliverables
Collaborate cross-functionally with Sales, RevOps, Marketing, Finance, and IT to align on business definitions and ensure reliable analytics infrastructure
Help drive a data-driven culture by enabling stakeholders to interpret KPIs and use insights effectively



Qualifications



4–6 years of experience in Sales Analytics, Sales Operations, Business Intelligence, or a related field
Proven ability to extract and communicate insights from complex data—especially in a Sales or GTM environment
Strong business judgment, with experience working directly with senior stakeholders and cross-functional teams
Working knowledge of SQL and experience with Tableau or a similar BI platform (depth of tool expertise less important than the ability to learn quickly)
Understanding of B2B sales metrics, pipeline stages, and CRM data (Salesforce experience a plus)
Excellent storytelling skills—both written and verbal—with the ability to tailor messages to executive and frontline audiences
Self-starter who thrives in a fast-paced, dynamic environment and isn’t afraid to ask questions or challenge assumptions
Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative or business-related field
Smart, bold but humble attitude to work collaboratively with CyberArk colleagues



Additional Information

CyberArk is an Equal Opportunity Employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or protected Veteran status.

We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of employment Visa at this time.

The salary range for this position is $87,000 – $121,000/year, plus commissions or discretionary bonus, which will be based on the employee’s performance.
