About us:

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The best choice for anyone who takes investing seriously:

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

Job Description

We are on the lookout for a Staff Product Analyst to join the Consumer Product Analytics team on our journey to always deliver amazing experiences.

At Delivery Hero, you’ll shape the global consumer experience for millions of users. Your work will have a direct impact on how we attract and retain customers, creating data-driven, personalized interactions that keep them coming back. As part of our Consumer Team, you’ll enhance customer satisfaction and drive global growth and profitability through innovative projects.

The Consumer Product Analytics Team drives product strategy and innovation by providing actionable insights on customers and products, contributing to business success. In this role, you'll have the opportunity to shape the experience for millions of users across our worldwide portfolio of platforms (FoodPanda, Pedidos Ya, Woowa, Yemeksepeti, Foodora, Talabat, HungerStation, eFood, and Glovo), directly impacting customer satisfaction and driving growth. Our diverse team of data professionals is based in Berlin, working closely with product directors, product managers, engineers, and business stakeholders to directly influence product direction. We collaborate with a larger data team, including data engineers, data scientists, and ML engineers, to share knowledge and expertise.

At Consumer Product Analytics, you will have the opportunity to access high volume, rich user behavior data, engage in end to end product development cycles, work on complex product problems, and learn from many experienced data professionals.

The main responsibilities of the Product Analytics Team include:


Strategic Impact & Product Leadership: Act as a key strategic data partner to product leadership, influencing product roadmap and investment decisions through deep analytical insights and foresight. Proactively identify high-impact analytical opportunities to drive significant customer satisfaction and business growth.
Advanced Experimentation & Causal Inference: Design, implement, and rigorously analyze A/B tests and other experimental designs (e.g., multi-variate, quasi-experiments) with a strong emphasis on advanced statistical methods for robust hypothesis validation, accurate impact measurement, and understanding causal relationships. Drive the standardization and continuous improvement of our experimentation framework across multiple brands.
Metric Framework & OKR Ownership: Define, establish, and own comprehensive product metric frameworks and quarterly OKRs. Drive alignment on ""what good looks like"" across product teams, ensuring clear, measurable goals that align with strategic business outcomes.
Data Integrity & Tracking Excellence: Take ownership of tracking definition and work closely with various Delivery Hero brands to significantly improve the reliability, consistency, and completeness of user behavior tracking for our discovery tools. Proactively identify and resolve data quality issues at scale.
Scalable ETL & Reporting Solutions: Design, build, and maintain robust data pipelines and self-service dashboards, ensuring data accessibility and empowering product teams to make data-driven decisions independently.
Deep Dive & Exploratory Analysis: Conduct complex, end-to-end exploratory analyses on large-scale user behavior data (transactional, clickstream, etc.) to uncover non-obvious insights, identify root causes of trends, and directly inform product strategy and roadmap development.
Technical & Mentorship Leadership: Contribute significantly to the growth and development of fellow product analysts through knowledge sharing sessions, best practice dissemination, workflow optimizations, and active participation in hiring and onboarding processes. Champion and drive analytical excellence within the team and broader organization.


Qualifications


9+ years of experience in product analytics or a related data-focused role, preferably within rapidly growing and dynamic environments, and with a broad mission scope or multiple stakeholders.
Expert proficiency in SQL and Python for complex data manipulation, analysis, and modeling. Experience with BigQuery and large-scale cloud data warehousing concepts is a strong plus.
Expertise in statistical methods applied to experimental design (A/B testing, multivariate tests, etc.), causal inference, and robust hypothesis validation. You should be able to navigate complex statistical challenges and explain methodologies clearly.
Extensive experience working with large-scale user behavior data (e.g., transactional, clickstream, app usage), including data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to derive actionable insights.
Proficiency with at least one data visualization tool such as Looker Studio (Data Studio), Tableau, QlikView, or Power BI, with a proven ability to create compelling and insightful dashboards.
Demonstrated ability to influence and collaborate with multiple stakeholders, including senior product managers, engineers, and business leaders. You can clearly communicate complex analytical findings and successfully drive large-scale analytics projects end-to-end (e.g., defining success metrics for a tribe, standardizing measurement across brands, or implementing new experimentation methodologies).
Experience with customer behavior tracking platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, MixPanel, Snowplow, Segment, Tealium).

About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

Join us as a (Senior) Data Analyst (m/f/d) in our MaaS Unit on a shared journey that matters!

As a (Senior) Data Analyst you'll work closely with product teams to foster and champion a truly data-informed culture.

You'll be the go-to person for analytical enablement across our Mobility as a Service (MaaS) unit making sure teams are empowered to work with data confidently and self sufficiently by facilitating knowledge sharing and establishing best practices across the unit.

As part of a cross-team initiative, you will own and maintain overarching business KPIs to support our management with steering our MOIA product.

What you will do


Be an Enabler!
Enable and coach teams to build and maintain their own dashboards and analytical solutions.
Develop tools and processes in sparring with our data and analytics engineers to further evolve our data foundation.
Train and upskill team members on data tools, SQL, and analytical best practices through workshops.
Be an Analyst!
Translate business and product questions into measurable KPIs and actionable insights.
Proactively propose and drive new analytical projects (e.g. deep dives, funnel analyses, adoption metrics).
Own and maintain key dashboards and reporting tools across the MaaS unit.
Be a Team Player!
Facilitate alignment between teams and central data hub for complex data modeling needs.
Act as a strategic sparring partner for product managers and senior stakeholders on analytical methodology.
Support teams during implementation through guidance, reviews, and pairing sessions.

What will help you to fulfill your role


You have a background in data or business analytics or similar domains such as analytics engineering or data science.
You're passionate about enablement and coaching and take pride in seeing teams grow their analytical capabilities and confidence.
You have experience translating business needs into meaningful data products and models, bridging the gap between raw data and actionable insights.
You are the first one to jump into stakeholder meetings, organizing workshops, reviews, or onboardings with our close colleagues.
You know the difference between a ""left join"" and ""inner join"", and don't faint when thinking about window calculations. Python is a big plus, but not a deal breaker if your knowledge is limited.
You have a favorite data graph (we personally love a good bar chart) and have worked with self service analytics tools like Quicksight, Tableau, PowerBI, Looker or similar.
You feel comfortable in a team with close communication circles, big appreciation for each other, and the occasional meme ping-pong. It's going to be fun - we promise.


We encourage you to apply even if your profile does not meet all the requirements for the role since we are looking for a diverse range of experiences, skills, and interests. We are certain that there will be something for everyone because we are working on such a variety of tasks and embrace individual growth at MOIA.

In case you have questions regarding your application, you can approach the recruiter Patty directly.

💼 £45,000–£55,000 + benefits | Hybrid – London




We’re working with a pioneering nuclear energy company that’s transforming how low-carbon power is designed, delivered, and scaled across the UK. As they continue to grow, they’re looking for a skilled and curious Data Analyst to help drive smarter decisions across engineering, operations, and strategy.




This isn’t your typical analyst role — it’s a chance to work at the intersection of energy, innovation, and impact. You’ll be turning complex datasets into meaningful insights that shape everything from reactor performance to long-term infrastructure planning.




Why This Role Stands Out

✔ Work on nationally significant clean energy projects

✔ Join a purpose-driven business at the cutting edge of nuclear technology

✔ Strong technical team with a collaborative, learning-focused culture

✔ Hybrid working with flexible hours and career development support




What You’ll Be Doing

Analysing operational and performance data from nuclear systems and infrastructure
Building dashboards, reports, and predictive models to inform business and engineering decisions
Working closely with engineers, scientists, and leadership teams to translate data into action
Supporting continuous improvement and regulatory reporting processes
Contributing to data strategy, governance, and tooling decisions as the team scales




What They’re Looking For

Strong experience in data analysis, ideally within engineering, energy, or regulated sectors
Proficient in SQL, Python (or R), and data visualisation tools like Power BI or Tableau
Comfortable working with complex datasets and extracting clear insights
Great communication skills — able to explain technical findings to non-technical stakeholders
Passionate about using data to contribute to a cleaner energy future




If you’re looking for a meaningful role where your analysis directly supports the UK’s path to net zero — this is it.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.

To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.


What we look for
Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.


What we offer
Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.


Commitment & contract
Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time or part-time.

Location
Milan (Italy), London (UK).

Before you apply
Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We're extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don't hesitate to apply.

          At Bending Spoons, we’re striving to build one of the all-time great companies. A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.<br><br>To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.<br><br>For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.<br><br><strong>A few examples of your responsibilities</strong><ul><li>Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.</li><li>Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.</li><li>Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.</li><li>Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.</li><li>Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.<br><br></li></ul><strong>What we look for</strong><ul><li><strong>Reasoning ability.</strong> Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.</li><li><strong>Drive.</strong> You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.</li><li><strong>Team spirit.</strong> You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.</li><li><strong>Proficiency in English.</strong> You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.<br><br></li></ul><strong>What we offer</strong><ul><li><strong>Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams.</strong> You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.</li><li><strong>An exceptional opportunity for growth.</strong> We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.</li><li><strong>Competitive pay and access to equity in the company.</strong> Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.</li><li><strong>All. These. Benefits.</strong> Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.<br><br></li></ul><strong>Commitment &amp; contract<br></strong>Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time or part-time.<br><br><strong>Location<br></strong>Milan (Italy), London (UK).<br><br><strong>Before you apply<br></strong>Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We're extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don't hesitate to apply.<br><br><strong>The selection process<br></strong>If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems.

Contract: 1-year fixed term, full time (open to flexible and hybrid working, with regular travel to London and Practices across England)

Location: UK-based; regular travel to Coram Campus, London WC1N 1AZ, and across England

Reporting to: Learning & Insight Lead

Start date: ASAP




We’re looking for a Data Analyst to drive exceptional outcomes for children, break cycles of crime, and ignite system change.




Launched in 2020, SHiFT exists to break the destructive cycle for children and young people (up to 25) caught up in or at risk of crime. We work intensively with those for whom things are getting worse, not better, offering therapeutic, relationship-focused support.

We hope this pack, together with our website (shiftuk.org), helps you understand our mission and the skills we’re looking for. For questions, please email Ella Armstrong (Learning & Insights Lead) at ella.armstrong@shiftuk.org.




Apply by 23:59 on 21 July 2025 by sending:

A short covering letter (max 2 sides of A4) addressed to Ella Armstrong via info@shiftuk.org, outlining your experience and suitability.
A CV, including details of two referees (references won’t be taken up without your permission).
Details of your current notice period.
Our Equality & Diversity Monitoring Form [here].

Key dates:

Shortlisting notifications: 22 July 2025
Staff panel interviews (values-based, virtual): 29 July 2025
Second round (competency-based): 5 or 7 August 2025
A data task will also be part of the process.




The role




SHiFT is an ambitious, fast-growing organisation focused on evidence and impact. Our Learning Team has laid strong data foundations — now we need a Data Analyst to help us deepen our learning culture, support our Voice, Participation & Belonging strategy, and clearly show our impact at practice and systems-change levels.




This new role is perfect for someone looking to step up in data management, training, and insights work. You’ll streamline processes, support accurate data collection, and maximise insights from our custom Salesforce system.




You'll work closely with Practice Coordinators and the wider SHiFT team, so relationship-building, collaboration, and a problem-solving mindset are essential. You’ll have a sharp eye for detail, a ‘can do’ attitude, and the drive to help us improve as we grow.

While strong quantitative skills are essential, we welcome candidates without prior qualitative research experience — we can provide training in qualitative methods (e.g., interviews, focus groups).




If you enjoy making data fun and accessible, love working with non-technical colleagues, and want to use data to drive social change, we want to hear from you.




Equality and diversity




SHiFT is committed to eradicating discrimination based on race, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, pregnancy, age, marital status, or socio-economic circumstances. We actively encourage applications from candidates with diverse ethnic backgrounds, particularly because of the over-representation of Black, Brown, and Mixed Heritage children in the youth justice system.




Responsibilities




Data collection & management

Support accurate use of our Salesforce system across Practices.
Assist Practice Teams with data queries and surveys.
Coordinate and quality-check monthly submissions.
Develop reporting tools and dashboards that embed learning and demonstrate impact.

System improvement & efficiency

Identify and implement process improvements.
Contribute to Salesforce development with internal and external partners.
Support training materials and reduce data entry duplication.

Learning & insight generation

Produce routine reports and data summaries.
Use data to support reflection, learning, and system change.
Contribute to exploring data integration across social care, education, justice, and health.




You will bring




Beliefs & alignment
Belief that all people can change and relationships can drive that change.
Commitment to supporting young people to stop offending and contribute positively.
Alignment to SHiFT’s values: ambition, courage, flexibility, tenacity.
Comfort challenging the status quo to raise standards.
Determination, curiosity, and a commitment to continuous learning.
Experience & skills (essential)
Degree-level (or equivalent experience) in a relevant field (e.g., research, sociology, criminology, policy).
Strong data management and analysis skills (Excel, Power BI, ideally Salesforce).
Experience with data entry, cleaning, and quality assurance.
Experience in data visualisation and dashboard design.
Knowledge of GDPR and ethical data practices, including anonymisation.
Evidence of using data for meaningful insights and change.
Anti-racist and anti-oppressive practice commitment.
Strong communication skills, able to work with non-analytical colleagues and translate requirements into analysis.
Passion for organisational learning and data literacy.
Desirable
Experience designing surveys, qualitative interviews, or creative data collection.
Excellent report writing and presentation skills.
Familiarity with social sector data (youth justice, education, social care).
Salesforce CRM experience.
Experience writing funding applications.




Additional requirements




Right to work in the UK.
Subject to DBS check.




Not sure you meet every requirement? We encourage you to apply even if you don’t match the description exactly. Tell us about your achievements, what you've learned, and how your passion and skills could contribute to SHiFT.




We look forward to hearing from you!

What We’re Looking For ✅


1–3 years of experience in a data, analytics, or finance-focused role (startup or high-growth background a plus)
Confident in SQL, spreadsheets, and turning raw data into usable insight
Familiarity with financial concepts—revenue recognition, margin, opex/capex
Exposure to tools like Xero, Airbank, Shopify, or equivalent platforms
Bonus: experience with forecasting models or financial scenario planning
Strong attention to detail, with a bias toward automation and clarity
Self-starter who’s excited by fast feedback loops and real commercial impact


Expected start date is August 15th or sooner

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements



Travel:-

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources
Define and monitor key economic impact metrics
Go deep on understanding business drivers, user segments, cohorts and macroeconomic trends
Prepare presentations, analyses and visualizations for internal and external executive audiences
Partner closely with Communications, Policy, Marketing and Product teams to identify and analyze key trends and produce thought leadership pieces and campaign content leveraging Stripe data
Collaborate with external vendors, academics, and think tanks to advance Stripe’s research agenda and advocacy positions



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About the workplace

The Vancity Analytics Centre of Excellence (ACE) is a force for change. Our mandate is simple - we leverage our data with actionable insights that help our leaders make stronger decisions. We use a deeply human approach - telling stories in the language of our stakeholders with a proactive and predictive lens. We don’t rely on complex charts; we focus on the ‘so what’ of every question and insight to deliver value. We work collaboratively with our colleagues to serve our members and our business.




This is a permanent, full-time role that will enjoy hybrid working arrangements which can be fulfilled primarily from the Vancity head office location and your Lower Mainland based home office. Periodically, you’ll be required to attend in-person activities or events.

Humanizing insights from data by crafting narratives with analysis and a clear ‘so what’ with measurable recommendations. You’ll support this output by building analytical models, hypothesis validation, evaluating results from test & learn experiments, and handling ad hoc analysis requests.
Resolving complex information needs and translating them into executable research and analytics initiatives.
Supporting the director in compiling and communicating research and analytics insights to enable the delivery of key business strategies and decisions.
Identifying emerging trends, risks and opportunities, assess implications, and make recommendations to management to mitigate potential risks and identify potential opportunities for the business.
Working closely with the Analytics Centre of Excellence and in collaboration with leaders, business stakeholders, consultants, and external agencies/data providers as needed. This role has significant exposure to the VP level.




You have:

Excellent analytical thinking capability, skilled at probing stakeholders to uncover business problems and translating these into analytical questions and summarizing insights to reach conclusion
Excellent communication skills. Strong ability to explain complicated ideas to broader audiences using non-technical language
Strong presentation skills, able to organize information and present analytical results in an efficient manner
Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Computer Science, Economics, Finance, or other quantitative fields
5-7 years of experience in analytics
Thorough working knowledge of relational databases and advanced SQL data extraction and manipulation tools (must have)
Proficiency with: R/Python, Power BI / Tableau. Working level statistical skills, including regression, time series, champion/challenger testing, and decision tree modeling
Ability to access complex data sources, explore data resources, clean and compile data to provide analytical driven solutions to real business problems
You are familiar with best practices in statistical methodologies and innovative analytical tools, and can leverage this knowledge to support our business stakeholders to make stronger decisions

Bonus points, if you have:

Experience in any of the following domains would be considered an asset: financial services/banking, credit cards/payments, credit risk, marketing campaigns, CRM, call center operations




You are:

Passionate about giving meaning to data
Someone who enjoys investigating complex problems, and making sense of information and thinking conceptually
Comfortable with ambiguity




We value lived experience, so if you are interested in this role, we encourage you to apply even if you feel your skills don't perfectly align with those listed.




The salary range for this role is $81,200 to $122,000 annually. Base pay offered may vary depending on factors such as relevant qualifications, skills, previous experience, and internal equity. As part of our total rewards package, employees may also be eligible for our annual incentive program, subject to program eligibility requirements.

The Position

Uplight is creating a new category of energy. We make software that manages energy resources in homes and businesses—including things like smart thermostats, electric vehicles, solar panels, storage batteries, heat pumps, and even people’s behavior—to generate, shift, or save energy to balance the grid, making it more efficient and reliable. This creates clean energy capacity that can be used by the power grid instead of burning more fossil fuels. Our solutions accelerate the transition to clean energy and save money for energy customers.

We are seeking a Data Engineer focusing on data platform enablement to support our mission and scale our impact

How You Will Make An Impact

As a Data Engineer at Uplight, you’ll play a central role in designing and maintaining the infrastructure that ingests, transforms, and delivers data across our platform. Your work ensures that data systems are reliable, scalable, observable, and cost-efficient—forming the backbone of many customer-facing and data science-driven solutions.

You’ll partner with cross-functional teams including analysts, product managers, and data scientists to ensure the platform meets the evolving needs of our business and our users.

What You Get To Do


Design, build, and maintain data pipelines using Databricks (Spark, Delta Lake) and Python.
Collaborate across teams to develop core platform capabilities—such as orchestration, metadata management, and data quality—delivering scalable, reusable solutions
Improve reliability and fault tolerance of ingest pipelines handling large volumes of utility data.
Build and support MLOps tooling, including data pipelines, model registries, and serving infrastructure
Participate in the full software development lifecycle: design, build, test, deploy, and support
Contribute to a remote-first team that values agility, collaboration, and clarity—favoring whiteboarding, async design docs, and reflective retros over rigid ceremonies.
Continuously learn and grow with support from senior engineers and team leads
Help maintain a team culture rooted in curiosity, empathy, and continuous improvement


What You Bring To Uplight


2–5 years of software engineering experience, ideally in backend or data-focused roles
Experience with Databricks, Spark, or similar big data technologies
Proficiency in Python and SQL
Exposure to cloud platforms such as GCP or AWS
Familiarity with CI/CD tools and infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Docker, Terraform, CircleCI)
Strong communication and collaboration skills; a team player excited to learn and grow


Bonus Points


Familiarity with MLOps concepts and tools (e.g., MLflow, model versioning)
Experience with real-time or streaming data systems (e.g., Kafka, Structured Streaming)
Understanding of data observability, lineage, and quality
Prior work in the energy or utility space
Strong grasp of Big Data challenges including cost vs performance tradeoffs


Don’t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women, marginalized genders and people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification. At Uplight we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.
