You'll help improve data quality, support ongoing data migration efforts, and bring technical expertise in SQL, data modeling, and ETL pipelines to strengthen our reporting foundation.

This is a highly collaborative role — you'll work closely with internal stakeholders to understand reporting needs, provide PowerBI training to citizen developers, and promote data-driven thinking across the organization. In return, you'll gain greater ownership, plenty of growth opportunities, and a high degree of freedom.

Data Visualization - You will create visually appealing PowerBI reports, dashboards, and applications to make complex data insights easy to understand.

Additionally, you will establish governance policies and procedures to ensure data integrity, compliance, and security within the BI platform.
Data Modeling and Transformation - You will make a significant impact by designing and implementing data models that support PowerBI and SSRS reporting needs, ensuring efficient data retrieval and analysis. You'll also support and maintain ETL processes that ensure data quality, consistency, and performance across our reporting infrastructure.
PowerBI Training and Adoption Advocate - You will engage with all levels and functions across the organization. You will conduct training sessions and workshops for internal stakeholders and citizen developers, focusing on PowerBI usage, best practices, and advanced features.
Collaboration with Internal Customers - You will stay close to the action by working closely with internal customers to gather reporting requirements, understand business needs, and prioritize development efforts.

Team Oriented
Highly organized
Analytical
Having great attention to detail


And you should be motivated by...


Empowering yourself to learn how to do something. If you need a ton of handholding or a micro-manager boss, this is not the place for you.
Working in a lean, results-oriented environment, where you'll be expected to do more, take on more, and achieve more every year.
Having fun in an environment high on transparency, open to innovative new approaches with a supportive family feel

Collaborate with success managers and support team to ensure that Truveta partners can be successful with the platform.
Provide technical analytics support and directly work with customers on calls to troubleshoot code and platform questions.
Work with customers to achieve their goals, teaching them how to wrangle and analyze data using SQL, R and Python on RWD to address their empirical questions.
Collaborate closely with other Truveta teams to conduct investigations of data sources to demonstrate veracity to current customers.
Deliver feedback to internal teams based on customer requests to inform Truveta’s product roadmap.


Required Skills


Undergraduate or graduate level educational in clinical research, data analysis, clinical informatics or related field.
Experience working with large relational database consisting of millions of patients' data.
2+ years of experience wrangling and analyzing Electronic Health Record data or other Real World Data sources in life science companies, CROs, other EHR data companies or healthcare using SQL, R and Python.
Knowledge of clinical terminologies such as ICD, SNOMED, LOINC, NDC or RxNorm.
Willingness to learn new coding languages including internal proprietary coding language to analyze data and build cohorts.
Experience working with customers delivering high quality research analyses.
Ability to learn and adapt quickly in a dynamic start-up environment.


Preferred Qualifications

These qualifications are preferred but not required, please do not let them stop you from applying for this role. You will likely get the opportunity to learn how to do these more advanced analyses if you don’t already have experience with them.


Experience working with unstructured clinical data or natural language processing outputs

Want to be part of a high-performing team driving scalable solutions at the intersection of technology and operations? We’re looking for platform experts who thrive on structure, strategy, and solving.




We’re looking for a Social Listening & Insights Analyst who brings more than just monitoring skills—you bring the ability to uncover meaningful insights from complex social data and connect them to the bigger picture. Working within a large matrixed tech environment, you’ll help transform how we use social listening to inform business and marketing decisions across priority customer solution areas (CSAs).




As our Social Listening and Insights Analyst, you’ll support both planned and ad hoc reporting, contributing to a stronger insights-driven culture. This role is ideal for someone who’s both analytical and curious, with the drive to not just report on trends—but to ask better questions, spot patterns, and tell stories with data that shape strategy.




This person would join the Designit team that supports Microsoft Cloud Marketing, Blog, and Social. This world-class social team operates 100+ social media channels and 20+ marketing blogs designed for developers, IT decision makers, IT implementers, and business decision makers. Each month, we publish over 3,000 posts to help, inform, entertain, and engage across the globe. Azure, Power BI, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 are just a few examples of the innovative products and services that comprise the ecosystem.




What You’ll Do

Own and deliver recurring and ad hoc social listening reports across CSAs, tailored to specific campaign, brand, or business priorities.
Translate social data into clear, actionable insights that drive decisions—beyond just volume metrics.
Provide point-in-time analysis during key launches, events, or spikes in conversation.
Surface sentiment trends, audience behaviors, competitor comparisons, and whitespace opportunities.
Partner closely with social media managers, strategists, and ops leads to align reporting with campaign and business objectives.
Act as a thought partner—not just a report generator—by proactively identifying insight opportunities and storylines.
Help evolve our reporting frameworks, storytelling formats, and listening taxonomies over time.
Stay current on industry tools, best practices, and emerging technologies in the listening and analytics space.




What you bring:

3–5+ years of experience in social listening, digital analytics, or insights—ideally in agency, tech, or global brand settings.
Hands-on expertise with social listening tools (Sprinklr highly preferred, or others like Talkwalker, Brandwatch, NetBase, etc.).
Strong data analysis and synthesis skills; comfort with interpreting both quantitative and qualitative social data.
Ability to craft clear insights and deliver them in visually engaging and executive-friendly ways.
A sense of curiosity—asking “why” behind the data and seeking broader patterns or implications.
Experience working across multiple stakeholders and managing multiple requests at once in a fast-paced environment.
Solid understanding of the social landscape—platform nuances, content formats, and conversation patterns.
Bonus: familiarity with tagging structures, taxonomy building, or integration with broader research teams.




Why This Role Is Exciting

Social data has never been more valuable—but it’s only as powerful as the insights we draw from it. In this role, you’ll help elevate the way our team listens, understands, and acts on what our audiences are saying. You’ll play a critical part in shaping strategy, guiding content, and keeping a pulse on what matters most across one of the world’s leading tech brands.




Would you like to join a global organization that...

Supports well-being, realistically. We understand the always-on nature of social, and while work-life balance isn’t perfect every day, we aim to support our team with flexibility, transparency and trust.
Fosters a global culture of learning and advocacy. We believe diversity of thought, background, and experience strengthens our collective impact.
Encourages innovation and smart experimentation. We’re not afraid to test, learn, and iterate- it’s how we stay ahead.
Adapts to change with agility. Change is constant, and we value team members who see it as an opportunity, not a disruption.
Recognizes the power of collaboration. We reward team-minded thinking and cross-functional partnership.
Remote-first mindset. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our team, with remote work, virtual interviews, and virtual onboarding remaining in place for the foreseeable future.




Compensation Range: $90,000 - $100,000

This compensation range is indicative of the role. Compensation offered is on the basis of evaluation during interview process, the candidates range and depth of experience, business and market financials and internal pay parity.

More than 70% of what we consume in the U.S. is moved by trucks. Those trucks are powered by over 3.5 million drivers per year and create over $700B in annual revenue. Trucking is a massive industry but it is a traditional industry and like many traditional industries, it is ripe for innovation.

CloudTrucks is building the operating system for trucking and is the first platform specifically designed to empower truck drivers. Our all-in-one, “business in a box” solution optimizes and automates operations and accelerates cash-flow for drivers, so they can focus on building their business.

The Data Analytics team at CloudTrucks owns all business reporting end-to-end, and develops both internal and customer-facing, data analytics products in collaboration with Product development teams.

As a Data Analyst supporting the Go-To-Market (GTM) teams at CloudTrucks, you’ll have the opportunity to work with multiple teams across the company, including Sales, RevOps, Marketing and Growth Engineering. You’ll own data pipelines, reporting and in-depth analyses that help these teams make day-to-day product and business decisions.

As a data analyst, you’ll play a key role helping PMs and engineers build metrics to ensure they have adequate visibility into the onboarding flow, help them define, run and measure experiments and gather insights about future product improvements.
Marketing Our Marketing team is focused on driver acquisition. As a data analyst, you’ll have the opportunity to work closely with them to continue building and improving our Marketing Attribution models, and provide insights into the Marketing funnel and campaign performance.
RevOps Our RevOps team works closely with Sales to onboard drivers to CloudTrucks. As a data analyst, you’ll have the opportunity to help the team track and measure each step of the sales funnel and look for opportunities where processes can be improved. You’ll be able to combine sales and product data to do in-depth analysis and provide insights into funnel performance, define, build and monitor revenue impact metrics.


Responsibilities


Own end-to-end reporting from building the data pipeline to data visualization.
Build data pipelines to support both internal and customer facing products, and collaborate with Product development teams to launch and measure success.
Work cross-functionally to build KPIs, and develop complex transformative analyses that help teams improve their processes, make product and business decisions.
Communicate insights and recommendations to a broader audience, include technical and non-technical stakeholders.


What we are looking for


3+ years of experience as an analyst
Interest in Freight Industry
Experience helping GTM teams (Marketing, Sales, RevOps, Growth) make better data-driven decisions
Strong working knowledge of SQL and experience with Business Intelligence tools (Looker, Heap, Amplitude)
Experience building and maintaining Marketing Attribution Models and measuring campaign performance. Alternatively, strong working experience with MMP tools (Mobile Measuring Partner tools, like Singular, Adjust, AppFlyer)
Experience working with Ad Network data
Experience working directly with Sales and RevOps teams, with strong familiarity with sales motions and sales KPIs
Strong working experience with CRM tools like Salesforce or HubSpot
Exposure to software engineering principles - version control, code reviews, unit testing.
Strong interpersonal skills and ability to work cross-functionally.
Experience working alongside both technical and non-technical teams.
Ability to communicate and influence both technical and non-technical audiences.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $167,300 - $251,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Verkada is a leader in cloud-based B2B physical security. Verkada offers six product lines — video security cameras, access control, environmental sensors, alarms, workplace and intercoms — integrated with a single cloud-based software platform.

Designed with simplicity and scalability in mind, Verkada gives organizations the real-time insight to know what could impact the safety and comfort of people throughout their physical environment, while empowering them to take immediate action to minimize security risks, workplace frustrations and costly inefficiencies.

Founded in 2016, Verkada has expanded rapidly with 15 offices across three continents, 2,100+ full-time employees and 30,000+ customers across 70+ countries.

Overview

We are looking for an exceptional Sr. People Analytics Associate to join our growing People team. This role will partner with our Sr. Director of People Strategy and Operations to continue building and scaling our people analytics capability. This is a high-impact role for someone who’s excited to partner with People, Sales, Finance, and Executive teams to unlock insights that drive strategic talent decisions, improve employee experience, and support business growth.

Responsibilities


As a member of our People Strategy and Operations team, you will have an integral role in driving the insights, operations, and strategy. This role blends technical expertise, business acumen, and a passion for storytelling through data.
You will build the foundation for people analytics, including data pipelines, dashboards, and reporting standards across systems like Workday, Looker, Greenhouse, and Lattice.
You will partner closely with People Partners and business leaders to identify key metrics and deliver actionable insights across the employee lifecycle (e.g., hiring, attrition, engagement, promotions)
You will drive cross-functional analytics projects that support strategic decisions on org design, retention, performance, and compensation.
You will maintain a strong data governance framework to ensure accuracy, privacy, and consistency across systems and reporting.


Requirements


Since we’re still in scrappy startup mode, you’ll need to be a high-impact self-starter. You take initiative to move projects forward and can operate well with little guidance.
Raw Smarts: You’ve fine-tuned your first principle and conceptual problem-solving skills. You can look at complex problems and solve them from start to finish.
Strong analytical skills: you nerd out about data, can quickly structure analyses to answer key business questions to drive decision-making, and will also have perspectives on building the right data architecture. Advanced Excel and Google Sheets skills, with experience building and managing complex data models and calculations.
Technical capabilities: Proven experience designing data warehouses and dashboards (e.g., Looker, Workday, BigQuery), working with SQL, and integrating data across People systems. Experience with Looker preferred.
Flexibility and hustle: You manage change and ambiguity well, and have no problems juggling multiple priorities while executing in a fast-paced environment. You’re comfortable pivoting quickly and often.
5+ years of experience in people analytics, workforce strategy, or business analytics, ideally in a high-growth or tech environment.

Work closely with the performance marketing team to provide data-driven insights and optimize campaigns to achieve KPIs (e.g., ROAS, CAC, LTV).
Contribute to marketing mix modeling efforts to understand the incremental impact of each marketing channel on conversions and customer acquisition.
Develop data-driven forecasts, budgets, and projections for marketing campaigns; continuously update based on real-time data and performance.
Conduct deep-dive analysis on customer behavior, attribution, and path-to-purchase to identify opportunities for increased conversion and customer retention.
Build and maintain performance dashboards to provide real-time insights for marketing teams and leadership.
Design and analyze A/B tests to optimize ad creatives, targeting, and bidding strategies across platforms.
Partner with product, finance, and data science teams to ensure alignment and leverage insights across the organization.

5+ years in a data analytics role, ideally with a focus on performance or digital marketing within an e-commerce or technology company.
Proficiency in SQL and data visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Looker, Power BI).
Knowledge of statistical analysis and A/B testing; familiarity with Python or R is a plus.
Ability to interpret complex data and translate it into actionable insights, with a focus on detail, accuracy, and clarity.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills, with the ability to present data insights and recommendations effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

The Role

Are you ready to shape the future of how Fanatics uses data to drive business value across the global sports ecosystem? Fanatics is building a next-generation digital sports platform—and enterprise analytics is the connective tissue that powers investor confidence, monetization strategy, and cross-business insights.

This role sits within the Fanatics Ecosystem Data & Analytics team and focuses on surfacing high-impact insights that span across Fanatics’ Operating Companies: Commerce, Betting & Gaming, and Collectibles. You’ll help drive initiatives that power our investor storytelling, unlock new data monetization opportunities, and enable growth in areas like audience targeting, advertising, and platform-level performance. You’ll play a key role in helping senior leaders understand what’s working, what’s next, and where value is being created across the Fanatics ecosystem.

You’re a strategic thinker, a skilled storyteller, and a passionate analyst who sees data not just as numbers, but as a vehicle for alignment, acceleration, and transformation.

What You’ll Do


Partner with Enterprise leaders, FP&A, Fan Data Services, and teams across Commerce, Betting, and Collectibles to surface enterprise-level insights that shape corporate strategy and operational focus.
Drive analytical narratives and visualizations that support investor communications, executive reviews, and board materials.
Conduct rigorous analysis on product, user behavior, and revenue data to uncover strategic opportunities across Fanatics’ businesses and audiences.
Design and deliver KPIs, dashboards, and performance frameworks that enable a clear and consistent understanding of platform health and monetization levers.
Support the development and ongoing measurement of Fanatics Audience Network performance—including audience segmentation, campaign attribution, and monetization potential.
Contribute to modeling and forecasting efforts that bridge operational metrics with top-line revenue and audience growth.
Translate complex data into simple, actionable insights for senior stakeholders—bridging the gap between technical depth and business context.
Operate within a matrixed organization across multiple high-priority initiatives with varying levels of data maturity and strategic complexity.


What We’re Looking For


3–5+ years of experience in Analytics, Advertising, Strategy, Consulting, Investment Banking, or Corporate Development, ideally within a tech, media, or platform business.
Demonstrated ability to drive cross-functional initiatives that connect data with business value—especially in areas like advertising, revenue optimization, or investor relations.
Advanced proficiency in SQL and data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker; fluency in Excel/Google Sheets modeling.
Experience working with large, complex datasets and distilling them into executive-ready insights and visual stories.
A strong communicator with the ability to frame analytical work in the context of enterprise strategy, financial outcomes, and investor relevance.
Highly structured thinker who can thrive in ambiguous environments, prioritize effectively, and move quickly to impact.
Passion for the business of sports and the intersection of data, media, commerce, and fandom.
Collaborative, curious, and grounded—committed to elevating the team and the business as a whole.


The salary range for this position is $116,640 to $168,750, which represents base pay only and does not include short-term or long-term incentive compensation. When determining base pay, as part of a final compensation package, we consider several factors such as location, experience, qualifications, and training.

Summary

ABOUT SAINT LAURENT

Founded in 1961, Yves Saint Laurent was the first couture house to introduce the concept of luxury prêt-à-porter in a 1966 collection called ‘Rive Gauche’, synonymous with youth and freedom. This shift represented a first critical step in the modernization of fashion and revolutionized the sociocultural landscape. In 1999, the luxury goods division of the Kering Group acquired Yves Saint Laurent and, under the creative direction of Anthony Vaccarello since April 2016, continues to position the house at the summit of the luxury universe. Today, Saint Laurent collections include women’s and men’s ready-to-wear, shoes, handbags, small leather goods, jewelry, scarves, ties and eyewear.

The Role

Are you ready to shape the future of how Fanatics uses data to drive business value across the global sports ecosystem? Fanatics is building a next-generation digital sports platform—and enterprise analytics is the connective tissue that powers investor confidence, monetization strategy, and cross-business insights.

This role sits within the Fanatics Ecosystem Data & Analytics team and focuses on surfacing high-impact insights that span across Fanatics’ Operating Companies: Commerce, Betting & Gaming, and Collectibles. You’ll help drive initiatives that power our investor storytelling, unlock new data monetization opportunities, and enable growth in areas like audience targeting, advertising, and platform-level performance. You’ll play a key role in helping senior leaders understand what’s working, what’s next, and where value is being created across the Fanatics ecosystem.

You’re a strategic thinker, a skilled storyteller, and a passionate analyst who sees data not just as numbers, but as a vehicle for alignment, acceleration, and transformation.

What You’ll Do


Partner with Enterprise leaders, FP&A, Fan Data Services, and teams across Commerce, Betting, and Collectibles to surface enterprise-level insights that shape corporate strategy and operational focus.
Drive analytical narratives and visualizations that support investor communications, executive reviews, and board materials.
Conduct rigorous analysis on product, user behavior, and revenue data to uncover strategic opportunities across Fanatics’ businesses and audiences.
Design and deliver KPIs, dashboards, and performance frameworks that enable a clear and consistent understanding of platform health and monetization levers.
Support the development and ongoing measurement of Fanatics Audience Network performance—including audience segmentation, campaign attribution, and monetization potential.
Contribute to modeling and forecasting efforts that bridge operational metrics with top-line revenue and audience growth.
Translate complex data into simple, actionable insights for senior stakeholders—bridging the gap between technical depth and business context.
Operate within a matrixed organization across multiple high-priority initiatives with varying levels of data maturity and strategic complexity.


What We’re Looking For


3–5+ years of experience in Analytics, Advertising, Strategy, Consulting, Investment Banking, or Corporate Development, ideally within a tech, media, or platform business.
Demonstrated ability to drive cross-functional initiatives that connect data with business value—especially in areas like advertising, revenue optimization, or investor relations.
Advanced proficiency in SQL and data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker; fluency in Excel/Google Sheets modeling.
Experience working with large, complex datasets and distilling them into executive-ready insights and visual stories.
A strong communicator with the ability to frame analytical work in the context of enterprise strategy, financial outcomes, and investor relevance.
Highly structured thinker who can thrive in ambiguous environments, prioritize effectively, and move quickly to impact.
Passion for the business of sports and the intersection of data, media, commerce, and fandom.
Collaborative, curious, and grounded—committed to elevating the team and the business as a whole.


The salary range for this position is $116,640 to $168,750, which represents base pay only and does not include short-term or long-term incentive compensation. When determining base pay, as part of a final compensation package, we consider several factors such as location, experience, qualifications, and training.

Journey alongside a strong community of top talent who are relentless in their drive to build the simplest scalable cloud. If you have a growth mindset, naturally like to think big and bold, and are energized by the fast-paced environment of a true industry disruptor, you’ll find your place here. We value winning together—while learning, having fun, and making a profound difference for the dreamers and builders in the world.

We are looking for a Marketing Data Engineer who is passionate about helping developers and small businesses succeed with cloud technology.

Reporting to the Director of Growth Analytics and Operations, you will be a key technical contributor supporting Acquisition and Growth Marketing through clean, accessible, and actionable data. You’ll build the pipelines, systems, and services that empower our teams to scale their efforts across hundreds of thousands of customers.

What You’ll Be Doing


You’ll manage the data infrastructure that powers our growth: You will design, build, and maintain the ETL pipelines that extract data from backend services, transform it into usable formats, and load it into Snowflake for analysis and decision-making. Your work ensures our marketing and growth teams have the right data at the right time.
You’ll make customer data available in real-time: From building services that extract data from key systems like Marketo and Jitsu to ensuring clean ingestion into our CDP (Segment), you’ll be responsible for making customer behavior data actionable across marketing channels and dashboards.
You’ll ensure data reliability and governance: You’ll develop and maintain frameworks for data validation, quality monitoring, and governance. You'll document systems, automate processes, and support incident response to maintain high data integrity and system uptime.
You’ll work cross-functionally: Partnering with the Growth Engineering, Growth Marketing, Product, and Data Science teams to ensure data flows smoothly across systems and supports experimentation, measurement, and personalization at scale. You’ll be shipping code into our product and backend infrastructure to implement and operationalize your data goals!


What We’ll Expect From You


A deep understanding of data engineering systems: You have strong experience with Python and SQL, understand the principles of data modeling and pipeline architecture, and can build robust services to enable data sharing across tools like Snowflake, Segment, and Jitsu.
Full stack engineering chops and technical independence: You’re comfortable interfacing with backend and frontend systems that require engineering-level access. Prior experience with Go, React, Node.js and Typescript/Javascript will be valuable in this role, and experience with Kafka and CI/CD is a bonus. You can work autonomously to extract critical metadata and customer data from services used across the company.
Experience with cloud-native tools and infrastructure: You have hands-on experience with cloud data tools (e.g., Snowflake, Airflow, Segment) and containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes). Experience with dbt is a plus.
Operational rigor: You bring strong monitoring, documentation, and automation practices to your work. You know how to identify and troubleshoot pipeline issues and are proactive about root cause analysis and long-term stability.
Strategic problem-solving: You can see the big picture while owning the technical details. You bring ideas to life through experimentation, and you understand how clean, reliable data unlocks better customer experiences and business growth.
Domain experience: Familiarity with growth experimentation, product-led growth strategies, or digital marketing ecosystems is a plus.


Why You’ll Like Working for DigitalOcean


We innovate with purpose. You’ll be a part of a cutting-edge technology company with an upward trajectory, who are proud to simplify cloud and AI so builders can spend more time creating software that changes the world. As a member of the team, you will be a Shark who thinks big, bold, and scrappy, like an owner with a bias for action and a powerful sense of responsibility for customers, products, employees, and decisions.
We prioritize career development. At DO, you’ll do the best work of your career. You will work with some of the smartest and most interesting people in the industry. We are a high-performance organization that will always challenge you to think big. Our organizational development team will provide you with resources to ensure you keep growing.

While the philosophy around our benefits is the same worldwide, specific benefits may vary based on local regulations and preferences.
We reward our employees. The salary range for this position is $140,000 - $180,000 based on market data, relevant years of experience, and skills. You may qualify for a bonus in addition to base salary; bonus amounts are determined based on company and individual performance. We also provide equity compensation to eligible employees, including equity grants upon hire and the option to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Program.
We value diversity and inclusion. We are an equal-opportunity employer, and recognize that diversity of thought and background builds stronger teams and products to serve our customers.

Partner closely with a team of people analysts, business intelligence analysts, and data engineers to evolve our talent data model and design consumable, high-impact dashboards and visualizations.
Drive the development and implementation of new people analytics processes and data products (e.g., metadata tagging), to enhance data accessibility and insight generation.
Communicate clearly and effectively across teams, levels, and leadership.
Manage, mentor and onboard junior employees within the team to build leadership skill set.

At CarGurus (NASDAQ: CARG), our mission is to give people the power to reach their destination. We started as a small team of developers determined to bring trust and transparency to car shopping. Since then, our history of innovation and go-to-market acceleration has driven industry-leading growth. In fact, we’re the largest and fastest-growing automotive marketplace, and we’ve been profitable for over 15 years.

What We Do

The market is evolving, and we are too, moving the entire automotive journey online and guiding our customers through every step. That includes everything from the sale of an old car to the financing, purchase, and delivery of a new one. Today, tens of millions of consumers visit CarGurus.com each month, and ~30,000 dealerships use our products. But they're not the only ones who love CarGurus—our employees do, too. We have a people-first culture that fosters kindness, collaboration, and innovation, and empowers our Gurus with tools to fuel their career growth. Disrupting a trillion-dollar industry requires fresh and diverse perspectives. Come join us for the ride!

Role Overview

We are looking for a Senior Product Data Analyst to join the team, which tackles a complex data environment, builds out core assets, runs experiments, and executes on many more unstructured analytics tasks to support the growth of the Mobile App.

Our Product Data Analytics org as a whole supports our Product and Engineering teams, providing the final word on all analytics for CarGurus’ user and dealer experiences. We are looking for thoughtful, curious, internally driven candidates who can dive into complex data and draw novel, insightful conclusions.

What You'll Do


Using your SQL expertise, conduct exploratory empirical analyses that bridge disparate data sources (e.g. app and website usage, subscription records, inventory volumes, etc.) to quantify product performance, user behavior, and/or market trends. Doing so will require distilling unstructured “big data” into actionable insights.
Creatively compress sweeping, high-level exploratory requests into specific calculations that address your stakeholders’ underlying needs.
Relentlessly dig into the data – consulting with other individuals and teams as you judge necessary – beyond the letter of the initial assignment, to hammer out any anomalies or self-direct your inquiry into other relevant issues.
Be comfortable escalating and automating your analyses using R/Python scripting.
Be the authority on A/B experimentation, advising engineers and product managers on everything from the necessary data points to collect, required sample sizes, optimal metrics to examine, robustness of numerical findings, and the bottom-line success or failure of the tested changes.
Provide technical guidance on and ideas for improving A/B testing-related tools, algorithms, and automated processes.
Conduct self-directed research on the latest trends in A/B experimentation, and map out internal improvements based on your findings.
Advocate for specific, data-driven product innovations that help further high-level company strategy, primarily in partnership with the Product/Engineering teams.
Participate in brainstorming and planning discussions across the organization to these ends.
Avoid passivity in the face of flawed proposals; tactfully and persuasively push back against potential missteps.
Craft the metrics that define business success, condensing abstract or loosely-defined concepts down to concrete calculations.
Audit and improve existing metrics to better inform the business’ needs.
Build intuitive dashboards and other visual monitoring tools to guide daily decision-making by senior stakeholders and the company at large.
Experiment with new kinds of visualizations that you believe could be better utilized in the organization.
Re-work underlying code to appropriately structure visualization inputs.
