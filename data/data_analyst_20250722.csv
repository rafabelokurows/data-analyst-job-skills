Data modelling and dbt knowledge are a plus.

Job Description

We are on the lookout for a Staff Product Analyst to join the Consumer Product Analytics team on our journey to always deliver amazing experiences.

At Delivery Hero, you’ll shape the global consumer experience for millions of users. Your work will have a direct impact on how we attract and retain customers, creating data-driven, personalized interactions that keep them coming back. As part of our Consumer Team, you’ll enhance customer satisfaction and drive global growth and profitability through innovative projects.

The Consumer Product Analytics Team drives product strategy and innovation by providing actionable insights on customers and products, contributing to business success. In this role, you'll have the opportunity to shape the experience for millions of users across our worldwide portfolio of platforms (FoodPanda, Pedidos Ya, Woowa, Yemeksepeti, Foodora, Talabat, HungerStation, eFood, and Glovo), directly impacting customer satisfaction and driving growth. Our diverse team of data professionals is based in Berlin, working closely with product directors, product managers, engineers, and business stakeholders to directly influence product direction. We collaborate with a larger data team, including data engineers, data scientists, and ML engineers, to share knowledge and expertise.

At Consumer Product Analytics, you will have the opportunity to access high volume, rich user behavior data, engage in end to end product development cycles, work on complex product problems, and learn from many experienced data professionals.

The main responsibilities of the Product Analytics Team include:


Strategic Impact & Product Leadership: Act as a key strategic data partner to product leadership, influencing product roadmap and investment decisions through deep analytical insights and foresight. Proactively identify high-impact analytical opportunities to drive significant customer satisfaction and business growth.
Advanced Experimentation & Causal Inference: Design, implement, and rigorously analyze A/B tests and other experimental designs (e.g., multi-variate, quasi-experiments) with a strong emphasis on advanced statistical methods for robust hypothesis validation, accurate impact measurement, and understanding causal relationships. Drive the standardization and continuous improvement of our experimentation framework across multiple brands.
Metric Framework & OKR Ownership: Define, establish, and own comprehensive product metric frameworks and quarterly OKRs. Drive alignment on ""what good looks like"" across product teams, ensuring clear, measurable goals that align with strategic business outcomes.
Data Integrity & Tracking Excellence: Take ownership of tracking definition and work closely with various Delivery Hero brands to significantly improve the reliability, consistency, and completeness of user behavior tracking for our discovery tools. Proactively identify and resolve data quality issues at scale.
Scalable ETL & Reporting Solutions: Design, build, and maintain robust data pipelines and self-service dashboards, ensuring data accessibility and empowering product teams to make data-driven decisions independently.
Deep Dive & Exploratory Analysis: Conduct complex, end-to-end exploratory analyses on large-scale user behavior data (transactional, clickstream, etc.) to uncover non-obvious insights, identify root causes of trends, and directly inform product strategy and roadmap development.
Technical & Mentorship Leadership: Contribute significantly to the growth and development of fellow product analysts through knowledge sharing sessions, best practice dissemination, workflow optimizations, and active participation in hiring and onboarding processes. Champion and drive analytical excellence within the team and broader organization.


Qualifications


9+ years of experience in product analytics or a related data-focused role, preferably within rapidly growing and dynamic environments, and with a broad mission scope or multiple stakeholders.
Expert proficiency in SQL and Python for complex data manipulation, analysis, and modeling. Experience with BigQuery and large-scale cloud data warehousing concepts is a strong plus.
Expertise in statistical methods applied to experimental design (A/B testing, multivariate tests, etc.), causal inference, and robust hypothesis validation. You should be able to navigate complex statistical challenges and explain methodologies clearly.
Extensive experience working with large-scale user behavior data (e.g., transactional, clickstream, app usage), including data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to derive actionable insights.
Proficiency with at least one data visualization tool such as Looker Studio (Data Studio), Tableau, QlikView, or Power BI, with a proven ability to create compelling and insightful dashboards.
Demonstrated ability to influence and collaborate with multiple stakeholders, including senior product managers, engineers, and business leaders. You can clearly communicate complex analytical findings and successfully drive large-scale analytics projects end-to-end (e.g., defining success metrics for a tribe, standardizing measurement across brands, or implementing new experimentation methodologies).
Experience with customer behavior tracking platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, MixPanel, Snowplow, Segment, Tealium).


Nice to have:


Experience with Airflow, DBT, or other data pipelining tools
Familiarity with recommender systems, ML models, or ranking algorithms
Experience scaling analytics processes or experimentation programs across multiple teams or brands.

About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

At Gigs, we're building the operating system for mobile services—a platform that lets tech companies embed global connectivity into their products effortlessly.

Just as Stripe lets any business add a payment button in seconds, Gigs empowers platforms to weave in connectivity—bridging the traditional world of telecom with modern tech. From fintechs launching mobile services to HR platforms offering work phone plans, we automate provisioning and remove telecom complexity.

Our team of around 90 people across the US and Europe, backed by nearly $100 million in funding from Ribbit Capital, Google, and Y Combinator. As one of the fastest-growing tech companies, bringing together early-stage engineers, product builders, and business athletes from companies like Stripe, Airbnb, and Shopify. We're tackling deep technical and regulatory challenges to make connectivity truly seamless.

If you're driven by curiosity, creativity, and the chance to shape the future of telecom, we'd love to hear from you.

The Role

As a Senior Data Analyst, you'll be a foundational part of our data team — shaping how data is modeled, shared, and turned into insight across the company. You'll join a team of 3 spread across data engineering, analytics engineering and insight generation. This will be the second dedicated Senior Data Analyst in the team.

What You Will Do


Collaborate cross-functionally with teams like Finance, Growth, Product, and Operations to understand their needs and ensure data is actionable and impactful. This could mean delivering a dashboard, an insight, or a data model powering automation.
Be a thought partner on how we define core metrics, track business performance, and build trust in data across Gigs.
Empower internal teams by leveling up power users and educating data consumers, through clear communication, thoughtful documentation, stakeholder collaboration, and occasional training sessions.
Build the analytics content that matters, both internally and externally. You'll work with the Product team to identify key customer-facing metrics and play a crucial role in delivering those insights via dashboards and data products.
Not every data point is available yet. We all work end to end. Work with product to define new data points, translate messy source data into clean, reliable models that power dashboards, metrics, and product decisions.
You will work with a modern event-based data platform across Bigquery, Fivetran, dbt, dagster, Lightdash and Hex.


What We Are Looking For


6+ years of experience in analytics with a focus on end to end delivery. Having worked closely with Finance stakeholders, Product in a B2C context (to support customer launches and ongoing implementations) or experience with customer-facing data products are strong plus points.
A strong understanding of data modeling best practices (e.g. dimensional modeling, testing, documentation).
Skilled at building alignment and managing expectations with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Experience translating complex business requirements into well-structured data pipelines and models.
Familiarity with Git, CI/CD, Python and strong SQL.
A product mindset: you care about usability, performance, and building for scale. You see the content you deliver as a product and are interested in having those being used.
This is not your first rodeo. You have worked in small and early data teams, grown along side them and worked in larger teams and data platforms. You've seen what works and doesn't in both and are looking to apply this in your next role.
Clear communicator — you can work cross-functionally and explain complex topics to non-technical stakeholders
Strong bias for action: You move quickly, deliver incrementally, and aren't afraid to ship v1. You identify what's missing and work with stakeholders to fill the gaps.
Experience working in fast-moving startups or remote-first teams is a plus.


Work at Gigs

At Gigs, we know that different work styles and teams thrive in different environments. Some work best remotely, while others rely on in-person collaboration to spark creativity and drive execution. We're remote-friendly by design, but we also offer hubs for those who need the energy and focus that only in-person collaboration can bring.


Gigs Pads: Our hubs in San Francisco, London, Amsterdam, and Berlin are vibrant spots where Gigsters connect, collaborate, and create together.
Gigs Republic: Twice a year, our entire company comes together to strengthen bonds, align on big ideas, and share experiences that fuel our culture and ignite growth.


What We Offer

At Gigs, we believe in rewarding excellence. We offer competitive compensation and stock options because we see you as a true partner in our growth. We also provide stipends for your home office or work setup, a budget for learning and development to fuel your career, and of course, a free phone and international data plan

If you're driven by curiosity, creativity, and the chance to shape the future of telecom, let's talk.

By presenting your work processes and results, you keep your direct and extended team up to date with your work progress
Weigh tradeoffs (e.g., upside/downside for different options) and clearly communicate data-driven recommendations to influence cross-functional stakeholders
Provide clinical experience to support the processing and harmonisation of structured data points



Who You Are

You have familiarity with electronic health record systems, electronic data capture forms, or other data management systems
You have strong communication skills, including the ability to communicate clinical issues effectively with a diverse team of software engineers, product managers, and other technical staff
You demonstrate exceptional attention to detail but you are also pragmatic in the search for solutions
You enjoy working in a fast-paced, cross functional and international environment and are able to react with flexibility to ambiguity

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis

Continuously learn and grow with support from senior engineers and team leads
Help maintain a team culture rooted in curiosity, empathy, and continuous improvement

2–5 years of software engineering experience, ideally in backend or data-focused roles
Experience with Databricks, Spark, or similar big data technologies
Proficiency in Python and SQL
Exposure to cloud platforms such as GCP or AWS
Familiarity with CI/CD tools and infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Docker, Terraform, CircleCI)
Strong communication and collaboration skills; a team player excited to learn and grow


Bonus Points


Familiarity with MLOps concepts and tools (e.g., MLflow, model versioning)

You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.
