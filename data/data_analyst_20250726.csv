Our mission is to enable researchers to find cures faster, empower every clinician to be an expert, and help families make the most informed decisions about their care. Achieving Truveta’ s ambitious vision requires an incredible team of talented and inspired people with a special combination of health, software and big data experience who share our company values.

Truveta was born in the Pacific Northwest, but we have employees who live across the country. Our team enjoys the flexibility of a hybrid model and working from anywhere. In person attendance is required for one week during the year for Truveta Planning Week.

For overall team productivity, we optimize meeting hours in the pacific time zone. We avoid scheduling recurring meetings that start after 3pm PT, however, ad hoc meetings occur between 8am-6pm Pacific time.

Who We Need

Truveta is rapidly building a talented and diverse team to tackle complex health and technical challenges. Beyond core capabilities, we are seeking problem solvers, passionate and collaborative teammates, and those willing to roll up their sleeves while making a difference. If you are interested in the opportunity to pursue purposeful work, join a mission-driven team, and build a rewarding career while having fun, Truveta may be the perfect fit for you.

This Opportunity

The Analytics Response Team (ART) sits within Truveta’s broader Partner Analytics team and plays a critical role in coordinating with internal teams and supporting customers to get fast, high-quality answers from Truveta data. As a Partner Data Analyst on the ART team, you will help ensure customers find value in the data, support issue investigation, and build confidence in the platform through efficient, responsive analytics. You will support data quality efforts, conduct analyses, answer customer questions, and support new data releases. You will be solving consequential problems in healthcare using an EHR database of ~100 million patients (and growing!) and make an impact on patient care. As a Partner Data Analyst, you will work at the intersection of EHR data knowledge and efficient data delivery. You’ll support feasibility analyses, quickly summarize patient populations, and assist in identifying and tracking data issues. This position is ideal for someone with hands-on experience working with EHR or healthcare data, strong data wrangling skills, and a passion for translating data into actionable insights.

Responsibilities


Wrangle large healthcare datasets and translating clinical concepts into structured queries.
Summarize populations and generate feasibility numbers from clinical data quickly and accurately.

Ambience is developing the most capable AI systems for healthcare and medicine. As healthcare costs soar to 17.3% of US GDP and a projected shortage of 100,000 physicians within the next decade, the need for AI is critical. Our frontline healthcare workers are overwhelmed, with only 27% of the average clinician's day spent on direct patient care.

Our vision is to advance healthcare by empowering clinicians with safe, intelligent AI agents that improve quality, reduce costs, and enhance both patient and provider experiences.

Headquartered in San Francisco, we have secured $100M in funding from top investors, including Kleiner Perkins, OpenAI Startup Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, Optum Ventures, Human Capital, and Martin Ventures. We collaborate with leading AI experts such as Jeff Dean, Richard Socher, Pieter Abbeel, and AIX Ventures.

Join us in the endeavor of accelerating the path to safe & useful clinical super intelligence by becoming part of our community of problem solvers, technologists, clinicians, and innovators.

About The Role

We’re hiring a Senior Data Analyst to help lay the foundation of a modern analytics function at Ambience. You’ll partner closely with our Data Engineering team to transform raw data into trusted insights, intuitive dashboards, and self-service tools that support every function across the company—from Product and Clinical teams to Customer Success, Finance, and GTM.

This is a high-impact, hands-on role for someone who loves turning complexity into clarity. You’ll be one of our first analytics hires, setting the bar for how we define metrics, ship dashboards, and embed analytics into daily decisions. If you’re excited to bring structure to ambiguity, build scalable tools from scratch, and drive data literacy across teams—we’d love to meet you.

What You’ll Accomplish


Build intuitive, actionable dashboards for internal teams (Product, Customer Success, Execs) and external stakeholders (customers, partners)
Define and maintain trusted KPI definitions for core business metrics—MAU, feature adoption, churn risk, ROI impact, and more
Launch predictive models (e.g. churn forecasting, ROI projections) and surface insights in tools teams already use (e.g. Slack, Notion)
Develop account health, telemetry, and ROI dashboards used to guide QBRs, product roadmap, and revenue strategy
Collaborate with data engineers on semantic layers, testing frameworks, and scalable data modeling
Lead data bootcamps, publish a searchable data catalog, and champion self-service analytics across functions
Translate stakeholder questions into clear KPIs, hypotheses, and decision-ready analysis


Must-Have Skills

What We Look For


5+ years in a full-time analytics/BI role at a high-growth company or data-focused organization
Expert-level SQL for complex joins, window functions, query optimization
Strong proficiency in Python or R for data wrangling, analysis, and light ML/forecasting
Mastery of at least one modern BI platform (e.g. Power BI, Looker, Tableau, Sigma)
Experience partnering cross-functionally with teams like Product, CS, Ops, GTM, and Finance
Comfort working with Data Engineering—reviewing dbt PRs, aligning on schema design, and ensuring SLA compliance
Exceptional communication and data storytelling skills—comfortable briefing execs and mentoring power users


Nice-to-Have Skills


Experience as an early analytics hire, especially in a startup environment where you’ve built workflows from scratch
Experience operationalizing ML models into workflows (e.g. Slack alerts, CRM triggers)
Background in healthcare, finance, or compliance-driven domains
Passion for mission-driven work in sectors like health, education, or climate
Demonstrated mentorship and leadership in cross-functional or data literacy initiatives


We’d Love to Hear From You If You…


Thrive in fast-paced, ambiguous environments and take initiative without waiting for direction
Think like a systems builder—crafting scalable tools, not just one-off analyses
Communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical partners
Care about making a real-world impact, especially in mission-critical domains like healthcare
Are energized by teaching others how to use data, not just analyzing it yourself


Pay Transparency

The base compensation for this role is approximately $200,000 - $230,000 per year, excluding equity or bonus. We offer meaningful equity so our team shares directly in the value we create. If you’re outside this range, we still encourage you to apply—we evaluate compensation case by case based on experience.

Location

We’re targeting candidates who can join us in our San Francisco office a few days a week. We believe the best data work happens through tight, cross-functional collaboration—and we’ve designed our hybrid model to make that easy and energizing.

Being at Ambience:


An opportunity to work with cutting edge AI technology, on a product that dramatically improves the quality of life for healthcare providers and the quality of care they can provide to their patients
Dedicated budget for personal development, including access to world class mentors, advisors, and an in-house executive coach
Work alongside a world-class, diverse team that is deeply mission aligned
Ownership over your success and the ability to significantly impact the growth of our company
Competitive salary and equity compensation with benefits including health, dental, and vision coverage, quarterly retreats, unlimited PTO, and a 401(k) plan

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $167,300 - $251,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Data Analyst, Client Product Analytics

About http://Realtor.com :

At http://realtor.com , we have the most comprehensive and accurate coverage of real estate listings and the most engaged users across all the online real estate portals. Our mission is to make buying, selling, renting, and living in homes easier and more rewarding for everyone.

The Data Science and Analytics organization at http://realtor.com sits at the heart of this mission. We process and analyze terabytes of data every day that enable decisions for millions of home buyers, sellers, renters, dreamers, and real estate professionals. Our goal is to use this data to make the home buying experience a breeze for our consumers. We empower them with the most up-to-date information on properties, help them find their dream homes in the least amount of time, and match them with the most suitable realtor to meet their unique, individual needs.

Role Description:

We are looking for the best data and analytical minds to help us measure the effectiveness of our products that aim to make it simple and easy to buy and sell a home. To accomplish that task, we are looking for a Senior Data Analyst with a consumer services, business, or technology background to join our expanding Product Analytics team within the Enterprise Data Science and Analytics organization. The team you are joining acts as a “trusted” partner to our key product stakeholders helping them answer their most critical business questions. This could be accomplished by conducting strategic deep insight analysis, A/B experimentation design and measurement, or creating new innovative ways to measure the success of the business. This is a job for someone who not only possesses strong technical skills, but also the ability to take data and mold it into a cohesive story that enables our stakeholders to make informed business decisions.

The mission of the Product Analytics team is to be very strategic and pivotal to ensure that the company stays on course with meeting key OKRs (Objective and Key Results). This is not a traditional reporting role - a successful candidate will be able to take large amounts of data and be able to surface the “why” around data movements - not just the “what”

Responsibilities:

Business Performance Reporting, Visualization and Analysis: Be the primary partner for our cross-functional stakeholders to understand product performance. When a metric is ahead or behind expectations, dig in to drive meaningful, actionable insights that help the business performance improve or double-down on success.
Deep-Dive Analysis: Use advanced techniques (A/B experimentation, statistical modeling, matched pair, and/or machine learning) to analyze consumer product performance at a lead and feature level.  Create a rich understanding of how people are interacting with product features and use these insights to then make recommendations.
Opportunity Identification and Sizing: Both to set goals and help evaluate potential product enrichment  opportunities, you will be tasked with forecasting and opportunity sizing. This will help our Product stakeholders understand the short-run and long-run dynamics of proposed changes to our product strategy, and create targets for driving business performance as well as optimize lead generation and funnel improvement opportunities.
Partnership and Communication: Partner closely with our Product stakeholders to identify and unlock opportunities, and with other data teams to improve platform capabilities around data architecture, data visualization, data modeling, and testing platforms.
Build trust in all interactions and with Enterprise Consumer Data Mart and be an advocate for adoption
Be responsible for monitoring the success of visitors' engagement and conversion by tracking metrics and building new estimated KPIs if necessary (e.g., product usage metrics)
Build relationships with other products and analytics teams to share best practices and enrich analytic practices
Conduct quantitative analysis, ad hoc reports, & statistical models to understand the health and latest trends among product engagement and funnel conversion consumer metrics
Create impactful data insights and analysis from Analytic Plan creation thru End-of-Analysis summaries

Requirements:

Bachelor's Degree in Business Analytics, Math, Economics
2-5+ years of work experience analyzing data to answer business questions
Experience using data to analyze product feature performance is preferred
Experience in a consumer subscription business also relevant
Advanced knowledge in SQL and knowledge in Python or R a plus
Experience with digital analytics platforms like Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics is preferred
Experience with data exploration and data visualization tools such as Tableau, Shiny, Streamlit, etc.
Experience with cloud-based data environments such as AWS and Snowflake
Advanced technical and modeling skills including Excel or Google Sheet skills (e.g. pivot, vlookup, etc.) and data analytics 
Understanding of experimentation and statistics concepts (e.g. confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, etc.)
Ability to think strategically, analyze and interpret product performance drivers as well as how analyze a conversion funnel with key fallout points identified
Intense curiosity, high intellectual and analytical horsepower, passionate pursuit of analytics driven insights
Strong communication skills as well as written and verbal presentation skills and experience presenting to diverse audiences
Ability to thrive in a largely remote organization
Comfort working in a highly agile, intensely iterative environment
Self-motivated and self-managing, with strong time management and organizational skills

Are you passionate about improving our environment for this generation and those to follow? Are you ready to take on new challenges and collaborate with a future-focused team leading the way into new markets? Join Nexamp! 

This is where you can learn from industry leaders and become one yourself. It's fast-paced, mission-based work that challenges the status quo. Be on the team that's changing the world. 

What we’re looking for: 

We're looking for a Lead Data Analyst to craft insightful and compelling data stories, empower business owners across Nexamp to make more effective data-driven decisions, and help build our self-service data platform. As one of the nation’s largest and longest tenured solar and storage owner operators – and one of the few that is fully vertically integrated – our data is a differentiator in the market and a catalyst for future growth. You’ll be solving uniquely challenging data problems, alongside a strong team, and for a company in which the business model and mission are inseparably intertwined: our solar farms save customers money, help the planet, and are profitable for Nexamp and its investors. 

This role will be hybrid, based out of our Boston office, and you will report to the Director of Product, Data.

What you’ll do:  

Own and Deliver Data Products: Independently gather requirements for, prioritize, deliver, maintain, and continuously improve reusable data models, dashboards, analyses, A/B tests, and other data assets. Act as the product manager and implementer for your domain’s data offerings. Implement work using advanced SQL and BI tool skills. 
Be a Trusted Data Partner: Become the subject matter expert for data in your business areas. Identify opportunities for impact, proactively surface insights, support decision-making, and contribute to and influence business strategy and initiatives. Serve as your business stakeholders’ right hand. Support other business areas opportunistically.
Drive Data Quality, Documentation, and Engineering: Create and maintain comprehensive data documentation and communicate updates to your stakeholders. Write user stories or tickets for data engineering, validate data mapping, conduct QA, and implement data quality monitoring.
Foster Data Culture and Adoption: Monitor the usage of data assets, increase data literacy, and promote self-service through BI tools among stakeholders. Provide training, guidance, and support as needed.  
Collaborate Across the Data Team: Work within a centralized data team using agile methodologies. Collaborate with peer analysts through overlapping work, priority shifting, and code reviews to broaden your Nexamp knowledge.
Influence Data Strategy: Partner with the data architect, engineers, scientists, and analysts to shape the vision and roadmap for Nexamp’s data platform. Define and track annual OKRs to measure your impact.  

What you’ll bring: 

5-7 years of experience as a data analyst serving business owners and collaborating with data engineers (experience in the energy/construction industry is a plus, but not required) 
Advanced in SQL and BI tool administration and usage (experience with Databricks and Sigma are a plus, but not required) 
Strong track record of independently solving problems.
Commitment to Nexamp's mission and have a passion for solving tomorrow's climate crisis today.
Demonstrated experience in effectively communicating information, ideas, and perspectives with people inside and beyond your organization.   
Experience in showcasing initiative to make improvements to current work, processes, products, and services across the organization. We value accountability and an ownership mentality. 
Ability to ask appropriate questions, analyze data, identify the root causes of problems, and present creative solutions. 
Expertise in building strong internal and external relationships with customers and stakeholders, instilling trust and loyalty across the industry. 
Eagerness to develop a fundamental understanding of how Nexamp operates and then apply that knowledge effectively to inform business decisions.  

If you don’t meet 100% of the above qualifications, but see yourself contributing, please apply.

At Nexamp, our mission is to build the future of energy so it is clean, simple, and accessible for all. We are committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, veteran status, or any other basis protected by law.

You’ll love working here because:  

Not only will you get to take part in meaningful work and have the chance to change the world alongside innovative, dedicated, and motivated peers, but you will also have access to all the benefits that Nexamp offers! This includes our competitive compensation package; a 401(k) employer-match; health, dental, and vision insurance starting day one; flexible paid time off and holiday PTO; commuter benefits, and cell phone reimbursement.

We provide healthy snacks, coffee, service days and other volunteer opportunities, company outings, and more!

About CyberArk:

CyberArk (NASDAQ: CYBR), is the global leader in Identity Security. Centered on privileged access management, CyberArk provides the most comprehensive security offering for any identity – human or machine – across business applications, distributed workforces, hybrid cloud workloads and throughout the DevOps lifecycle. The world’s leading organizations trust CyberArk to help secure their most critical assets. To learn more about CyberArk, visit our CyberArk blogs or follow us on X, LinkedIn or Facebook.

Job Description

CyberArk is seeking a Senior Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst with a passion for sales strategy and business insight to join our Business Analytics team. In this role, you will act as a strategic partner to Sales and Sales Operations leaders around the globe—translating data into compelling narratives that drive better, faster decisions. You’ll play a key role in shaping how performance is measured, understood, and improved across our global go-to-market (GTM) organization. While you’ll contribute to dashboard development and scalable reporting in Tableau, this role goes far beyond building reports—you’ll be expected to uncover trends, connect dots across complex datasets, and communicate insights in a way that resonates with non-technical audiences. The ideal candidate is a business-minded analyst with strong sales acumen, excellent communication skills, and an instinct for asking the right questions to get to the heart of the problem.

Responsibilities:



Serve as an embedded analytics partner to global Sales and Sales Operations stakeholders, proactively identifying opportunities to improve pipeline, productivity, and conversion
Craft clear, executive-ready narratives based on deep-dive analyses of sales performance, pipeline coverage, segmentation, and revenue trends
Translate complex data and technical concepts into actionable recommendations that are easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand and act upon
Design and evolve self-service dashboards and tools in Tableau that reduce friction and enable faster time-to-decision
Maintain a high bar for data accuracy and consistency across reports and ad hoc deliverables
Collaborate cross-functionally with Sales, RevOps, Marketing, Finance, and IT to align on business definitions and ensure reliable analytics infrastructure
Help drive a data-driven culture by enabling stakeholders to interpret KPIs and use insights effectively



Qualifications



4–6 years of experience in Sales Analytics, Sales Operations, Business Intelligence, or a related field
Proven ability to extract and communicate insights from complex data—especially in a Sales or GTM environment
Strong business judgment, with experience working directly with senior stakeholders and cross-functional teams
Working knowledge of SQL and experience with Tableau or a similar BI platform (depth of tool expertise less important than the ability to learn quickly)
Understanding of B2B sales metrics, pipeline stages, and CRM data (Salesforce experience a plus)
Excellent storytelling skills—both written and verbal—with the ability to tailor messages to executive and frontline audiences
Self-starter who thrives in a fast-paced, dynamic environment and isn’t afraid to ask questions or challenge assumptions
Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative or business-related field
Smart, bold but humble attitude to work collaboratively with CyberArk colleagues



Additional Information

CyberArk is an Equal Opportunity Employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or protected Veteran status.

We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of employment Visa at this time.

The salary range for this position is $87,000 – $121,000/year, plus commissions or discretionary bonus, which will be based on the employee’s performance. Base pay may also vary considerably depending on job-related knowledge, skills, and experience.
