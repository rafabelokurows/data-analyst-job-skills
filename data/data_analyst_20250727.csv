About us:

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved.

Note - It is 100% Remote role, based in India

We're looking for a curious, detail-driven, and business-savvy Analytics & BI Specialist who's passionate about turning data into decisions. This isn't just a dashboarding role - it's about enabling smarter, faster, and more informed decision-making across the company using modern analytics and AI capabilities.

This role will support the deployment of AI-powered, collaborative analytics solutions and contribute to elevate our BI maturity, empower business users, and provide executive-level insights.

From ensuring data accuracy and building impactful dashboards, to supporting machine learning initiatives and collaborating with data scientists - this role is central to scaling a culture of intelligent, insight-driven operations.

What You'll Do

Interactive Analytics Platform:


Build collaborative dashboards with annotation, threaded discussions, and rich user engagement capabilities.
Integrate with Slack and other collaboration tools to enable seamless communication around data.


QA, Governance, and Data Trust


Implement alerting systems and pipeline validation for proactive issue detection.
Build automated tests to validate data models, joined data integrity and ETL accuracy.
Build confidence by ensuring accuracy across all analytics layers


Power Business Impact through AI and Analytics


Collaborate with data scientists, engineers, and business teams to design solutions that solve real problems
Use data and advanced analytics to uncover opportunities, improve operations, and challenge assumptions
Support the deployment of machine learning models by ensuring the right data, context, and explainability are in place
Contribute to predictive insights that drive efficiency, personalization, or automation across functions


Own and Improve End-to-End Analytics Solutions


Coordinate with IT for upstream integration needs
Ensure insights flow cleanly from data sources to dashboards and stakeholder hands
Proactively identify blockers and opportunities in the analytics workflow


Champion a Data-Driven Culture


Empower users with training, documentation, and thoughtful design
Facilitate feedback loops to continuously improve solutions
Help scale self-service BI and responsible AI practices across teams


What Makes You a Great Fit


You love solving business problems with data, not just building reports
You're energized by making data useful - clear, trusted, and actionable
You're curious about AI and believe in its potential to elevate decision-making
You're known for your proactive approach and strong sense of ownership.


What You'll Need


5+ years or more experience in analytics, BI, or data-focused roles
Expertise in Tableau for building clean, insightful dashboards
Strong SQL skills (we use PostgreSQL via tools like pgAdmin / DBeaver)
Prior experience enabling executive-level dashboards and designing proactive insights.
Experience in cross-functional collaboration - product, ops, IT, or data science teams
A mindset for quality - validating data, checking assumptions, and building trust
Experience with workflow automation tools like Apache Airflow is a plus


Ideal Candidates Will Also Possess


Familiarity with Salesforce and SaaS business KPIs
An understanding of ML workflows and how you can support model monitoring
Passion for responsible AI, explainability, and ethical data use
Familiarity with AI agent frameworks such as n8n, Langflow, or similar orchestration tools.
A strong interest in exploring and integrating low-code/no-code automation platforms for enhancing analytics workflows.
Willingness to prototype intelligent agents that can automate repetitive tasks, orchestrate data flows, and augment business decisions.


Why This Role Matters

We believe data is a strategic asset only when it's trusted, understood, and used. Your work will directly impact how decisions are made - from frontline ops to boardroom strategy. You'll be part of a team that's not just reactive but anticipates what's needed next.

If you're ready to shape the future of analytics, explore how AI can amplify human insight, and build the systems that power business momentum - we'd love to hear from you.

💼 £45,000–£55,000 + benefits | Hybrid – London




We’re working with a pioneering nuclear energy company that’s transforming how low-carbon power is designed, delivered, and scaled across the UK. As they continue to grow, they’re looking for a skilled and curious Data Analyst to help drive smarter decisions across engineering, operations, and strategy.




This isn’t your typical analyst role — it’s a chance to work at the intersection of energy, innovation, and impact. You’ll be turning complex datasets into meaningful insights that shape everything from reactor performance to long-term infrastructure planning.




Why This Role Stands Out

✔ Work on nationally significant clean energy projects

✔ Join a purpose-driven business at the cutting edge of nuclear technology

✔ Strong technical team with a collaborative, learning-focused culture

✔ Hybrid working with flexible hours and career development support




What You’ll Be Doing

Analysing operational and performance data from nuclear systems and infrastructure
Building dashboards, reports, and predictive models to inform business and engineering decisions
Working closely with engineers, scientists, and leadership teams to translate data into action
Supporting continuous improvement and regulatory reporting processes
Contributing to data strategy, governance, and tooling decisions as the team scales




What They’re Looking For

Strong experience in data analysis, ideally within engineering, energy, or regulated sectors
Proficient in SQL, Python (or R), and data visualisation tools like Power BI or Tableau
Comfortable working with complex datasets and extracting clear insights
Great communication skills — able to explain technical findings to non-technical stakeholders
Passionate about using data to contribute to a cleaner energy future




If you’re looking for a meaningful role where your analysis directly supports the UK’s path to net zero — this is it.

Collaborate cross-functionally with marketing, leasing, revenue management and operations to improve the end-to-end resident experience.




Qualifications

Proven analytical experience in BTR, hospitality, airlines, hotels, or real estate.
Experience in building and structuring datasets or data cubes to support scalable reporting and analytics—ideally with a view to implementing BI tools such as Tableau or Power BI.

We're looking for a curious, detail-driven, and business-savvy Analytics & BI Specialist who's passionate about turning data into decisions. This isn't just a dashboarding role - it's about enabling smarter, faster, and more informed decision-making across the company using modern analytics and AI capabilities.

This role will support the deployment of AI-powered, collaborative analytics solutions and contribute to elevate our BI maturity, empower business users, and provide executive-level insights.

From ensuring data accuracy and building impactful dashboards, to supporting machine learning initiatives and collaborating with data scientists - this role is central to scaling a culture of intelligent, insight-driven operations.

What You'll Do

Interactive Analytics Platform:


Build collaborative dashboards with annotation, threaded discussions, and rich user engagement capabilities.
Integrate with Slack and other collaboration tools to enable seamless communication around data.


QA, Governance, and Data Trust


Implement alerting systems and pipeline validation for proactive issue detection.
Build automated tests to validate data models, joined data integrity and ETL accuracy.
Build confidence by ensuring accuracy across all analytics layers


Power Business Impact through AI and Analytics


Collaborate with data scientists, engineers, and business teams to design solutions that solve real problems
Use data and advanced analytics to uncover opportunities, improve operations, and challenge assumptions
Support the deployment of machine learning models by ensuring the right data, context, and explainability are in place
Contribute to predictive insights that drive efficiency, personalization, or automation across functions


Own and Improve End-to-End Analytics Solutions


Coordinate with IT for upstream integration needs
Ensure insights flow cleanly from data sources to dashboards and stakeholder hands
Proactively identify blockers and opportunities in the analytics workflow


Champion a Data-Driven Culture


Empower users with training, documentation, and thoughtful design
Facilitate feedback loops to continuously improve solutions
Help scale self-service BI and responsible AI practices across teams


What Makes You a Great Fit


You love solving business problems with data, not just building reports
You're energized by making data useful - clear, trusted, and actionable
You're curious about AI and believe in its potential to elevate decision-making
You're known for your proactive approach and strong sense of ownership.


What You'll Need


5+ years or more experience in analytics, BI, or data-focused roles
Expertise in Tableau for building clean, insightful dashboards
Strong SQL skills (we use PostgreSQL via tools like pgAdmin / DBeaver)
Prior experience enabling executive-level dashboards and designing proactive insights.
Experience in cross-functional collaboration - product, ops, IT, or data science teams
A mindset for quality - validating data, checking assumptions, and building trust
Experience with workflow automation tools like Apache Airflow is a plus


Ideal Candidates Will Also Possess


Familiarity with Salesforce and SaaS business KPIs
An understanding of ML workflows and how you can support model monitoring
Passion for responsible AI, explainability, and ethical data use
Familiarity with AI agent frameworks such as n8n, Langflow, or similar orchestration tools.
A strong interest in exploring and integrating low-code/no-code automation platforms for enhancing analytics workflows.
Willingness to prototype intelligent agents that can automate repetitive tasks, orchestrate data flows, and augment business decisions.


Why This Role Matters

We believe data is a strategic asset only when it's trusted, understood, and used. Your work will directly impact how decisions are made - from frontline ops to boardroom strategy. You'll be part of a team that's not just reactive but anticipates what's needed next.

If you're ready to shape the future of analytics, explore how AI can amplify human insight, and build the systems that power business momentum - we'd love to hear from you.

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-

The Position

Uplight is creating a new category of energy. We make software that manages energy resources in homes and businesses—including things like smart thermostats, electric vehicles, solar panels, storage batteries, heat pumps, and even people’s behavior—to generate, shift, or save energy to balance the grid, making it more efficient and reliable. This creates clean energy capacity that can be used by the power grid instead of burning more fossil fuels. Our solutions accelerate the transition to clean energy and save money for energy customers.

We are seeking a Data Engineer focusing on data platform enablement to support our mission and scale our impact

How You Will Make An Impact

As a Data Engineer at Uplight, you’ll play a central role in designing and maintaining the infrastructure that ingests, transforms, and delivers data across our platform. Your work ensures that data systems are reliable, scalable, observable, and cost-efficient—forming the backbone of many customer-facing and data science-driven solutions.

You’ll partner with cross-functional teams including analysts, product managers, and data scientists to ensure the platform meets the evolving needs of our business and our users.

What You Get To Do


Design, build, and maintain data pipelines using Databricks (Spark, Delta Lake) and Python.
Collaborate across teams to develop core platform capabilities—such as orchestration, metadata management, and data quality—delivering scalable, reusable solutions
Improve reliability and fault tolerance of ingest pipelines handling large volumes of utility data.
Build and support MLOps tooling, including data pipelines, model registries, and serving infrastructure
Participate in the full software development lifecycle: design, build, test, deploy, and support
Contribute to a remote-first team that values agility, collaboration, and clarity—favoring whiteboarding, async design docs, and reflective retros over rigid ceremonies.
Continuously learn and grow with support from senior engineers and team leads
Help maintain a team culture rooted in curiosity, empathy, and continuous improvement


What You Bring To Uplight


2–5 years of software engineering experience, ideally in backend or data-focused roles
Experience with Databricks, Spark, or similar big data technologies
Proficiency in Python and SQL
Exposure to cloud platforms such as GCP or AWS
Familiarity with CI/CD tools and infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Docker, Terraform, CircleCI)
Strong communication and collaboration skills; a team player excited to learn and grow


Bonus Points


Familiarity with MLOps concepts and tools (e.g., MLflow, model versioning)
Experience with real-time or streaming data systems (e.g., Kafka, Structured Streaming)
Understanding of data observability, lineage, and quality
Prior work in the energy or utility space
Strong grasp of Big Data challenges including cost vs performance tradeoffs


Don’t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women, marginalized genders and people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification. At Uplight we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.
