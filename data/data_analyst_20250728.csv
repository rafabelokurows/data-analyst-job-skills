Want to be part of a high-performing team driving scalable solutions at the intersection of technology and operations? We’re looking for platform experts who thrive on structure, strategy, and solving.




We’re looking for a Social Listening & Insights Analyst who brings more than just monitoring skills—you bring the ability to uncover meaningful insights from complex social data and connect them to the bigger picture. Working within a large matrixed tech environment, you’ll help transform how we use social listening to inform business and marketing decisions across priority customer solution areas (CSAs).




As our Social Listening and Insights Analyst, you’ll support both planned and ad hoc reporting, contributing to a stronger insights-driven culture. This role is ideal for someone who’s both analytical and curious, with the drive to not just report on trends—but to ask better questions, spot patterns, and tell stories with data that shape strategy.




This person would join the Designit team that supports Microsoft Cloud Marketing, Blog, and Social. This world-class social team operates 100+ social media channels and 20+ marketing blogs designed for developers, IT decision makers, IT implementers, and business decision makers. Each month, we publish over 3,000 posts to help, inform, entertain, and engage across the globe. Azure, Power BI, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 are just a few examples of the innovative products and services that comprise the ecosystem.




What You’ll Do

Own and deliver recurring and ad hoc social listening reports across CSAs, tailored to specific campaign, brand, or business priorities.
Translate social data into clear, actionable insights that drive decisions—beyond just volume metrics.
Provide point-in-time analysis during key launches, events, or spikes in conversation.
Surface sentiment trends, audience behaviors, competitor comparisons, and whitespace opportunities.
Partner closely with social media managers, strategists, and ops leads to align reporting with campaign and business objectives.
Act as a thought partner—not just a report generator—by proactively identifying insight opportunities and storylines.
Help evolve our reporting frameworks, storytelling formats, and listening taxonomies over time.
Stay current on industry tools, best practices, and emerging technologies in the listening and analytics space.




What you bring:

3–5+ years of experience in social listening, digital analytics, or insights—ideally in agency, tech, or global brand settings.
Hands-on expertise with social listening tools (Sprinklr highly preferred, or others like Talkwalker, Brandwatch, NetBase, etc.).
Strong data analysis and synthesis skills; comfort with interpreting both quantitative and qualitative social data.
Ability to craft clear insights and deliver them in visually engaging and executive-friendly ways.
A sense of curiosity—asking “why” behind the data and seeking broader patterns or implications.
Experience working across multiple stakeholders and managing multiple requests at once in a fast-paced environment.
Solid understanding of the social landscape—platform nuances, content formats, and conversation patterns.
Bonus: familiarity with tagging structures, taxonomy building, or integration with broader research teams.




Why This Role Is Exciting

Social data has never been more valuable—but it’s only as powerful as the insights we draw from it. In this role, you’ll help elevate the way our team listens, understands, and acts on what our audiences are saying. You’ll play a critical part in shaping strategy, guiding content, and keeping a pulse on what matters most across one of the world’s leading tech brands.




Would you like to join a global organization that...

Supports well-being, realistically. We understand the always-on nature of social, and while work-life balance isn’t perfect every day, we aim to support our team with flexibility, transparency and trust.
Fosters a global culture of learning and advocacy. We believe diversity of thought, background, and experience strengthens our collective impact.
Encourages innovation and smart experimentation. We’re not afraid to test, learn, and iterate- it’s how we stay ahead.
Adapts to change with agility. Change is constant, and we value team members who see it as an opportunity, not a disruption.
Recognizes the power of collaboration. We reward team-minded thinking and cross-functional partnership.
Remote-first mindset. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our team, with remote work, virtual interviews, and virtual onboarding remaining in place for the foreseeable future.




Compensation Range: $90,000 - $100,000

This compensation range is indicative of the role. Compensation offered is on the basis of evaluation during interview process, the candidates range and depth of experience, business and market financials and internal pay parity.

As a Product Analyst, you will have the opportunity to develop, test, launch and scale member banking experience products. Through experimentation, user behavioral analysis, sophisticated statistical and data science modeling, and dashboards development, you will surface product insights and recommendations that will increase adoption, engagement, and retention of our members.

In this role, you will work closely with product managers, user research, engineers, product & lifecycle marketing, and operational stakeholders to foster a data-driven product development culture, advise our product roadmaps, and build a deep understanding of member behavior.

Full-time employees are also eligible for a bonus, competitive equity package, and benefits.

In this role, you can expect to


Keep a pulse on performance metrics and KPIs. You will be positioned to have a view of the business, product, and member base and encouraged to understand and explain trends.
Foster a data-driven, test-and-learn culture with your passion for telling stories with data - not only surfacing insights but also presenting those insights and recommendations to encourage and inspire change.
Partner widely with product, engineering, research, and design to translate your insights to guide product development. You’ll use data to help the organization understand how members are interacting with Chime and convert that to business and experience implications.
Lead experimentation by providing mentorship on how they should be run, defining success metrics and data requirements, evaluating impact, and providing strategic direction.
Advise roadmap, analysis and metric ideation, and strategic discussions with stakeholders.
Collaborate with analysts and other functions to help bridge business questions and technical (data / computational) solutions.


To thrive in this role, you have


4+ years in data-focused roles (post-internship), building analytical infrastructure and data tools that support a wide audience and facilitate decisions of trade-offs. B2C product analytics and FinTech experience preferred.
Expertise in SQL - you innately translate business questions to queries, understand the edge cases of joins, and can explore a warehouse to find data most appropriate to the problem.
Familiarity in R or python - you write reproducible code and have a tendency toward automation.
Experience leading experimentation, statistical analysis, and sophisticated measurement (e.g. causal inference) E2E to guide decision making.
Hands-on experience with BI/Visualization tools (Looker, Tableau, PowerBI, etc).
Experience building metric frameworks to understand user behaviors.
Ability to think holistically to solve business problems at hand and navigate through ambiguity.
Excellent stakeholder managements skills, with a record of working cross-functionally to achieve results.
A focus on impact - you don’t stop with just recommendations but ensure to see work through to changing the business.

World is a network of real humans, built on privacy-preserving proof-of-human technology, and powered by a globally inclusive financial network that enables the free flow of digital assets for all. It is built to connect, empower, and be owned by everyone.

About The Team

The Data Science team is responsible for providing business intelligence services to the whole project and for deriving data-driven insights to support World’s key decisions. Because of our unique growth model of using a global network of Orb Operators to verify individuals’ unique humanness, we require a high-performing Data Science team that is able to manage and analyze large amounts of data generated by our products and operations.

Marketing Our Marketing team is focused on driver acquisition. As a data analyst, you’ll have the opportunity to work closely with them to continue building and improving our Marketing Attribution models, and provide insights into the Marketing funnel and campaign performance.
RevOps Our RevOps team works closely with Sales to onboard drivers to CloudTrucks. As a data analyst, you’ll have the opportunity to help the team track and measure each step of the sales funnel and look for opportunities where processes can be improved. You’ll be able to combine sales and product data to do in-depth analysis and provide insights into funnel performance, define, build and monitor revenue impact metrics.


Responsibilities


Own end-to-end reporting from building the data pipeline to data visualization.
Build data pipelines to support both internal and customer facing products, and collaborate with Product development teams to launch and measure success.
Work cross-functionally to build KPIs, and develop complex transformative analyses that help teams improve their processes, make product and business decisions.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $167,300 - $251,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.<br><br>Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

The Roku Culture

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Are you passionate about improving our environment for this generation and those to follow? Are you ready to take on new challenges and collaborate with a future-focused team leading the way into new markets? Join Nexamp! 

This is where you can learn from industry leaders and become one yourself. It's fast-paced, mission-based work that challenges the status quo. Be on the team that's changing the world. 

What we’re looking for: 

We're looking for a Lead Data Analyst to craft insightful and compelling data stories, empower business owners across Nexamp to make more effective data-driven decisions, and help build our self-service data platform. As one of the nation’s largest and longest tenured solar and storage owner operators – and one of the few that is fully vertically integrated – our data is a differentiator in the market and a catalyst for future growth. You’ll be solving uniquely challenging data problems, alongside a strong team, and for a company in which the business model and mission are inseparably intertwined: our solar farms save customers money, help the planet, and are profitable for Nexamp and its investors. 

This role will be hybrid, based out of our Boston office, and you will report to the Director of Product, Data.

What you’ll do:  

Own and Deliver Data Products: Independently gather requirements for, prioritize, deliver, maintain, and continuously improve reusable data models, dashboards, analyses, A/B tests, and other data assets. Act as the product manager and implementer for your domain’s data offerings. Implement work using advanced SQL and BI tool skills. 
Be a Trusted Data Partner: Become the subject matter expert for data in your business areas. Identify opportunities for impact, proactively surface insights, support decision-making, and contribute to and influence business strategy and initiatives. Serve as your business stakeholders’ right hand. Support other business areas opportunistically.
Drive Data Quality, Documentation, and Engineering: Create and maintain comprehensive data documentation and communicate updates to your stakeholders. Write user stories or tickets for data engineering, validate data mapping, conduct QA, and implement data quality monitoring.
Foster Data Culture and Adoption: Monitor the usage of data assets, increase data literacy, and promote self-service through BI tools among stakeholders. Provide training, guidance, and support as needed.  
Collaborate Across the Data Team: Work within a centralized data team using agile methodologies. Collaborate with peer analysts through overlapping work, priority shifting, and code reviews to broaden your Nexamp knowledge.
Influence Data Strategy: Partner with the data architect, engineers, scientists, and analysts to shape the vision and roadmap for Nexamp’s data platform. Define and track annual OKRs to measure your impact.  

What you’ll bring: 

5-7 years of experience as a data analyst serving business owners and collaborating with data engineers (experience in the energy/construction industry is a plus, but not required) 
Advanced in SQL and BI tool administration and usage (experience with Databricks and Sigma are a plus, but not required) 
Strong track record of independently solving problems.
Commitment to Nexamp's mission and have a passion for solving tomorrow's climate crisis today.
Demonstrated experience in effectively communicating information, ideas, and perspectives with people inside and beyond your organization.   
Experience in showcasing initiative to make improvements to current work, processes, products, and services across the organization. We value accountability and an ownership mentality. 
Ability to ask appropriate questions, analyze data, identify the root causes of problems, and present creative solutions. 
Expertise in building strong internal and external relationships with customers and stakeholders, instilling trust and loyalty across the industry. 
Eagerness to develop a fundamental understanding of how Nexamp operates and then apply that knowledge effectively to inform business decisions.  

If you don’t meet 100% of the above qualifications, but see yourself contributing, please apply.

At Nexamp, our mission is to build the future of energy so it is clean, simple, and accessible for all. We are committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, veteran status, or any other basis protected by law. By encouraging a culture where ideas and decisions come from all people, we believe it will help us grow, innovate, and be a part of environmental and social change.

You’ll love working here because:  

Not only will you get to take part in meaningful work and have the chance to change the world alongside innovative, dedicated, and motivated peers, but you will also have access to all the benefits that Nexamp offers! This includes our competitive compensation package; a 401(k) employer-match; health, dental, and vision insurance starting day one; flexible paid time off and holiday PTO; commuter benefits, and cell phone reimbursement. We have headquarters in Boston, MA and Chicago, IL, in addition to growing offices nationwide. We provide healthy snacks, coffee, service days and other volunteer opportunities, company outings, and more!  

Nexamp's People team manages all aspects of recruitment and hiring within our organization. We want to inform third-party recruiters, staffing firms, and related agencies that Nexamp does not accept unsolicited resumes. Resumes will only be considered from these entities if a signed agreement is in place and the People team explicitly authorizes external recruiting assistance for a specific position. Any unsolicited resumes received will be deemed the property of Nexamp. We want to emphasize that Nexamp is not liable for any fees associated with unsolicited resumes.
