Technical & Mentorship Leadership: Contribute significantly to the growth and development of fellow product analysts through knowledge sharing sessions, best practice dissemination, workflow optimizations, and active participation in hiring and onboarding processes. Champion and drive analytical excellence within the team and broader organization.

Expertise in statistical methods applied to experimental design (A/B testing, multivariate tests, etc.), causal inference, and robust hypothesis validation. You should be able to navigate complex statistical challenges and explain methodologies clearly.
Extensive experience working with large-scale user behavior data (e.g., transactional, clickstream, app usage), including data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to derive actionable insights.
Proficiency with at least one data visualization tool such as Looker Studio (Data Studio), Tableau, QlikView, or Power BI, with a proven ability to create compelling and insightful dashboards.

💼 £45,000–£55,000 + benefits | Hybrid – London




We’re working with a pioneering nuclear energy company that’s transforming how low-carbon power is designed, delivered, and scaled across the UK. As they continue to grow, they’re looking for a skilled and curious Data Analyst to help drive smarter decisions across engineering, operations, and strategy.




This isn’t your typical analyst role — it’s a chance to work at the intersection of energy, innovation, and impact. You’ll be turning complex datasets into meaningful insights that shape everything from reactor performance to long-term infrastructure planning.




Why This Role Stands Out

✔ Work on nationally significant clean energy projects

✔ Join a purpose-driven business at the cutting edge of nuclear technology

✔ Strong technical team with a collaborative, learning-focused culture

✔ Hybrid working with flexible hours and career development support




What You’ll Be Doing

Analysing operational and performance data from nuclear systems and infrastructure
Building dashboards, reports, and predictive models to inform business and engineering decisions
Working closely with engineers, scientists, and leadership teams to translate data into action
Supporting continuous improvement and regulatory reporting processes
Contributing to data strategy, governance, and tooling decisions as the team scales




What They’re Looking For

Strong experience in data analysis, ideally within engineering, energy, or regulated sectors
Proficient in SQL, Python (or R), and data visualisation tools like Power BI or Tableau
Comfortable working with complex datasets and extracting clear insights
Great communication skills — able to explain technical findings to non-technical stakeholders
Passionate about using data to contribute to a cleaner energy future




If you’re looking for a meaningful role where your analysis directly supports the UK’s path to net zero — this is it.

London | Hybrid

£50–60k + benefits




Join a well-backed, growing bank in the middle of a major transformation - modernising its systems, launching new business lines, and putting data at the centre of it all.




This is a chance for a hands-on Data Analyst to make a real impact. You'll work closely with business teams, shape how data is used across the bank, and help build the foundations of a more data-driven culture.




If you're looking to grow your career while doing meaningful work - not just pulling reports - this could be a great fit.




What You’ll Be Doing

Work with stakeholders across the business (Risk, Compliance, Change) to understand and solve real-world data problems
Clean, validate, and reconcile data from multiple systems, including core banking and CRM
Support data migration efforts as the bank upgrades and modernises its platforms
Contribute to shaping data governance and improving data quality across the organisation
Ensure reporting data meets internal governance and compliance standards
Be part of the wider transformation journey, helping the bank scale its data maturity




Essential Skills

Strong SQL skills
Experience working with multiple relational databases (e.g. SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres)
Awareness of data modelling concepts
Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail
Ability to work with non-technical stakeholders and explain complex data clearly
Proactive, organised, and comfortable working in a fast-changing environment




Desirable Skills

Familiarity with BI tools like Power BI or Tableau
Basic Python or scripting for data manipulation
Understanding of ETL pipelines or data flows
Experience with core banking or financial systems
Exposure to cloud-based platforms (e.g. Azure)
Awareness of regulatory frameworks like GDPR or BCBS239




Why This Role Stands Out

Backed by a major European bank – stability + long-term growth
Transformation in motion – new leadership, new systems, and a clear modernisation plan
Big impact, small team – get visibility, influence change, and work closely with senior decision-makers
Supportive environment – strong team culture, mentoring, and variety in the work
Hybrid working – 3 days in the office based in a brand-new central London office




If you’re a data analyst who enjoys making sense of complex data and wants to play a part in shaping the future of a growing bank - we’d love to hear from you. Apply today!

Collaborate cross-functionally with marketing, leasing, revenue management and operations to improve the end-to-end resident experience.




Qualifications

Proven analytical experience in BTR, hospitality, airlines, hotels, or real estate.

Experience in revenue management, pricing analytics, or marketing attribution.
Exposure to customer or guest satisfaction data (e.g. NPS, reviews, feedback tools).
Previous work with leasing systems or property management software.

Please note the work location is in our London Hub and no relocation assistance is offered for this role.

As we are in the holiday season, please note that there may be delays in the recruitment process. We thank you for your patience and understanding during this period.


Core Responsibilities

Bring your understanding of data platforms together with your retail/e-commerce knowledge and natural curiosity into play in this role to be part of a pioneering data and analytics team bringing digital transformation to life in our commercial areas! You will





Partner with Shopper digital product teams to ensure high quality data is collected and published to LEGO Nexus (DataBricks) to a standard fit for purpose for downstream delivery of data products.
Transform, cleanse and enrich data to build self-serve data sources for use across analytical teams, the broader A&I organisation, LEGO® Retail teams & other data consumers (ie personalization, digital consumer engagement).
Develop self-serve dashboards and establish the use of these tools with LEGO Retail and broader Commercial colleagues to drive data driven decision making.
Collaborate with colleagues across LEGO® Retail, Data Science and A&I Commercial Analytics to continually iterate and enrich data products & overall data availability.
Enable LEGO® Retail specific data understanding and champion data literacy via guidelines, training, drop-in sessions, documentation, and knowledge sharing.
Partner with the Data Office to ensure platforms, tools & processes meet business needs, acting as inputters, collaborators, testers and/or ambassadors.
Consistently champion best practices in data product development within the team, across LEGO® Retail and with the broader analytics community, helping ensure data integrity, -quality, and -scalability of overall LEGO® Retail data products on the LEGO Data Platform.




Play your part in our team succeeding

The department’s key focus is to enable self-service data products for LEGO® Retail data consumers and decision makers, helping shape data-driven actions both for operational optimisation purposes and tactical and strategical decision recommendations. The key collaborators of this role will initially be heavily focused in Marketing & e-Commerce but have potential to expand to be multifunctional in areas such as Stores, Finance, Operations etc.

This role is essential as we further invest in our digitalization agenda, and our new data strategy, including scaling the LEGO® Data Platform to unlock the value from data across the LEGO® Group. In order to become truly data-driven, our first party retail and direct to consumer activity is the cornerstone to everything we do. This role will help both enrich our current data landscape and bring new data variables to life, but also enable important data development projects around the business to use LEGO® Retail data that will both increase accuracy in the models and speed up insights to action.

Do you have what it takes?

We’re looking for candidates with a solid foundation in a relevant field such as Mathematics, Sciences, Business Intelligence, or Analytics — either through formal education or hands-on experience with proven results using relevant tools.

You bring experience as a Data Specialist, in Data Solutions, Analytics Engineering, or Data Engineering. You’re confident working with large structured and unstructured datasets and have solid skills in SQL, Python, or similar languages. You’re also comfortable building visualizations in Power BI or equivalent tools to support business decision-making.

Ideally, you have worked in the Retail industry and are able to bridge technical and non-technical worlds — explaining constraints and trade-offs to colleagues at all levels, including leadership.

You are thorough, detail-oriented, and passionate about delivering results, even in changing or complex environments. You take ownership, work independently, and thrive in collaboration, bringing a #OneTeam mindset. A positive, can-do attitude, natural curiosity, and the courage to challenge constructively are key to your approach.

You’re fluent in English (spoken and written), and open to occasional travel (up to 10 days per year) for team meetings or workshops.

Cross-culture understanding of working with global colleagues and partners across multiple time zone
Experience working with ETL processes and knowledge of data transformation best practices.

🎓 Regular Lunch & Learn sessions
👯‍♂️ Buddies
🦸‍♂️ Mentors


This role reports into the Head of Client Strategy and is based at our offices in Kentish Town. This role is envisaged as full-time but we are happy to consider flexible options for the right candidate.

Who We Are

Mumsnet is the UK's biggest website for parents, and our purpose is to make their lives easier. We've got some of the busiest forums in Europe, with users offering each other advice and support 24/7 (as well as more content, bloggers, videos, events and campaigns than you can shake a rattle at). We want to be indispensably useful for parents, and a great place to work.

Why work for us?

We focus on steady, sustainable growth, putting purpose (to make parent's lives easier) before profit. We expect great performance, agility and collaboration in every role; cross-team working with talented, clever people is the best part of life at Mumsnet. Most importantly we're looking for candidates with a growth mindset - we know everyone makes mistakes, the important thing is to learn from them and to share your learnings.

We embraced flexible and home working a long time before COVID, and we care much more about outputs than hours on the clock. We don't only want to hire the best people: we want to retain them. If you need some flexibility, let us know and we'll do our best.

We're committed to diversity and equality (see our policy here) and we think we're second to none in the all-round support we offer to parents and carers at work (see our parental leave policies here). Working for Mumsnet means never having to pretend you don't have a family or other commitments, and we promise never to keep you away from a school appointment.

We have a healthy line-up of sandwich lunches, knowledge sessions, monthly socials and sports teams, as well as an unhealthy line-up of staff parties at Kentish Town's excellent pubs and restaurants.

Working Environment


📍 Hybrid: 2 days/week at our Kentish Town office (although it's possible to do more office days if it suits you)


Benefits

☀️ Buy More Holiday Scheme

Sometimes 25 days just isn't enough. If you need extra time to chase the sun, extend a trip, or just enjoy more lazy mornings, you can buy extra holiday days to make it happen.

🚲 Cycle2Work Scheme*

Fresh air, exercise, and no more cramped commutes? Sign us up. Our Cycle2Work scheme helps you save money on a new bike, so you can pedal your way to work (or just around the park).

📈 EMI Share Options Scheme (After 12 Months)

After a year with us, you'll have the chance to own a piece of what we're building together through our EMI share options scheme. Because when we grow, you should benefit too.

🫶🏼 Employee Assistance Programme

Life isn't always smooth sailing, and that's why we offer confidential support whenever you need it—whether it's advice, counseling, or just someone to chat to.

🪙 Mumsnet Workplace Pension Scheme

Thinking about your future? We contribute to your pension to help you build financial security for later on. Retirement may seem far away, but it's never too early to plan.

🚗 Electric Vehicle Scheme*

Go green and get behind the wheel of an electric car at a more affordable rate. Better for the planet, better for your wallet, and let's be honest—EVs are just really fun to drive.

📗 Bespoke Learning Subscriptions + Weekly ""Drop Everything and Learn"" Time

We believe learning should be part of your job, not an afterthought. That's why we provide tailored learning subscriptions and set aside dedicated time each week for you to step away from work and level up your skills.

🛍️ Leisure & Retail Perks via Perkbox

Who doesn't love a good discount? With Perkbox, you get exclusive deals on everything from gym memberships to your favorite high-street brands. Treat yourself!

👩🏽‍⚕️ BUPA Private Medical or Dental Cover*

Your health matters, full stop. We offer private medical cover through BUPA, so you can access the care you need, when you need it.

🍼 Enhanced Parental Leave

Welcoming a new addition to the family is a big moment, and we want to support you every step of the way. Our enhanced parental leave gives you more time to bond, adjust, and soak up those early days—because family comes first.

🧘🏽 Wellness Benefits (Daily Workouts & Meditations via Perkbox)

A healthy mind and body make for a happy team. Whether it's a quick morning workout or a lunchtime meditation session, Perkbox gives you access to wellness resources to keep you feeling your best.

🍕 Monthly Team Social Events

Great teams are built on great connections. Once a month, we get together for a social event—whether that's a meal, an activity, or just an excuse to get together and have fun.

💸 Annual Team Bonus Opportunities

When we do well, so do you. We offer annual bonus opportunities based on team performance, because success is always better when it's shared.


Eligible upon successful completion of probationary period

A public interest law firm led by former Maryland Deputy Attorney General Thiru Vignarajah is seeking tenacious and passionate associates to work at a firm with a diverse pro bono practice that assists seniors, small businesses, and victims of crime, corruption, and exploitation with no means to pursue justice and nowhere else to turn.

 

About Thiru Vignarajah

 

The son of Baltimore City schoolteachers and proud product of public schools himself, Thiru went from Woodlawn High School to Yale University and Harvard Law School, where he served as President of the Harvard Law Review. He then clerked for Judge Guido Calabresi on the U.S. Court of Appeals and Justice Stephen G. Breyer on the U.S. Supreme Court. Thiru served as a federal and city prosecutor before being named Deputy Attorney General. He subsequently joined DLA Piper, where he was a litigation partner for five years. A devoted public servant, Thiru has run for Mayor and State’s Attorney for Baltimore. Although his campaigns fell short, Thiru has honored his pledge to continue to fight for the people of Baltimore and beyond.

 

Through his pro bono work, Thiru has scored a number of notable victories for neglected groups and individuals who had run out of options.

 

-   When city prosecutors set an arsonist free on a plea deal after he torched his ex-girlfriend’s house while she and two roommates slept inside, Thiru successfully fought to invalidate the plea and push for a stiffer penalty — the defendant was returned to custody and is now serving a 22-year sentence in federal prison.

 

-   When Baltimore City was poised to give a $8.4 million city contract to a company that had repeatedly failed to honor its commitments to minority contractors, Thiru successfully pushed the City to reconsider. The company was eventually debarred for 3 years, and the minority contractor was ultimately granted the award.

 

-   When Vanessa Wagner was at risk of losing her home in a tax sale, Vignarajah fought and succeeded in saving a home she’d inherited from her parents.

 

-   When Charles Adams could not get a minimum-wage city job while he was on home detention, Thiru successfully pushed the city to give him a chance and later spoke on his behalf before the Baltimore County judge who took the rare step of giving a criminal defendant a suspended sentence and a second chance.

 

-   When prosecutors proposed returning to the juvenile system the young squeegee worker who killed a motorist as the victim was returning to his car, Thiru successfully spoke up for the victim’s family who vigorously opposed the remand. Scott was kept in adult court and was later convicted of manslaughter.

 

-   When a top prosecutor on the Eastern Shore was named a judge, Thiru was appointed special prosecutor and asked to handle the murder prosecution of James Reddick, who was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

 

Currently, Thiru is fighting for the family of a sanitation worker who died from heat exhaustion in conditions that resemble modern-day slavery and for families of crime victims seeking a measure of justice for their loss. 




On some of the most consequential issues facing Baltimore, Thiru has stood up for the disadvantaged and disenfranchised — and has won. From taking down BGF gang members to taking on BGE’s bullying practices, Thiru’s tireless and fearless work has made him the voice of the people.

 

Responsibilities: 




Represent clients in court proceedings, settlement negotiations, and to the media. 




- Conduct research and prepare legal documents including pleadings, appeals, and agreements. 




- Build trusting and constructive relationships with diverse clients and help them navigate the gauntlet of litigation from intake through resolution. 




- Maintain organized client files, ensuring that materials are kept confidential and accessible. 




Qualifications: 




- JD degree from an accredited law school and an active Maryland bar license. 




- Demonstrated passion for and experience in pro bono legal work. 




- Exceptional written and verbal communication skills. 




- High level of professionalism, ethics, and commitment to client confidentiality. 




- Proficiency in research tools such as Westlaw or LexisNexis. 




Compensation: 




This is a full-time, in-person position offering a unique opportunity to make a significant impact in the community while gaining invaluable experience in substantive and public-facing legal work. Salary will range from $60,000 to $80,000, depending upon tenure and experience. 




The Law Offices of Thiru Vignarajah is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We celebrate diversity and are dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for all staff members. 




Deadline: Applications will be accepted until the position is filled, by July 31st. We will review LinkedIn applications, but emailed applications are preferred (thiru@thirulaw.com). Please send a resume and cover letter.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location.

Your Contribution to Our Growth




We’re looking for a Data Analyst to join Aquanow’s growing team and help shape the future of data at a leading digital asset infrastructure company.

You’ll collaborate closely with our Senior Backend Engineer to turn ad hoc insights into automated, scalable reports that power decision-making across the company.




As the first and only Data Analyst on the team, you’ll have a unique opportunity to build the foundations of our data analytics function and directly influence how we leverage data to drive growth, optimize operations, and enhance the client experience.

Design, develop, and maintain analytics dashboards for stakeholders and clients, delivering real-time data visualizations and business intelligence reports.
Perform ad hoc data analysis, reporting, and data mining to support business inquiries and decision-making.
Prototype and validate reports prior to productionizing backend reporting workflows.
Work closely with engineering teams to design and implement self-service analytics tools that empower business users to independently access, analyze, and visualize data, and enhance self-serve data access tools for internal users.
Monitor and ensure that client, business, and regulatory reports adhere to established quality standards and deadlines, facilitating timely delivery of critical insights.
Act as a ""Product Owner"" for the reporting domain: manage incoming data and reporting requests, prioritize needs, and collaborate with engineering to implement scalable, automated solutions.
Identify and analyze trends and patterns in data to inform product enhancements and develop strategies for increasing client engagement.
Present findings and actionable recommendations clearly and effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, fostering understanding and supporting data-driven decision-making.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to align analytics initiatives with broader business strategies and objectives.




We’d Love to See

Demonstrated experience as a Data Analyst, preferably within the fintech industry, with a strong focus on crypto trading, payments, and brokerage services.
Proficiency in data analysis tools and programming languages such as SQL, Python, and R, along with proficiency in data visualization software (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).
Strong analytical skills and problem-solving capabilities, with a proven ability to convert complex data into actionable business insights.
Experience with creating business intelligence reports and ad-hoc analyses tailored to meet diverse client and regulatory requirements.
Experience working in Agile environments.
Proven ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams, including product management, engineering, and support.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources
Define and monitor key economic impact metrics
Go deep on understanding business drivers, user segments, cohorts and macroeconomic trends
Prepare presentations, analyses and visualizations for internal and external executive audiences
Partner closely with Communications, Policy, Marketing and Product teams to identify and analyze key trends and produce thought leadership pieces and campaign content leveraging Stripe data
Collaborate with external vendors, academics, and think tanks to advance Stripe’s research agenda and advocacy positions



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements

The Position

Uplight is creating a new category of energy. We make software that manages energy resources in homes and businesses—including things like smart thermostats, electric vehicles, solar panels, storage batteries, heat pumps, and even people’s behavior—to generate, shift, or save energy to balance the grid, making it more efficient and reliable. This creates clean energy capacity that can be used by the power grid instead of burning more fossil fuels. Our solutions accelerate the transition to clean energy and save money for energy customers.

We are seeking a Data Engineer focusing on data platform enablement to support our mission and scale our impact

How You Will Make An Impact

As a Data Engineer at Uplight, you’ll play a central role in designing and maintaining the infrastructure that ingests, transforms, and delivers data across our platform. Your work ensures that data systems are reliable, scalable, observable, and cost-efficient—forming the backbone of many customer-facing and data science-driven solutions.

You’ll partner with cross-functional teams including analysts, product managers, and data scientists to ensure the platform meets the evolving needs of our business and our users.

What You Get To Do


Design, build, and maintain data pipelines using Databricks (Spark, Delta Lake) and Python.
Collaborate across teams to develop core platform capabilities—such as orchestration, metadata management, and data quality—delivering scalable, reusable solutions
Improve reliability and fault tolerance of ingest pipelines handling large volumes of utility data.
Build and support MLOps tooling, including data pipelines, model registries, and serving infrastructure
Participate in the full software development lifecycle: design, build, test, deploy, and support
Contribute to a remote-first team that values agility, collaboration, and clarity—favoring whiteboarding, async design docs, and reflective retros over rigid ceremonies.
Continuously learn and grow with support from senior engineers and team leads
Help maintain a team culture rooted in curiosity, empathy, and continuous improvement


What You Bring To Uplight


2–5 years of software engineering experience, ideally in backend or data-focused roles
Experience with Databricks, Spark, or similar big data technologies
Proficiency in Python and SQL
Exposure to cloud platforms such as GCP or AWS
Familiarity with CI/CD tools and infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Docker, Terraform, CircleCI)
Strong communication and collaboration skills; a team player excited to learn and grow


Bonus Points


Familiarity with MLOps concepts and tools (e.g., MLflow, model versioning)
Experience with real-time or streaming data systems (e.g., Kafka, Structured Streaming)
Understanding of data observability, lineage, and quality
Prior work in the energy or utility space
Strong grasp of Big Data challenges including cost vs performance tradeoffs


Don’t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women, marginalized genders and people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification. At Uplight we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

Why Join Uplight in Leading the Fight Against Climate Change?

At Uplight, We're Not Just Offering a Job – We're Offering a Chance To Be Part Of The Solution To One Of The World's Biggest Challenges. As a Certified B Corporation, We're Deeply Committed To Both Social And Environmental Responsibility. Here's Why You Should Join Our Team Of Passionate Uplighters

■ 公司不在市中心 (但在台南高鐵站旁)。
