Coordination and supervision of the (small) TREE data management team.
Close exchange and cooperation with the survey design team and the study management, especially with regard to field preparation and data documentation.
Technical support for data users.
Networking activities to coordinate with other panel studies and promote national and international research cooperation.
Optional contributions to research based on TREE data (methodological or content-oriented).


Requirements


Experience in processing and documenting of survey data, preferably in the context of the collection of longitudinal (panel) data, and in-depth understanding of the survey data cycle. Additional experience in sampling and weighting or psychometric scaling is an advantage.
Background in survey methodology and quantitative social science research. Familiarity with the research field addressed by TREE is an advantage.
Logical and conceptual thinking, precise working style, and technical flair.
Programming experience, preferably in the context of data bases (SQL), statistical software (Stata, R, SPSS), and reporting (LaTeX).
Organizational, teamwork, networking, and communication skills, including the capability to lead a small team (two data managers and one or two student assistants).
Proficiency in (scientific) English and fluency in German or French.


We offer


Collaboration in a large and innovative panel study embedded in excellent scientific networks, both nationally and internationally.
Proficient, experienced, and supportive interdisciplinary scientific team.
Generous continuing education and training opportunities.
Salary according to University of Bern regulations.
Job location in Bern, Switzerland, one of the world's cities with the highest quality of life.

Ti attende un lavoro estremamente stimolante e variegato con interessanti opportunità di sviluppo.

Tutto tranne che ordinario

Noi, i collaboratori del Controllo federale delle finanze, lavoriamo per l'organo supremo di vigilanza finanziaria della Confederazione. Eseguiamo verifiche per accertare che l'Amministrazione impieghi le risorse federali conformemente alla legge, in modo parsimonioso ed efficace. Siamo anche il servizio indipendente di contatto offerto dalla Confederazione in materia di whistleblowing. In questo modo coadiuviamo il Parlamento e il Consiglio federale nell'esercizio del loro mandato di vigilanza sull'Amministrazione federale. Non solo abbiamo compiti straordinariamente interessanti, ma siamo anche un datore di lavoro straordinario. Poiché lavorando per noi contribuisci al successo del modello elvetico. Operi verifiche attente e garantisci che i soldi dei contribuenti siano impiegati in modo efficiente. Siamo un'organizzazione con una struttura chiara e una gerarchia piatta. Qui incontrerai altre 140 menti brillanti con biografie interessanti con cui collaborerai nell'ambito di progetti complessi. Lavorare in questo modo dà molte soddisfazioni! Effettuiamo oltre 150 verifiche all'anno in piccoli team composti ad hoc di volta in volta. Nel quadro di questa attività affrontiamo sempre nuove sfide e verifichiamo l'approccio a temi che concernono da vicino la Svizzera. Oltre ad ampie conoscenze specialistiche e una buona cultura generale sono necessarie anche una buona dose di intuizione e di curiosità.

Che cosa offriamo

Lavorare per la Svizzera: Ci adoperiamo per il modello di successo svizzero e lavoriamo per il benessere della popolazione.

Vivere la diversità: La concretizzazione delle pari opportunità ci consente di esprimere al meglio le nostre competenze e di contemplare punti di vista differenti.

As Staff Data Scientist for Linktree’s Core Product Analytics team, you’ll be responsible for planning, launching and evaluating a wide range of experiments in our growth / saas revenue product. These experiments will help Linktree test key hypotheses, and will unlock impactful new opportunities for our tens of millions of users and our billions of visitors around the world. Most of all, they’ll help Linktree achieve our mission: To empower anyone to curate and grow their digital universe.

You’ll design smart, scrappy experiments that help us collect directional signals quickly, and you’ll also orchestrate more formal hypothesis tests that give us deeper insights on our most important ideas. In both cases, you’ll help us learn quickly by working in lean, build-measure-learn cycles.

You’ll be part of a cross-functional team of engineers, product managers, product designers and data scientists, fostering cross-discipline collaborations to achieve impressive results. You’ll work across a broad range of modern statistical techniques, and you’ll communicate your findings in a way that’s easy for your team-mates to understand. You’ll also mentor our other Data Scientists, drawing on your considerable professional experience to help distil best practices and drive their development.

You’ll work 3 days per week from our LA or SF office (you can choose which!), and 2 days per week from home.

What You'll Do


You’ll design, implement, monitor and evaluate a wide range of experiments to help us test key hypotheses and learn from our users;
You’ll distil insights that you share widely throughout the company, and that inform our future product direction;
You’ll build and own important datasets that quantify key aspects of our core product and our users’ behaviour, and you’ll mentor your team-mates on how best to use these datasets to drive impact, especially in B2C SaaS monetization and consumer growth analytics
You’ll monitor key metrics for our core product, and collaborate with your team-mates to ensure we’re making good progress towards our business goals;
You’ll mentor other Data Scientists and share your deep expertise of your craft;
You’ll stay up-to-date with the latest developments in data science, to ensure we’re always operating at the cutting-edge;
You’ll contribute to our overall data strategy, ensuring we remain competitive and innovative;
You’ll evangelise best practices for data and statistics, and drive adoption across the company.


Who We're Looking For


You have at least 6 years of relevant experience as a Data Scientist in a high-growth, product-centric technology company;
You have direct experience with consumer-facing SaaS products and driving experiments that optimize B2C revenue growth (e.g., subscriptions, freemium to paid conversion, pricing, churn reduction);
You have hands-on experience of driving a wide range experiments, from quick-and-scrappy “spikes” to more formal hypothesis tests;
You have at least a Bachelor’s Degree in mathematics, statistics, physics, computer science, or a related discipline (a Master’s Degree or PhD is a bonus);
You have clear experience of using data to drive business impact;
You thrive in a fast-paced, agile product development environment;
You have experience using “build-measure-learn” cycles to ship quickly, iterate and derive powerful insights;
You can work from our LA or SF office 3 days per week.

Our Story

We’re on a mission to empower anyone to curate, grow, and monetize their digital universe. We created the “link in bio” category — and we’re just getting started. From creators, artists, and entrepreneurs to global brands, we’re redefining how people connect with their communities, showcase their content and promote products — all in one link.

Today, a community of 70+ million use Linktree, including icons like Adidas, TikTok, the UN Environmental Program, The NFL, Manchester United, World Central Kitchen, Sabrina Carpenter, Olivia Rodrigo, and Selena Gomez. With 48,000 new accounts created every day, Linktree is the fastest-growing leader in our space.

We’ve teamed up with some of the world’s biggest platforms including TikTok, Snap, YouTube, GoFundMe, Spotify, Google, Stripe, Reddit, Laylo, and Kajabi, to unify Linkers’ digital spaces, and we partner with retail brands Amazon, Lululemon, Nike, Target, Sephora, Lululemon, and more to share products they love.

We’re a tight-knit, passionate team building best-in-class tools that make online presence simple, powerful, and yours. If you're excited by the idea of shaping a new category, setting the standard, and making space for everyone to be seen and succeed, we’d love to meet you.

Where And How We Work

We're a global, diverse team spread across continents with offices in London, Los Angeles, Melbourne, and San Francisco. We work together flexibly and you can choose the setup that works best for you: fully remote or a hybrid mix of office and home.

We offer autonomy in how you structure your days and weeks. While we’re mindful of time zones and occasionally collaborate outside the typical 9–5, we lean into async work to keep things flowing. Our culture is family-friendly and Zoom-casual where kids, pets, and delivery drivers are welcome.

100% coverage (and 80% for your dependents) of your monthly premiums for medical, dental, vision, disability and life insurance for US-based employees.
Employer contribution towards your retirement.
Generous time off for vacation, holidays, parental leave, volunteer time, and other categories.
Employee stock option program - we want each and every employee to share in the company’s success.


At Linktree, we believe in promoting a culture that celebrates unique backgrounds, talents, and experiences, and we’re proud to be an equal opportunity workplace. We are creating an inclusive workplace where every individual feels valued, respected, and has equal opportunities to thrive. We aim to foster a diverse and inclusive environment where all team members have a sense of belonging. Linktree welcomes all people regardless of sex, gender identity, race, ethnicity, disability, pregnancy, age, or other lived experience.

Backed by $128MM in funding from investors like Valor Equity Partners (an early investor in Tesla and SpaceX), we launched the world’s first-to-market AI-powered robotic massage experience with Equinox in August 2024 and quickly went viral: WIRED, Fast Company, Popular Science, Sports Business Journal, Fortune, Vogue and Bloomberg are only some of the leading publications that have covered our technology, with celebs like Will Smith posting about us.

Since then, we’ve announced partnerships with global industry leaders across hospitality, pro sports, corporate wellness, and luxury real estate — with more on the horizon as we supercharge growth.

Create analytics platforms that provide insights into utilization patterns, user satisfaction, and system performance across our enterprise partner network.
Implement data solutions that enable our rapid scaling while maintaining data quality and supporting real-time operational decision-making.


What You’ll Bring


3+ years of experience in data engineering, with strong expertise in Python, SQL, and cloud-based data pipeline development (AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, DBT, etc).
Experience building automated data systems handling large volumes of data from IoT devices, robotics platforms, or real-time operational environments.
Experience building both streaming and batch data processing pipelines.
Experience building data systems for AI driven use cases - vector database, RAG tooling, MCP servers to access data, etc.
A solid background in data warehousing, ETL/ELT processes, and analytics infrastructure for business intelligence. Experience building transformation and data quality monitoring pipelines using tools like DBT or Databricks DLT.
An understanding of data requirements for machine learning applications and experience supporting algorithm development teams.
Proven ability to work with cross-functional teams in fast-paced environments where data drives critical business decisions.


What’s In It For You


Join a trailblazing tech company anticipated to transform the massage industry
The chance to make a difference with a product that empowers healthier and happier living
Team culture driven by passion, ambition, empowerment, inclusion, curiosity, and fun!
We’ll grow together – your personal and professional growth are equally important

Annual Salary Range: $92,960- $123,943

FLSA Exempt / Union Represented

This position allows for up to four days of remote work per week




Short Description

The Office of Admissions seeks a Program Analyst in the Los Angeles office. The salary for this position is $92,960 - $123,943. This position allows for up to four days of remote work per week. The role will be critical in ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the expanded Provisional Licensure Program. We are seeking a highly motivated, analytical, detail-oriented professional to join our team. This key position will ensure the integrity and accuracy of the recently expanded Provisional Licensure Program by independently reviewing and assessing documentation for eligibility and compliance with governing rules and established guidelines.




About the Office

The Office of Admissions (Admissions) oversees all activities pertaining to admitting attorneys to practice law in California. Admissions oversees the administration of the California State Bar Exam, First-Year Law Students’ Exam, and the Legal Specialization Exams. Admissions conduct applicant moral character investigations, accreditation, and registrations of non-ABA law schools. Applicant fees, accreditation fees, and interest income fund the Admissions office. Admissions also processes special admissions applications for attorneys who are licensed in another state to work in unique capacities in California.




Admissions is also responsible for California's uniquely diverse pathways to the law. It supports the Committee of Bar Examiners (CBE) in accrediting California-accredited law schools and registering unaccredited law schools. They administer a program that allows lawyers licensed in other jurisdictions or law students to practice in certain defined, limited areas and programs to certify specialists in 13 legal practice areas. In 2020, Admissions developed a new program for the provisional licensure of recent law graduates and others.




About the Position

The Office of Admissions seeks a highly motivated, analytical, detail-oriented professional to join our team as a Program Analyst. This position is key in ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the recently expanded Provisional Licensure Program by independently reviewing and assessing documentation for eligibility and compliance with governing rules and established guidelines. The Program Analyst will ensure timely and accurate application processing, monitor and audit applicant requirements compliance, and adhere to the statutory deadlines. A strong ability to adhere to policies and apply them accurately is essential. The Program Analyst may be required to prepare reports analyzing trends within the program, distilling survey responses, evaluating the program's effectiveness, researching similar programs in other jurisdictions and professions, and recommending internal efficiencies. The role will also assist with preparing agenda items for the Committee of Bar Examiners (CBE).




Success in this role requires the ideal candidate to demonstrate sound judgment, maintain confidentiality, and consistently make responsible decisions in complex or sensitive situations, all while approaching challenges with a proactive, solutions-focused mindset. The ability to communicate effectively, verbally and in writing, is critical, as the role requires explaining deliverables clearly and communicating with applicants, management, and external stakeholders. Experience analyzing and summarizing qualitative and quantitative data to identify trends and make recommendations to leadership team members, as well as familiarity with Salesforce or other Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool are essential to the position.

In addition to the core responsibilities, this position will assist with tasks in both the Special Admissions and Eligibility Units, as needed, and will be part of the team responsible for administering the California Bar Examination and the First-Year Law Students’ Examination, requiring overnight travel up to four times a year. The role demands a proactive and organized professional who thrives in a fast-paced environment, maintains a high standard of accuracy in their work, and consistently resolves issues with clarity and confidence. This role is a meaningful opportunity to contribute to a mission-driven team dedicated to supporting applicants and ensuring an efficient and equitable admissions process.

Are you passionate about improving our environment for this generation and those to follow? Are you ready to take on new challenges and collaborate with a future-focused team leading the way into new markets? Join Nexamp! 

This is where you can learn from industry leaders and become one yourself. It's fast-paced, mission-based work that challenges the status quo. Be on the team that's changing the world. 

What we’re looking for: 

We're looking for a Lead Data Analyst to craft insightful and compelling data stories, empower business owners across Nexamp to make more effective data-driven decisions, and help build our self-service data platform. As one of the nation’s largest and longest tenured solar and storage owner operators – and one of the few that is fully vertically integrated – our data is a differentiator in the market and a catalyst for future growth. You’ll be solving uniquely challenging data problems, alongside a strong team, and for a company in which the business model and mission are inseparably intertwined: our solar farms save customers money, help the planet, and are profitable for Nexamp and its investors. 

This role will be hybrid, based out of our Boston office, and you will report to the Director of Product, Data.

What you’ll do:  

Own and Deliver Data Products: Independently gather requirements for, prioritize, deliver, maintain, and continuously improve reusable data models, dashboards, analyses, A/B tests, and other data assets. Act as the product manager and implementer for your domain’s data offerings. Implement work using advanced SQL and BI tool skills. 
Be a Trusted Data Partner: Become the subject matter expert for data in your business areas. Identify opportunities for impact, proactively surface insights, support decision-making, and contribute to and influence business strategy and initiatives. Serve as your business stakeholders’ right hand. Support other business areas opportunistically.
Drive Data Quality, Documentation, and Engineering: Create and maintain comprehensive data documentation and communicate updates to your stakeholders. Write user stories or tickets for data engineering, validate data mapping, conduct QA, and implement data quality monitoring.
Foster Data Culture and Adoption: Monitor the usage of data assets, increase data literacy, and promote self-service through BI tools among stakeholders. Provide training, guidance, and support as needed.  
Collaborate Across the Data Team: Work within a centralized data team using agile methodologies. Collaborate with peer analysts through overlapping work, priority shifting, and code reviews to broaden your Nexamp knowledge.
Influence Data Strategy: Partner with the data architect, engineers, scientists, and analysts to shape the vision and roadmap for Nexamp’s data platform. Define and track annual OKRs to measure your impact.  

What you’ll bring: 

5-7 years of experience as a data analyst serving business owners and collaborating with data engineers (experience in the energy/construction industry is a plus, but not required) 
Advanced in SQL and BI tool administration and usage (experience with Databricks and Sigma are a plus, but not required) 
Strong track record of independently solving problems.
Commitment to Nexamp's mission and have a passion for solving tomorrow's climate crisis today.
Demonstrated experience in effectively communicating information, ideas, and perspectives with people inside and beyond your organization.   
Experience in showcasing initiative to make improvements to current work, processes, products, and services across the organization. We value accountability and an ownership mentality. 
Ability to ask appropriate questions, analyze data, identify the root causes of problems, and present creative solutions. 
Expertise in building strong internal and external relationships with customers and stakeholders, instilling trust and loyalty across the industry. 
Eagerness to develop a fundamental understanding of how Nexamp operates and then apply that knowledge effectively to inform business decisions.  

If you don’t meet 100% of the above qualifications, but see yourself contributing, please apply.

At Nexamp, our mission is to build the future of energy so it is clean, simple, and accessible for all. We are committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, veteran status, or any other basis protected by law. By encouraging a culture where ideas and decisions come from all people, we believe it will help us grow, innovate, and be a part of environmental and social change.

You’ll love working here because:  

Not only will you get to take part in meaningful work and have the chance to change the world alongside innovative, dedicated, and motivated peers, but you will also have access to all the benefits that Nexamp offers! This includes our competitive compensation package; a 401(k) employer-match; health, dental, and vision insurance starting day one; flexible paid time off and holiday PTO; commuter benefits, and cell phone reimbursement. We have headquarters in Boston, MA and Chicago, IL, in addition to growing offices nationwide. We provide healthy snacks, coffee, service days and other volunteer opportunities, company outings, and more!  

Nexamp's People team manages all aspects of recruitment and hiring within our organization. We want to inform third-party recruiters, staffing firms, and related agencies that Nexamp does not accept unsolicited resumes. Resumes will only be considered from these entities if a signed agreement is in place and the People team explicitly authorizes external recruiting assistance for a specific position. Any unsolicited resumes received will be deemed the property of Nexamp. We want to emphasize that Nexamp is not liable for any fees associated with unsolicited resumes.

Job Description

CyberArk is seeking a Senior Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst with a passion for sales strategy and business insight to join our Business Analytics team. In this role, you will act as a strategic partner to Sales and Sales Operations leaders around the globe—translating data into compelling narratives that drive better, faster decisions. You’ll play a key role in shaping how performance is measured, understood, and improved across our global go-to-market (GTM) organization. While you’ll contribute to dashboard development and scalable reporting in Tableau, this role goes far beyond building reports—you’ll be expected to uncover trends, connect dots across complex datasets, and communicate insights in a way that resonates with non-technical audiences. The ideal candidate is a business-minded analyst with strong sales acumen, excellent communication skills, and an instinct for asking the right questions to get to the heart of the problem.

Responsibilities:



Serve as an embedded analytics partner to global Sales and Sales Operations stakeholders, proactively identifying opportunities to improve pipeline, productivity, and conversion
Craft clear, executive-ready narratives based on deep-dive analyses of sales performance, pipeline coverage, segmentation, and revenue trends
Translate complex data and technical concepts into actionable recommendations that are easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand and act upon
Design and evolve self-service dashboards and tools in Tableau that reduce friction and enable faster time-to-decision
Maintain a high bar for data accuracy and consistency across reports and ad hoc deliverables
Collaborate cross-functionally with Sales, RevOps, Marketing, Finance, and IT to align on business definitions and ensure reliable analytics infrastructure
Help drive a data-driven culture by enabling stakeholders to interpret KPIs and use insights effectively



Qualifications



4–6 years of experience in Sales Analytics, Sales Operations, Business Intelligence, or a related field
Proven ability to extract and communicate insights from complex data—especially in a Sales or GTM environment
Strong business judgment, with experience working directly with senior stakeholders and cross-functional teams
Working knowledge of SQL and experience with Tableau or a similar BI platform (depth of tool expertise less important than the ability to learn quickly)
Understanding of B2B sales metrics, pipeline stages, and CRM data (Salesforce experience a plus)
Excellent storytelling skills—both written and verbal—with the ability to tailor messages to executive and frontline audiences
Self-starter who thrives in a fast-paced, dynamic environment and isn’t afraid to ask questions or challenge assumptions
Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative or business-related field
Smart, bold but humble attitude to work collaboratively with CyberArk colleagues



Additional Information

CyberArk is an Equal Opportunity Employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or protected Veteran status.

We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of employment Visa at this time.

The salary range for this position is $87,000 – $121,000/year, plus commissions or discretionary bonus, which will be based on the employee’s performance. Base pay may also vary considerably depending on job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. The compensation package includes a wide range of medical, dental, vision, financial, and other benefits.
