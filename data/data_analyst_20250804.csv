You’ll support feasibility analyses, quickly summarize patient populations, and assist in identifying and tracking data issues. This position is ideal for someone with hands-on experience working with EHR or healthcare data, strong data wrangling skills, and a passion for translating data into actionable insights.

Responsibilities

Collaborate with success managers and support team to ensure that Truveta partners can be successful with the platform.
Provide technical analytics support and directly work with customers on calls to troubleshoot code and platform questions.
Work with customers to achieve their goals, teaching them how to wrangle and analyze data using SQL, R and Python on RWD to address their empirical questions.
Collaborate closely with other Truveta teams to conduct investigations of data sources to demonstrate veracity to current customers.
Deliver feedback to internal teams based on customer requests to inform Truveta’s product roadmap.


Required Skills


Undergraduate or graduate level educational in clinical research, data analysis, clinical informatics or related field.
Experience working with large relational database consisting of millions of patients' data.
2+ years of experience wrangling and analyzing Electronic Health Record data or other Real World Data sources in life science companies, CROs, other EHR data companies or healthcare using SQL, R and Python.
Knowledge of clinical terminologies such as ICD, SNOMED, LOINC, NDC or RxNorm.
Willingness to learn new coding languages including internal proprietary coding language to analyze data and build cohorts.
Experience working with customers delivering high quality research analyses.
Ability to learn and adapt quickly in a dynamic start-up environment.


Preferred Qualifications

These qualifications are preferred but not required, please do not let them stop you from applying for this role. You will likely get the opportunity to learn how to do these more advanced analyses if you don’t already have experience with them.


Experience working with unstructured clinical data or natural language processing outputs
Spark/PySpark experience
Regex query writing experience
Experience building cohort definitions or eligibility criteria for research studies or trial design

Working Conditions:

At the heart of our company is a belief in the power of in-person collaboration. Being together in the office fuels our creativity, strengthens our connections, and drives the innovation that sets us apart. Our culture is built on spontaneous moments—those hallway conversations, whiteboard brainstorms, and shared celebrations in each of our global offices—that simply can’t be replicated remotely. This role is expected to be in the office 5 days a week.

The job conditions for this position are in a standard office setting. Employees in this position use PC and phone on an on-going basis throughout the day. Limited corporate travel may be required to remote offices or other business meetings and events.

Life At PB:

We are consistently recognized as a Best Place to Work and our culture is at the heart of our success. It’s our fundamental belief that people do and create great things and that people are the cornerstone of prosperity. We believe that proactively seeking out different points of view, listening to others, learning, and reflecting on what we’ve heard creates a sense of belonging within PitchBook and strengthens the PitchBook community.

We are excited to get to know you and your background. Concerned that you might not meet every requirement? We encourage you to still apply as you might be the right candidate for the role or other roles at PitchBook.

At the heart of our company is a belief in the power of in-person collaboration. Being together in the office fuels our creativity, strengthens our connections, and drives the innovation that sets us apart. Our culture is built on spontaneous moments—those hallway conversations, whiteboard brainstorms, and shared celebrations in each of our global offices—that simply can’t be replicated remotely. This role is expected to be in the office 5 days a week.

The job conditions for this position are in a standard office setting. Employees in this position use PC and phone on an on-going basis throughout the day. Limited corporate travel may be required to remote offices or other business meetings and events.

Life At PB:

We are consistently recognized as a Best Place to Work and our culture is at the heart of our success. It’s our fundamental belief that people do and create great things and that people are the cornerstone of prosperity. We believe that proactively seeking out different points of view, listening to others, learning, and reflecting on what we’ve heard creates a sense of belonging within PitchBook and strengthens the PitchBook community.

We are excited to get to know you and your background. Concerned that you might not meet every requirement? We encourage you to still apply as you might be the right candidate for the role or other roles at PitchBook.
