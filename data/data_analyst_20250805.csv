About us:

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The best choice for anyone who takes investing seriously:

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

Technical & Mentorship Leadership: Contribute significantly to the growth and development of fellow product analysts through knowledge sharing sessions, best practice dissemination, workflow optimizations, and active participation in hiring and onboarding processes. Champion and drive analytical excellence within the team and broader organization.

Expertise in statistical methods applied to experimental design (A/B testing, multivariate tests, etc.), causal inference, and robust hypothesis validation. You should be able to navigate complex statistical challenges and explain methodologies clearly.
Extensive experience working with large-scale user behavior data (e.g., transactional, clickstream, app usage), including data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to derive actionable insights.
Proficiency with at least one data visualization tool such as Looker Studio (Data Studio), Tableau, QlikView, or Power BI, with a proven ability to create compelling and insightful dashboards.
Demonstrated ability to influence and collaborate with multiple stakeholders, including senior product managers, engineers, and business leaders.

This PE-backed platform delivers inspection, maintenance, and installation services across fire and life safety systems, with a primary focus on the marine sector‚Äîserving commercial vessels, private yachts, cruise lines, and military ships. With operations in Oakland, Fort Lauderdale, and Los Angeles, the business is actively transitioning from marine dominance to expanding into commercial and industrial real estate fire safety services. The company has completed three acquisitions since September 2024, with ambitions to build a national platform through both M&A and organic growth.

The platform currently generates $20M in revenue with $3.3M in YTD EBITDA and a goal to reach $5M EBITDA by year-end. The long-term vision is to scale to $15‚Äì$20M EBITDA and achieve a strategic or sponsor-backed exit.




THE PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM

The firm is a first-time fund with $100M AUM, pursuing control buyouts and aggressive buy-and-build strategies across Industrials, Business Services, and Healthcare. Their investment thesis centers on professionalizing founder-led businesses and scaling platforms through focused M&A and operational improvement. The firm is hands-on early in the hold and highly supportive in execution. They invest in people, not just assets.

Other portfolio businesses include HVAC services and fire safety platforms. The team is based in Los Angeles and is deeply involved in strategy and execution‚Äîstepping in when needed and stepping back once teams are built.




THE CULTURE

The platform is in the early stages of cultural transformation. Historically founder-led and location-centric, the business is moving from a fractured C-grade culture toward a cohesive, mission-driven environment. Pride exists at the field level, particularly in marine services, but there is a strong need for leadership to instill structure, values, and accountability.

The CEO will be instrumental in driving this cultural shift‚Äîdeveloping leadership, building an outbound sales motion, professionalizing service delivery, and establishing core business functions such as HR and strategic operations.

Driving organic growth initiatives including outbound sales and commercial expansion.
Professionalizing all business functions: HR, service delivery, finance, and operations.
Representing the platform to the board and investors.




KEY SELLING POINTS OF THE ROLE

Lead a growing platform in a $68.5Bn+ market with strong M&A momentum.
Opportunity to build and own the story of a sponsor-backed roll-up.
High equity upside‚Äîaligned directly with the sponsor's contribution.
Supportive and execution-driven board with track record of value creation.
Be the face of a future $20M EBITDA exit with strategic and sponsor interest already validated.




KEY CHALLENGES FOR THE ROLE

First-time PE-backed business‚Äîrequires pace, structure, and vision.
Fragmented operations and inconsistent professionalism across sites.
Low process maturity‚Äîrequires hands-on transformation.
Marine sector complexity requires sensitivity to safety, regulation, and nuance.
Building trust and alignment across legacy leadership and new team.




YOUR BACKGROUND

Buy-and-build experience‚Äîdeal sourcing, diligence, and integration.

London | Hybrid

¬£50‚Äì60k + benefits




Join a well-backed, growing bank in the middle of a major transformation - modernising its systems, launching new business lines, and putting data at the centre of it all.




This is a chance for a hands-on Data Analyst to make a real impact. You'll work closely with business teams, shape how data is used across the bank, and help build the foundations of a more data-driven culture.




If you're looking to grow your career while doing meaningful work - not just pulling reports - this could be a great fit.




What You‚Äôll Be Doing

Work with stakeholders across the business (Risk, Compliance, Change) to understand and solve real-world data problems
Clean, validate, and reconcile data from multiple systems, including core banking and CRM
Support data migration efforts as the bank upgrades and modernises its platforms
Contribute to shaping data governance and improving data quality across the organisation
Ensure reporting data meets internal governance and compliance standards
Be part of the wider transformation journey, helping the bank scale its data maturity




Essential Skills

Strong SQL skills
Experience working with multiple relational databases (e.g. SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres)
Awareness of data modelling concepts
Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail
Ability to work with non-technical stakeholders and explain complex data clearly
Proactive, organised, and comfortable working in a fast-changing environment




Desirable Skills

Familiarity with BI tools like Power BI or Tableau
Basic Python or scripting for data manipulation
Understanding of ETL pipelines or data flows
Experience with core banking or financial systems
Exposure to cloud-based platforms (e.g. Azure)
Awareness of regulatory frameworks like GDPR or BCBS239




Why This Role Stands Out

Backed by a major European bank ‚Äì stability + long-term growth
Transformation in motion ‚Äì new leadership, new systems, and a clear modernisation plan
Big impact, small team ‚Äì get visibility, influence change, and work closely with senior decision-makers
Supportive environment ‚Äì strong team culture, mentoring, and variety in the work
Hybrid working ‚Äì 3 days in the office based in a brand-new central London office




If you‚Äôre a data analyst who enjoys making sense of complex data and wants to play a part in shaping the future of a growing bank - we‚Äôd love to hear from you. Apply today!

The company has completed three acquisitions since September 2024, with ambitions to build a national platform through both M&A and organic growth.

We‚Äôre building the digital backbone of an industry the world relies on. Metals and raw materials are essential to our modern world, from infrastructure and manufacturing to electric vehicles and renewable energy. Yet procurement, sales and trading in this sector remains manual, opaque, and inefficient. We‚Äôre changing that. Our platform gives industrial buyers and suppliers the tools to work smarter with greater transparency, faster execution, and more resilient supply chains.




By streamlining processes and making them fit for the future, we‚Äôre supporting an industry that underpins economic progress and a greener future.

To do it right, we need data ‚Äì clean, reliable, insightful data. That‚Äôs where you come in. Your mission is to turn raw numbers into real impact, helping us ‚Äì and our customers ‚Äì make smarter decisions, faster.




Your mission

This position is a¬†hybrid role,¬†with 2 days per week in our D√ºsseldorf office.




You‚Äôll work side-by-side with Lion, our Data Team Lead, as well as teams across the whole company, such as Customer Success, Software Development and Sales. From building dashboards in Tableau to digging into databases and spotting trends, you‚Äôll help us unlock the full value of our data.




Your skillset

You‚Äôre fluent in¬†SQL¬†and experienced in working with relational¬†databases
Tableau experience is a must-have ‚Äî you know how to build dashboards that are both visually compelling and rich in actionable insights.
You have a degree in¬†Data Science, Statistics, or a similar quantitative field
You‚Äôve worked with¬†Python,¬†R, or other analytical tools
You‚Äôre structured, precise, and curious ‚Äì you don‚Äôt just crunch numbers, you ask why and consult back
Bonus: you‚Äôve worked in a¬†B2B SaaS¬†or¬†startup environment¬†and are used to moving fast
Fluent in English ‚Äì German is a plus




What your day-to-day looks like

Create reports and visualizations that make insights crystal clear ‚Äì especially in Tableau.
Explore and analyze large datasets to uncover patterns and guide business decisions.
Ensure data is reliable and clean by performing data quality checks.
Support teams with ad-hoc data requests and deep-dives that help us move fast.
Structure and maintain databases that power everything from KPIs to customer insights.
Collaborate with stakeholders to define metrics that actually matter ‚Äì not just nice-to-haves.
You‚Äôll make sure that what we measure is meaningful ‚Äì and that everyone can act on it.




How success looks like

You deliver accurate, timely, and reliable reports that stakeholders trust to make informed decisions.
You proactively identify trends, patterns, and opportunities that lead to measurable business improvements.
Business decisions are backed by data ‚Äì and you made that possible by enabling our customers and creating solutions that focus on what truly matters to them.
You collaborate effectively across teams, translating data into clear, actionable insights for both technical and non-technical audiences.¬†

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You‚Äôll leverage advanced BigQuery features‚Äîsuch as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis‚Äîto ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won‚Äôt be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements

Remote (+/- 4.5 hours from Pacific Time) or in-lab (Surrey, BC, Canada)
Compensation: CAD $80k-95k plus options, based on your skills, qualifications and level of relevant experience
Benefits package
Support for professional development




Who we‚Äôre looking for:

We are seeking a skilled Data Integration Specialist with strong enterprise coding abilities and experience handling large volumes of diverse datasets. You should be comfortable working with clients to understand their data landscape and technical constraints, mapping data to our platform, and developing robust, scalable data pipelines. We value teammates who are collaborative, detail-oriented, and proactive in troubleshooting and improving data processes. You would relish a position where your work will play a key role in enabling the global transition to clean energy, supporting a more sustainable future.




Key qualities:

Strong enterprise coding skills (Python preferred)
Strong data munging skills
Experience with libraries and technologies for processing large datasets in a wide variety of formats (CSV, parquet, JSON, XML, GDB, etc.)
Strong data privacy and security mindset and habits
Good SQL proficiency
Experience with cloud storage tools (e.g. AWS S3, Azure Blob, etc.)
Excellent communication and client interaction skills
Willingness to travel for client engagements as needed (Awesense has business globally)
Problem-solving mindset and ability to work in a team environment

Nice-to-have:

Familiarity with geospatial, network, or time series data and/or electrical-utility data is a plus
Experience with cloud provider data pipeline management tools (e.g. AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory, Apache Airflow, etc.) and overall cloud analytics platforms (e.g. Azure Fabric)
Experience using software in containers (e.g. Docker)
Familiarity with data science notebooks (e.g. Jupyter)




Who we are:

Our goal is to transform the planet into one that is fuelled by modern, reliable and clean energy.¬† For over a decade we‚Äôve helped utilities & energy providers optimize and modernize their grid through our cloud-based grid analytics solutions.




The problem we‚Äôre solving:

The electrical grid was designed for a one-way flow of energy, with generation at the top and consumption at the edges. To enable clean energy on the scale required to address climate change (decarbonization), the grid of tomorrow needs to allow for distributed energy sources (DERs), in the form of clean generation (e.g. solar), storage (e.g. batteries) and electric vehicles, that can reside anywhere in the grid (decentralization). To achieve that, digitalization is key. Many disparate data sources must be brought together and their validity ensured so that smart-grid applications can be built on top.¬† At Awesense, we have built some of these applications ourselves. Our current goal is providing a digital layer via an API-based energy data platform so that other solution providers, partners, and even energy companies can easily build such applications on top of it ‚Äì and performance at scale is paramount. We want you to help with this as part of our services team.




Main responsibilities:
Client Engagement:
Talk with clients to understand what data they collect‚Äîincluding geospatial, graph/network, and time series data‚Äîin which systems, and how it can be extracted.
Identify data relationships and constraints, and business rules that must be enforced.
Determine the best way to map the client‚Äôs data to the Awesense data model, cross-referencing the different data types.
Data Integration Development:
Write code to retrieve data from source or intermediate systems.
Validate data against defined constraints.
Transform and cross-link data according to the mapping and prepare for ingestion.
Call Awesense REST APIs to push data into the platform.
Use Awesense REST & SQL APIs to retrieve, cross-reference, or validate previously ingested data.
Pipeline Management:
Develop code for both one-time ingestion and, importantly, ongoing data ingestion pipelines.
Ensure code is robust to errors and provides comprehensive logging and reporting.
Monitor, troubleshoot, and improve data pipelines.
Collaboration:
Work with teammates for code review and quality assurance.




What you‚Äôll assist with:
Work with the client manager to report issues back to clients and iterate on solutions as needed.
Help improve data integration processes and tools.
When not working on client projects, assist either with platform development or implementing use cases on top of the platform APIs

Ôªø

What you‚Äôll learn:
Problems and emerging solutions around grid decarbonization and the future-of-energy analytics sector.




What steps to expect once joining us:
First 3 months - onboarding, learning and first hands-on development
Meet your teammates and understand the company culture and workflows.
Learn about the Awesense domain and platform, data model, and REST/SQL APIs.
Alongside an existing Awesense team member, begin working on a client project to understand their data sources and integration needs and develop initial code for data mapping and transformation for ingestions.
Participate in code reviews and receive feedback to align with team standards.
By 6 months - expanded responsibilities
Take ownership of ongoing data ingestion pipelines, ensuring robustness and reliability.
Implement comprehensive logging, error handling, and monitoring solutions for data pipelines.
Report issues and progress to clients, iterating on solutions as needed.
Work closely with teammates on QA processes and contribute to improving integration workflows.
Deepen expertise in handling large datasets, especially geospatial, network, and time series data, and cloud-based integration solutions.
By 1 year- full project ownership:
Lead complex ongoing data integration projects from client onboarding to deployment and maintenance.
Proactively identify opportunities to optimize data pipelines and improve platform integration.
Support and mentor junior team members, sharing best practices and coding standards.
Collaborate with product and engineering teams to influence future platform features and data capabilities.
Become a key technical advisor on data integration matters.
