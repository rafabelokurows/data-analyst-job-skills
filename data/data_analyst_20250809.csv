About DoorDash

At DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.

DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Above and beyond discrimination and harassment based on “protected categories,” we also strive to prevent other subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (i.e., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at DoorDash. We value a diverse workforce – people who identify as women, non-binary or gender non-conforming, LGBTQIA+, American Indian or Native Alaskan, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, differently-abled, caretakers and parents, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply.

At the heart of our company is a belief in the power of in-person collaboration. Being together in the office fuels our creativity, strengthens our connections, and drives the innovation that sets us apart. Our culture is built on spontaneous moments—those hallway conversations, whiteboard brainstorms, and shared celebrations in each of our global offices—that simply can’t be replicated remotely. This role is expected to be in the office 5 days a week.

The job conditions for this position are in a standard office setting. Employees in this position use PC and phone on an on-going basis throughout the day. Limited corporate travel may be required to remote offices or other business meetings and events.

It’s our fundamental belief that people do and create great things and that people are the cornerstone of prosperity. We believe that proactively seeking out different points of view, listening to others, learning, and reflecting on what we’ve heard creates a sense of belonging within PitchBook and strengthens the PitchBook community.

We are excited to get to know you and your background. Concerned that you might not meet every requirement? We encourage you to still apply as you might be the right candidate for the role or other roles at PitchBook.

As a Product Analyst, you will have the opportunity to develop, test, launch and scale member banking experience products. Through experimentation, user behavioral analysis, sophisticated statistical and data science modeling, and dashboards development, you will surface product insights and recommendations that will increase adoption, engagement, and retention of our members.

In this role, you will work closely with product managers, user research, engineers, product & lifecycle marketing, and operational stakeholders to foster a data-driven product development culture, advise our product roadmaps, and build a deep understanding of member behavior.

The base salary offered for this role and level of experience will begin at $124,600 USD and go up to $155,800 USD. Full-time employees are also eligible for a bonus, competitive equity package, and benefits. The actual base salary offered may be higher, depending on your location, skills, qualifications, and experience.

In this role, you can expect to


Keep a pulse on performance metrics and KPIs. You will be positioned to have a view of the business, product, and member base and encouraged to understand and explain trends.
Foster a data-driven, test-and-learn culture with your passion for telling stories with data - not only surfacing insights but also presenting those insights and recommendations to encourage and inspire change.
Partner widely with product, engineering, research, and design to translate your insights to guide product development. You’ll use data to help the organization understand how members are interacting with Chime and convert that to business and experience implications.
Lead experimentation by providing mentorship on how they should be run, defining success metrics and data requirements, evaluating impact, and providing strategic direction.
Advise roadmap, analysis and metric ideation, and strategic discussions with stakeholders.
Collaborate with analysts and other functions to help bridge business questions and technical (data / computational) solutions.


To thrive in this role, you have


4+ years in data-focused roles (post-internship), building analytical infrastructure and data tools that support a wide audience and facilitate decisions of trade-offs. B2C product analytics and FinTech experience preferred.
Expertise in SQL - you innately translate business questions to queries, understand the edge cases of joins, and can explore a warehouse to find data most appropriate to the problem.
Familiarity in R or python - you write reproducible code and have a tendency toward automation.
Experience leading experimentation, statistical analysis, and sophisticated measurement (e.g. causal inference) E2E to guide decision making.
Hands-on experience with BI/Visualization tools (Looker, Tableau, PowerBI, etc).
Experience building metric frameworks to understand user behaviors.
Ability to think holistically to solve business problems at hand and navigate through ambiguity.
Excellent stakeholder managements skills, with a record of working cross-functionally to achieve results.
A focus on impact - you don’t stop with just recommendations but ensure to see work through to changing the business.


A Little About Us

Whether it's starting a savings account, purchasing a first car or home, launching a business, or pursuing higher education, we're proud to have helped millions unlock their financial potential.

We're a team of problem solvers, dreamers, and builders with one shared obsession: our members. From day one, Chimers have worked tirelessly to out-hustle and out-execute competitors to bring our mission to life. Their grit and determination inspire us to work harder every day to deliver the very best experience possible.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $167,300 - $251,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

High Quality. True quality is a combination of premium materials and high production standards that everyone can feel good about.

Essential design. We don't chase trends, and we don't sell everything. We're expert curators that find the very best and bring it to you at the lowest prices.

Always a better deal. Through innovation and real price transparency we want to offer the best deal to both our customers and our factory partners.

Environmentally and Socially conscious. We're committed to sustainable materials and sustainable production methods. That means a cleaner environment and fair wages for factory workers.

Design and analyze A/B tests to optimize ad creatives, targeting, and bidding strategies across platforms.
Partner with product, finance, and data science teams to ensure alignment and leverage insights across the organization.

Are you passionate about improving our environment for this generation and those to follow? Are you ready to take on new challenges and collaborate with a future-focused team leading the way into new markets? Join Nexamp! 

This is where you can learn from industry leaders and become one yourself. It's fast-paced, mission-based work that challenges the status quo. Be on the team that's changing the world. 

What we’re looking for: 

We're looking for a Lead Data Analyst to craft insightful and compelling data stories, empower business owners across Nexamp to make more effective data-driven decisions, and help build our self-service data platform. As one of the nation’s largest and longest tenured solar and storage owner operators – and one of the few that is fully vertically integrated – our data is a differentiator in the market and a catalyst for future growth. You’ll be solving uniquely challenging data problems, alongside a strong team, and for a company in which the business model and mission are inseparably intertwined: our solar farms save customers money, help the planet, and are profitable for Nexamp and its investors. 

This role will be hybrid, based out of our Boston office, and you will report to the Director of Product, Data.

What you’ll do:  

Own and Deliver Data Products: Independently gather requirements for, prioritize, deliver, maintain, and continuously improve reusable data models, dashboards, analyses, A/B tests, and other data assets. Act as the product manager and implementer for your domain’s data offerings. Implement work using advanced SQL and BI tool skills. 
Be a Trusted Data Partner: Become the subject matter expert for data in your business areas. Identify opportunities for impact, proactively surface insights, support decision-making, and contribute to and influence business strategy and initiatives. Serve as your business stakeholders’ right hand. Support other business areas opportunistically.
Drive Data Quality, Documentation, and Engineering: Create and maintain comprehensive data documentation and communicate updates to your stakeholders. Write user stories or tickets for data engineering, validate data mapping, conduct QA, and implement data quality monitoring.
Foster Data Culture and Adoption: Monitor the usage of data assets, increase data literacy, and promote self-service through BI tools among stakeholders. Provide training, guidance, and support as needed.  
Collaborate Across the Data Team: Work within a centralized data team using agile methodologies. Collaborate with peer analysts through overlapping work, priority shifting, and code reviews to broaden your Nexamp knowledge.
Influence Data Strategy: Partner with the data architect, engineers, scientists, and analysts to shape the vision and roadmap for Nexamp’s data platform. Define and track annual OKRs to measure your impact.  

What you’ll bring: 

5-7 years of experience as a data analyst serving business owners and collaborating with data engineers (experience in the energy/construction industry is a plus, but not required) 
Advanced in SQL and BI tool administration and usage (experience with Databricks and Sigma are a plus, but not required) 
Strong track record of independently solving problems.
Commitment to Nexamp's mission and have a passion for solving tomorrow's climate crisis today.
Demonstrated experience in effectively communicating information, ideas, and perspectives with people inside and beyond your organization.   
Experience in showcasing initiative to make improvements to current work, processes, products, and services across the organization. We value accountability and an ownership mentality. 
Ability to ask appropriate questions, analyze data, identify the root causes of problems, and present creative solutions. 
Expertise in building strong internal and external relationships with customers and stakeholders, instilling trust and loyalty across the industry. 
Eagerness to develop a fundamental understanding of how Nexamp operates and then apply that knowledge effectively to inform business decisions.  

If you don’t meet 100% of the above qualifications, but see yourself contributing, please apply.

At Nexamp, our mission is to build the future of energy so it is clean, simple, and accessible for all. We are committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, veteran status, or any other basis protected by law. By encouraging a culture where ideas and decisions come from all people, we believe it will help us grow, innovate, and be a part of environmental and social change.

You’ll love working here because:  

Not only will you get to take part in meaningful work and have the chance to change the world alongside innovative, dedicated, and motivated peers, but you will also have access to all the benefits that Nexamp offers! This includes our competitive compensation package; a 401(k) employer-match; health, dental, and vision insurance starting day one; flexible paid time off and holiday PTO; commuter benefits, and cell phone reimbursement. We have headquarters in Boston, MA and Chicago, IL, in addition to growing offices nationwide. We provide healthy snacks, coffee, service days and other volunteer opportunities, company outings, and more!  

Nexamp's People team manages all aspects of recruitment and hiring within our organization. We want to inform third-party recruiters, staffing firms, and related agencies that Nexamp does not accept unsolicited resumes. Resumes will only be considered from these entities if a signed agreement is in place and the People team explicitly authorizes external recruiting assistance for a specific position. Any unsolicited resumes received will be deemed the property of Nexamp. We want to emphasize that Nexamp is not liable for any fees associated with unsolicited resumes.

Job Description

CyberArk is seeking a Senior Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst with a passion for sales strategy and business insight to join our Business Analytics team. In this role, you will act as a strategic partner to Sales and Sales Operations leaders around the globe—translating data into compelling narratives that drive better, faster decisions. You’ll play a key role in shaping how performance is measured, understood, and improved across our global go-to-market (GTM) organization. While you’ll contribute to dashboard development and scalable reporting in Tableau, this role goes far beyond building reports—you’ll be expected to uncover trends, connect dots across complex datasets, and communicate insights in a way that resonates with non-technical audiences. The ideal candidate is a business-minded analyst with strong sales acumen, excellent communication skills, and an instinct for asking the right questions to get to the heart of the problem.

Responsibilities:



Serve as an embedded analytics partner to global Sales and Sales Operations stakeholders, proactively identifying opportunities to improve pipeline, productivity, and conversion
Craft clear, executive-ready narratives based on deep-dive analyses of sales performance, pipeline coverage, segmentation, and revenue trends
Translate complex data and technical concepts into actionable recommendations that are easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand and act upon
Design and evolve self-service dashboards and tools in Tableau that reduce friction and enable faster time-to-decision
Maintain a high bar for data accuracy and consistency across reports and ad hoc deliverables
Collaborate cross-functionally with Sales, RevOps, Marketing, Finance, and IT to align on business definitions and ensure reliable analytics infrastructure
Help drive a data-driven culture by enabling stakeholders to interpret KPIs and use insights effectively



Qualifications



4–6 years of experience in Sales Analytics, Sales Operations, Business Intelligence, or a related field
Proven ability to extract and communicate insights from complex data—especially in a Sales or GTM environment
Strong business judgment, with experience working directly with senior stakeholders and cross-functional teams
Working knowledge of SQL and experience with Tableau or a similar BI platform (depth of tool expertise less important than the ability to learn quickly)
Understanding of B2B sales metrics, pipeline stages, and CRM data (Salesforce experience a plus)
Excellent storytelling skills—both written and verbal—with the ability to tailor messages to executive and frontline audiences
Self-starter who thrives in a fast-paced, dynamic environment and isn’t afraid to ask questions or challenge assumptions
Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative or business-related field
Smart, bold but humble attitude to work collaboratively with CyberArk colleagues



Additional Information

CyberArk is an Equal Opportunity Employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or protected Veteran status.

We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of employment Visa at this time.

The salary range for this position is $87,000 – $121,000/year, plus commissions or discretionary bonus, which will be based on the employee’s performance.

Lumafield was founded in 2019 to upgrade manufacturing.




We are engineers with deep experience across the product development cycle, from initial ideas to shipping hardware, across industries and specializations, who became frustrated by the cost and complexity of modern manufacturing. So we decided to upgrade it.




Engineers make million-dollar decisions every day, and they need tools that give them the greatest possible insight into their products. By offering unprecedented visibility into products, as well as AI-driven tools that highlight problems and generate quantitative data, Lumafield promises to revolutionize the way complex products are created, manufactured, and used across industries. We started with industrial CT scanning, which for us was the most valuable but underutilized tool in the manufacturing toolbox, enabling us to rapidly inspect essential components non-destructively.




We rebuilt the whole system, from X-ray capture, to computer vision analysis, to web-based collaboration, to the entire business model, making the most advanced manufacturing tech more accessible to every industry. Our company, like our platform, is designed for upgrades. We’re building for greater intelligence, autonomy, and speed. For deeper vision, operational excellence, and powerful insights. And then we'll upgrade it all again.




Lumafield is headquartered in Cambridge, MA, and has an office in San Francisco, CA.




About the role:




The ideal candidate for this role comes from a Data Science background with startup experience working with systems. If you thrive on solving big business problems, love connecting the dots between technology and strategy, and want to see your ideas come to life across the entire organization, this is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. This role will be focused on providing critical insights to the business, as well as building and maintaining the required business systems, workflows, processes, and connections necessary to get those analyses up and running. As such, the role will require being comfortable handling a “full stack” of tasks at a high level, ranging from systems implementation, translating process requirements into systems requirements and vice versa, data engineering, and data analysis.




This role puts you at the heart of our company’s evolution, giving you the opportunity to shape how we work, make data-driven decisions, and deliver exceptional value to our customers and teams.




What you'll do:
Partner with leaders and teams across the business to uncover high-impact opportunities, translating real business needs into innovative system and data solutions that drive company growth and operational excellence
Improve or build new capabilities in existing business systems and hand off to system owners throughout the company
Champion process optimization by identifying and implementing both technology-driven and strategic improvements, ensuring our business stays agile and competitive
Maintain a stack of business systems and build integrations and connections between them as needed
Define and document these processes and workflows in process diagrams, wireframes, mapping documents, functional specifications, non-functional specifications, ERDs, use cases, user stories, and logical data models
Serve as a trusted advisor and trainer, equipping end users and stakeholders with the knowledge and tools they need to maximize the impact of our systems and insights
Project manage external systems consultants, where necessary




About you:
5-10 years of work experience in data analysis, business intelligence, and business systems
Strong SQL and proficient Python knowledge
Experience with data warehouse technical architectures, infrastructure components, ETL/ ELT and reporting/analytic tools
Experience in API integrations and data migration/data conversion.
Experience with data visualization tools and packages (e.g. Looker, Tableau, Power BI)
Experience implementing business systems, sometimes from scratch (including understanding business processes, gathering user requirements, design, testing, deployment, and training)
Must have the ability to communicate, motivate and organize projects throughout the company
Must have ability to work independently and handle end-to-end projects







Lumafield offers both competitive cash and equity compensation, as well as a health & wellness stipend, 401k, parental leave, flexible PTO, commuter benefits, company wide events and more! 




Lumafield is committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, because the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be. Do you feel like your skills don’t meet every single requirement listed? We encourage you to apply anyway – If you’re excited about our technology, the opportunity, and are eager to learn more we’d love to hear from you!  




In keeping with our beliefs and goals, no employee or applicant will face discrimination or harassment based on: race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, genetic information or veteran status.
