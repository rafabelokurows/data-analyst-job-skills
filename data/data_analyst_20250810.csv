However, steep entry barriers, including high minimum investments (~€10m), hefty paperwork and the challenge of selecting the right fund have traditionally kept individual investors at bay, with access largely limited to big institutions or a select few.

Enter Moonfare.

We've made investing in private equity more accessible and straightforward with our fully digital investment platform. Now, qualified investors can access some of the most sought-after private market funds at lower minimum investment amounts*.

The diverse Moonfare team – which includes alumni from top private banks, groundbreaking startups and beyond – is united in pushing boundaries and redefining the private equity landscape.

You will shape how we understand performance, measure success, and identify new opportunities across the company. Your work will help ensure that decisions at Moonfare are always backed by clear, well structured, and meaningful data.

Placing Moonfare second signifies that our individual professional future at Moonfare depends on the company's commercial success. Prioritising ourselves third reflects our humility in putting clients and Moonfare before personal interests.

We foster personal growth but each of us earns our place as a Moonfarian through merit - Growth and Merit. We hire, retain, and develop exceptional people and invest in empowering them to excel. We must all earn our place at the table every day.


We understand the important role that diversity plays in our success. Different backgrounds, experiences and ideas push us further and raise the bar.

About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

💼 £45,000–£55,000 + benefits | Hybrid – London




We’re working with a pioneering nuclear energy company that’s transforming how low-carbon power is designed, delivered, and scaled across the UK. As they continue to grow, they’re looking for a skilled and curious Data Analyst to help drive smarter decisions across engineering, operations, and strategy.




This isn’t your typical analyst role — it’s a chance to work at the intersection of energy, innovation, and impact. You’ll be turning complex datasets into meaningful insights that shape everything from reactor performance to long-term infrastructure planning.




Why This Role Stands Out

✔ Work on nationally significant clean energy projects

✔ Join a purpose-driven business at the cutting edge of nuclear technology

✔ Strong technical team with a collaborative, learning-focused culture

✔ Hybrid working with flexible hours and career development support




What You’ll Be Doing

Analysing operational and performance data from nuclear systems and infrastructure
Building dashboards, reports, and predictive models to inform business and engineering decisions
Working closely with engineers, scientists, and leadership teams to translate data into action
Supporting continuous improvement and regulatory reporting processes
Contributing to data strategy, governance, and tooling decisions as the team scales




What They’re Looking For

Strong experience in data analysis, ideally within engineering, energy, or regulated sectors
Proficient in SQL, Python (or R), and data visualisation tools like Power BI or Tableau
Comfortable working with complex datasets and extracting clear insights
Great communication skills — able to explain technical findings to non-technical stakeholders
Passionate about using data to contribute to a cleaner energy future




If you’re looking for a meaningful role where your analysis directly supports the UK’s path to net zero — this is it.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.

To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.


What we look for
Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.


What we offer
Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.


Commitment & contract
Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time or part-time.

Location
Milan (Italy), London (UK).

The selection process
If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests designed to assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. They’re challenging and may take several hours to complete. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.

We set the bar high and won't extend an offer until we're convinced we've found the right candidate. This is why a job may stay open for months or be reposted several times.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and provide reasonable accommodations for an individual with disabilities—just let us know through this form.

Before you apply
If you’ve applied before but didn't receive an offer, we recommend waiting at least one year before applying again.

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment. We’re extremely ambitious and we hold ourselves—and one another—to a high standard. While this tends to lead to extraordinary learning, achievement, and career growth, it also requires significant commitment.

To help you ramp up quickly and set yourself up for success, we recommend spending your first few months working from our Milan office, regardless of your long-term work location. It’s the best way to rapidly absorb our company culture and build trust with your new teammates. We’ll support you with generous travel and accommodation assistance. After that, you’re welcome to work from our offices in Milan or London, or remotely from approved countries—depending on what we agree at the offer stage.

If the role speaks to you and you’re excited to give your best, we’d love to hear from you. Apply now—we can’t wait to meet you.

London | Hybrid

£50–60k + benefits




Join a well-backed, growing bank in the middle of a major transformation - modernising its systems, launching new business lines, and putting data at the centre of it all.




This is a chance for a hands-on Data Analyst to make a real impact. You'll work closely with business teams, shape how data is used across the bank, and help build the foundations of a more data-driven culture.




If you're looking to grow your career while doing meaningful work - not just pulling reports - this could be a great fit.




What You’ll Be Doing

Work with stakeholders across the business (Risk, Compliance, Change) to understand and solve real-world data problems
Clean, validate, and reconcile data from multiple systems, including core banking and CRM
Support data migration efforts as the bank upgrades and modernises its platforms
Contribute to shaping data governance and improving data quality across the organisation
Ensure reporting data meets internal governance and compliance standards
Be part of the wider transformation journey, helping the bank scale its data maturity




Essential Skills

Strong SQL skills
Experience working with multiple relational databases (e.g. SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres)
Awareness of data modelling concepts
Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail
Ability to work with non-technical stakeholders and explain complex data clearly
Proactive, organised, and comfortable working in a fast-changing environment




Desirable Skills

Familiarity with BI tools like Power BI or Tableau
Basic Python or scripting for data manipulation
Understanding of ETL pipelines or data flows
Experience with core banking or financial systems
Exposure to cloud-based platforms (e.g. Azure)
Awareness of regulatory frameworks like GDPR or BCBS239




Why This Role Stands Out

Backed by a major European bank – stability + long-term growth
Transformation in motion – new leadership, new systems, and a clear modernisation plan
Big impact, small team – get visibility, influence change, and work closely with senior decision-makers
Supportive environment – strong team culture, mentoring, and variety in the work
Hybrid working – 3 days in the office based in a brand-new central London office




If you’re a data analyst who enjoys making sense of complex data and wants to play a part in shaping the future of a growing bank - we’d love to hear from you. Apply today!

The Independent is an online news publisher that was established in 1986 as a national newspaper independent of party political affiliations or proprietorial influence. In 2016, The Independent became a fully digital publisher, moving away from print in pursuit of sustainability, and to safeguard its values and journalism for the future.




The Independent has always thrived through innovation and change. It was the first British newspaper to add a Saturday magazine; the first to give photography the same prestige as a news copy; the first to challenge the Westminster lobby system of closed briefings; the first broadsheet to move to the more compact ‘tabloid’ format; the first to launch a concise quality compact paper; and the first – and only – major newspaper to pull off a successful transformation to fully digital publishing.




Through The Independent, Independent TV, eCommerce, indy100, subscriptions and other ‘reader revenues’, The Independent plans to continue the work of many decades, bringing much-needed independent journalism to over 100 million unique global visitors a month, make its voice ever louder and more insistent the world over.




In 2024 The Independent’s portfolio of brands increased through a new licensing partnership with BuzzFeed Inc. to operate the BuzzFeed brands in the UK - BuzzFeed UK, Tasty, Seasoned and HuffPost UK. The additional brands echo the existing business ethos and allow for increased audiences and a further strategic diversification of revenue streams.

We’re on the lookout for a sharp, proactive Data Analyst to take ownership of our Business Intelligence function, primarily within Tableau, and serve as the key bridge between our data engineering team and business stakeholders across Go-to-Market, Finance, and Product.

This isn’t your typical “churn out dashboards” kind of role. We want someone who not only delivers insights but also helps empower others across the business to access and interpret data themselves - driving a shift from centralised requests to more self-serve capabilities.

You’ll sit within our Operations team, collaborating closely with our Data Engineering and Revenue Operations teams, and play a critical role in unlocking better, faster decisions through clean, accessible data.

Responsibilities


Own and evolve our Tableau environment: from data modelling through to dashboard creation, governance, and best practices.
Be the go-to person for BI—serving as the bridge between technical data engineering and non-technical business users.
Work with stakeholders across GTM (marketing, sales and customer success), Product and Finance to translate business questions into analytical solutions.
Identify common reporting pain points and proactively design scalable solutions.
Champion and grow our power user network—You’ll help us grow a culture of data self-sufficiency, enabling our teams to tweak and build their own dashboards with confidence—reducing dependency and unlocking agility.
Maintain documentation, training materials, and guides to support data literacy and self-sufficiency.
Ensure data accuracy and consistency across all dashboards and reports.
Collaborate with the data engineering team to improve data pipelines and optimise source data for analysis.


Requirements


Proven experience in a BI-focused data role, ideally within a tech or SaaS environment. Ability to understand and communicate SaaS financial terminology
Strong hands-on skills with Tableau (or a comparable enterprise BI tool), including dashboard creation, performance tuning, and data modelling.
Proficient in SQL, Python and TypeScript, with solid knowledge of key data libraries. You should understand how source systems feed into BI tools and how to manage that flow effectively.
A sharp analytical mind with strong commercial awareness—this role is all about uncovering insights that drive business decisions.
A clear and confident communicator who can translate complex data concepts into simple, actionable language for non-technical audiences.
Experience in reviewing tech stack - recommending and rolling out improvements
Passionate about empowering others with data—you’re not just delivering reports, you’re enabling smarter decisions across the business.
Experience working with cloud data warehouses (e.g. Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake) is a definite plus.
A meticulous eye for detail and a high bar for data accuracy.


Bonus Skills


Experience delivering Tableau training or building enablement materials.
Familiarity with dbt, Power BI, Looker Studio, or other modern data stack components.
A background in operational analytics or GTM performance reporting.

ÚNETE A LA TRANSFORMACIÓN HACIA UNA AI-DRIVEN COMPANY En Gomez y Crespo, no estamos simplemente digitalizando procesos: estamos evolucionando hacia una empresa guiada por la inteligencia artificial.

Este cambio ya ha comenzado, y buscamos mentes jóvenes y con impulso que quieran formar parte del motor que lo impulsa desde dentro.

¿Nuestro reto?

Automatizar procesos, optimizar operaciones y liberar el talento humano de tareas repetitivas para enfocarse en lo que realmente importa.

Si te interesa automatizar lo que no suma, optimizar lo que limita y potenciar la inteligencia colectiva con IA, esta es tu oportunidad para aprender, construir y marcar la diferencia.

No vendrás a ocupar un puesto.

Vendrás a ser parte del cambio.

¿Qué harás?

Detectar oportunidades de automatización en procesos reales de negocio (administración, compras, operaciones, etc.)

con herramientas como Power Automate, Zapier, n8n, etc.

Mapear, optimizar y estructurar flujos operativos mediante BPM (Bizagi, BonitaSoft...) antes de automatizarlos.

Actuar como conector entre departamentos, entendiendo necesidades y transformándolas en soluciones con impacto.

Participar activamente en pilotos del Comité de IA y experimentar con tecnologías emergentes como chatbots, OCR o flujos basados en IA generativa.

Apoyar en el diseño de dashboards, automatizaciones y pequeños scripts de integración.

Ayudar a documentar buenas prácticas, mantener actualizado el repositorio de flujos y colaborar en la mejora continua del sistema.

¿Qué buscamos en ti?

Formación técnica: Grado en Ingeniería Informática, Telecomunicaciones, Física, Matemáticas... o bien Ciclo Formativo de Grado Superior en Desarrollo de Aplicaciones, Inteligencia Artificial o Programación.

Inquietud por la automatización, la inteligencia artificial y la mejora de procesos.

Conocimiento básico en herramientas de automatización (Power Automate, Zapier, Make, n8n...) y nociones de IA generativa (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.).

Capacidad de análisis lógico y mentalidad orientada a la mejora continua.

Buena comunicación, visión práctica y actitud colaborativa.

¿Qué te ofrecemos?

Incorporación en formato presencial en Ourense, con posibilidad de modelo híbrido en momentos determinados.

Salario competitivo, ajustado a la experiencia y valía del candidato/a.

Proyecto transversal con impacto real, trabajando mano a mano con el Director General.

Visibilidad estratégica desde el primer día y oportunidad de dejar huella en cómo trabajará la empresa en los próximos años.

Formación, mentoring y participación en decisiones tecnológicas.

Ambiente humano, horizontal, cercano y sin capas intermedias innecesarias.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together.

You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$121,100 - C$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location.

This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements



Travel:-

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources

Partner closely with Communications, Policy, Marketing and Product teams to identify and analyze key trends and produce thought leadership pieces and campaign content leveraging Stripe data
Collaborate with external vendors, academics, and think tanks to advance Stripe’s research agenda and advocacy positions



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field

Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We believe that each Viking is unique and brings exponential value to the company. In return, we provide Vikings with the opportunity to solve problems through continuous learning and fostering feedback, ultimately mastering their craft.

We are embarking on an adventure and rely on our team of skilled, enthusiastic, and collaborative Vikings to turn our ship towards a new horizon.

About the Role:

Big Viking Games is looking for a Staff Product Data Analyst to join our team and own analytics for our flagship titles—YoWorld and FishWorld. Embedded within our cross-functional product pods, you'll partner with Product, Marketing, FP&A and Data to: evaluate player behaviour, refine monetization strategies, and architect predictive models, revenue forecasts, and agentic workflows that automate key live-ops processes.

Reporting into the Product org, this Staff-level role is ideal for someone who thrives in a fast-paced, hypothesis-driven environment and wants their dashboards, forecasts and automation to directly impact millions of players.

You'll help drive smarter decisions across roadmap planning, feature development, campaign performance, and in-game economy optimization—while championing first-principles analytics, machine-learning pipelines, and self-serve data automation.

What You'll Do:


End-to-end analytics & modelling
Build and maintain dashboards (DAU, player spend, content performance, pricing effectiveness) for stakeholders across Product, Marketing and Finance
Analyze player behaviour, campaign performance and monetization trends to inform roadmap and live-ops tuning
Develop predictive models and forecasting pipelines (e.g. adoption curves, revenue projections, churn risk) using first-principles thinking.
Impact & experimentation
Lead A/B test design, impact analysis and lift measurement for Gem Events, Challenges, Reactivation Offers and new gameplay features (ex. SplashO, Storylines)
Partner with FP&A to quantify cost savings and migration impacts
Automation & scalability
Identify inefficiencies in IAP config, asset throughput and content velocity—recommend and build agentic workflows to streamline campaign planning and delivery
Collaborate with Data Engineering to operationalize data pipelines, enable self-serve analytics and embed predictive insights into product dashboards.
Cross-functional thought partnership
Translate complex quantitative findings into clear, actionable recommendations for PMs, engineers and live-ops leads
Evangelize next-gen analytics best practices, mentor junior analysts and shape our data-driven culture


Requirements

The Must-Haves:


6+ years in product, business or game analytics—ideally in mobile or live-ops gaming
Expert SQL skills; ability to wrangle messy data into clean, performant datasets
Proficiency in Python or R and experience with ML libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)
Hands-on experience building and maintaining BI dashboards (Looker, Tableau, Power BI or similar)
Ability to blend descriptive analytics (""What happened? Why?"") with predictive insight (""What will happen? How can we optimize?"")
Proven track record applying first-principles thinking to build and validate forecasting and predictive models that drove measurable product or revenue impact (validating assumptions, testing holdout samples, iterating on feature engineering)
Ability to translate complex data insights into concise stories and actionable recommendations


The Nice-To-Haves:


Experience with in-game economy design or IAP configuration.
Familiarity with A/B testing frameworks (Optimizely, Firebase, custom tooling).
Background in automated data pipelines and agentic workflow tools.
Master's degree in a quantitative field (Statistics, Economics, Computer Science) or equivalent experience.

We’re on a mission to connect more readers with the right book at the right time - and that mission is powered by data. Our Forecasting & Demand Analyst is a strategic role, directly shaping how we print, reprint, and manage stock across thousands of titles in a dynamic and fast-growing catalog.

This is not a reporting or operations support role. It’s a high-impact, builder position for an experienced analyst who can architect forecasting logic from scratch, scale systems across thousands of SKUs, and drive inventory decisions that balance customer demand, print economics, and working capital. If you’ve owned demand planning systems, built forecasting models that guided purchasing or production, and want to bring your skills to a mission-driven, innovative company - this is your opportunity to lead from day one.

This position can be fully remote in the following states ONLY: Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. We also offer hybrid flexibility from our Naperville, IL or New York City offices if preferred. This job does not require travel except for possible all company meetings.

This is an exempt, salaried position with an annual salary between $90,000 - $110,000.  We determine starting pay based on a thorough evaluation of job-related factors, including geographic location, market conditions, relevant experience, training, and education. This process ensures a fair and competitive salary that aligns with both the company and the candidate’s qualifications.  

What You’ll Own


Build and evolve forecasting models to predict demand across frontlist and backlist titles, integrating historical sales, POS trends, seasonality, pre-orders, and market signals
Design and automate demand planning tools in Excel, SQL, SAP, and Power BI to improve forecast accuracy, speed, and visibility
Prototype and refine forecasting logic (e.g., moving averages, regressions, time series, smoothing, and basic ML models) to guide print runs, reprints, and safety stock levels
Own forecast accuracy tracking, inventory health reporting, and stock risk detection
Identify and eliminate manual pain points in current forecasting workflows and replace with scalable solutions
Collaborate with Sales, Marketing, and Manufacturing to adjust models and plans based on campaign activity and shifts in market behavior
Partner with Operations and IT to improve integration of forecasting logic with our ERP (SAP Business One → S4 Hana)
Explore use of AI/LLMs for forecasting automation and cross-system data integration


What You Bring


5+ years of experience owning inventory or demand forecasting systems (not just reporting) in supply chain, retail, publishing, or a relevant vertical
Proven ability to build forecasting logic from scratch, with strong understanding of statistical modeling and time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, exponential smoothing, regression models)
Proficiency in Excel (advanced formulas + automation), SQL, and at least one BI tool (e.g., Power BI)
Experience forecasting at scale across hundreds or thousands of SKUs, ideally with long tail or seasonal demand patterns
Strong business judgment - you know when to trust the model, when to override it, and how to communicate risk to stakeholders
Exposure to Python or R for data analysis or light ML experimentation (preferred)
Familiarity with SAP Business One or S/4 Hana, or forecasting/reporting in an ERP-integrated environment
Meticulous attention to data integrity, an ownership mindset, and an eagerness to build new solutions
Bonus: A love of books and curiosity about how publishing works


Why Sourcebooks?

At Sourcebooks, innovation and mission go hand in hand.

Ready to Apply?

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements

The Position

Uplight is creating a new category of energy. We make software that manages energy resources in homes and businesses—including things like smart thermostats, electric vehicles, solar panels, storage batteries, heat pumps, and even people’s behavior—to generate, shift, or save energy to balance the grid, making it more efficient and reliable. This creates clean energy capacity that can be used by the power grid instead of burning more fossil fuels. Our solutions accelerate the transition to clean energy and save money for energy customers.

We are seeking a Data Engineer focusing on data platform enablement to support our mission and scale our impact

How You Will Make An Impact

As a Data Engineer at Uplight, you’ll play a central role in designing and maintaining the infrastructure that ingests, transforms, and delivers data across our platform. Your work ensures that data systems are reliable, scalable, observable, and cost-efficient—forming the backbone of many customer-facing and data science-driven solutions.

You’ll partner with cross-functional teams including analysts, product managers, and data scientists to ensure the platform meets the evolving needs of our business and our users.

What You Get To Do


Design, build, and maintain data pipelines using Databricks (Spark, Delta Lake) and Python.
Collaborate across teams to develop core platform capabilities—such as orchestration, metadata management, and data quality—delivering scalable, reusable solutions
Improve reliability and fault tolerance of ingest pipelines handling large volumes of utility data.
Build and support MLOps tooling, including data pipelines, model registries, and serving infrastructure
Participate in the full software development lifecycle: design, build, test, deploy, and support
Contribute to a remote-first team that values agility, collaboration, and clarity—favoring whiteboarding, async design docs, and reflective retros over rigid ceremonies.
Continuously learn and grow with support from senior engineers and team leads
Help maintain a team culture rooted in curiosity, empathy, and continuous improvement


What You Bring To Uplight


2–5 years of software engineering experience, ideally in backend or data-focused roles
Experience with Databricks, Spark, or similar big data technologies
Proficiency in Python and SQL
Exposure to cloud platforms such as GCP or AWS
Familiarity with CI/CD tools and infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Docker, Terraform, CircleCI)
Strong communication and collaboration skills; a team player excited to learn and grow


Bonus Points


Familiarity with MLOps concepts and tools (e.g., MLflow, model versioning)
Experience with real-time or streaming data systems (e.g., Kafka, Structured Streaming)
Understanding of data observability, lineage, and quality
Prior work in the energy or utility space
Strong grasp of Big Data challenges including cost vs performance tradeoffs


Don’t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women, marginalized genders and people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification. At Uplight we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

Developing subject matter expertise in specific retail domains, ensuring that the technology product maintains exceptional quality when delivered to production
Working alongside internal and external development teams and technology SaaS vendors to implement new technology products, clarifying any questions relating to business requirements or process along the way
Working with Agile teams contributing to successful sprint objectives
Clarifying questions and providing documentation to support completion of development and test phases
Creating understandable visual representations to communicate complex concepts and models for various target audiences

Who we are:

Our goal is to transform the planet into one that is fuelled by modern, reliable and clean energy.  For over a decade we’ve helped utilities & energy providers optimize and modernize their grid through our cloud-based grid analytics solutions.




The problem we’re solving:

The electrical grid was designed for a one-way flow of energy, with generation at the top and consumption at the edges. To enable clean energy on the scale required to address climate change (decarbonization), the grid of tomorrow needs to allow for distributed energy sources (DERs), in the form of clean generation (e.g. solar), storage (e.g. batteries) and electric vehicles, that can reside anywhere in the grid (decentralization). To achieve that, digitalization is key. Many disparate data sources must be brought together and their validity ensured so that smart-grid applications can be built on top.  At Awesense, we have built some of these applications ourselves. Our current goal is providing a digital layer via an API-based energy data platform so that other solution providers, partners, and even energy companies can easily build such applications on top of it – and performance at scale is paramount. We want you to help with this as part of our services team.




Main responsibilities:
Client Engagement:
Talk with clients to understand what data they collect—including geospatial, graph/network, and time series data—in which systems, and how it can be extracted.
Identify data relationships and constraints, and business rules that must be enforced.
Determine the best way to map the client’s data to the Awesense data model, cross-referencing the different data types.
Data Integration Development:
Write code to retrieve data from source or intermediate systems.
Validate data against defined constraints.
Transform and cross-link data according to the mapping and prepare for ingestion.
Call Awesense REST APIs to push data into the platform.
Use Awesense REST & SQL APIs to retrieve, cross-reference, or validate previously ingested data.
Pipeline Management:
Develop code for both one-time ingestion and, importantly, ongoing data ingestion pipelines.
Ensure code is robust to errors and provides comprehensive logging and reporting.
Monitor, troubleshoot, and improve data pipelines.
Collaboration:
Work with teammates for code review and quality assurance.




What you’ll assist with:
Work with the client manager to report issues back to clients and iterate on solutions as needed.
Help improve data integration processes and tools.
When not working on client projects, assist either with platform development or implementing use cases on top of the platform APIs

﻿

What you’ll learn:
Problems and emerging solutions around grid decarbonization and the future-of-energy analytics sector.
