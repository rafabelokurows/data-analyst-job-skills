Our mission is to enable researchers to find cures faster, empower every clinician to be an expert, and help families make the most informed decisions about their care. Achieving Truveta’ s ambitious vision requires an incredible team of talented and inspired people with a special combination of health, software and big data experience who share our company values.

Truveta was born in the Pacific Northwest, but we have employees who live across the country. Our team enjoys the flexibility of a hybrid model and working from anywhere. In person attendance is required for one week during the year for Truveta Planning Week.

For overall team productivity, we optimize meeting hours in the pacific time zone. We avoid scheduling recurring meetings that start after 3pm PT, however, ad hoc meetings occur between 8am-6pm Pacific time.

Who We Need

Truveta is rapidly building a talented and diverse team to tackle complex health and technical challenges. Beyond core capabilities, we are seeking problem solvers, passionate and collaborative teammates, and those willing to roll up their sleeves while making a difference. If you are interested in the opportunity to pursue purposeful work, join a mission-driven team, and build a rewarding career while having fun, Truveta may be the perfect fit for you.

This Opportunity

The Analytics Response Team (ART) sits within Truveta’s broader Partner Analytics team and plays a critical role in coordinating with internal teams and supporting customers to get fast, high-quality answers from Truveta data. As a Partner Data Analyst on the ART team, you will help ensure customers find value in the data, support issue investigation, and build confidence in the platform through efficient, responsive analytics. You will support data quality efforts, conduct analyses, answer customer questions, and support new data releases. You will be solving consequential problems in healthcare using an EHR database of ~100 million patients (and growing!) and make an impact on patient care. As a Partner Data Analyst, you will work at the intersection of EHR data knowledge and efficient data delivery. You’ll support feasibility analyses, quickly summarize patient populations, and assist in identifying and tracking data issues. This position is ideal for someone with hands-on experience working with EHR or healthcare data, strong data wrangling skills, and a passion for translating data into actionable insights.

Responsibilities


Wrangle large healthcare datasets and translating clinical concepts into structured queries.
Summarize populations and generate feasibility numbers from clinical data quickly and accurately.
Use technical skills to scope out customer analyses requests, produce studies and results using SQL, R and Python within an agreed upon deadline.
Collaborate with life science, academic research organizations, and health system partners to conduct analyses.
Collaborate with success managers and support team to ensure that Truveta partners can be successful with the platform.

Our culture is built on spontaneous moments—those hallway conversations, whiteboard brainstorms, and shared celebrations in each of our global offices—that simply can’t be replicated remotely. This role is expected to be in the office 5 days a week.

The User Operations team is central to ensuring that our customers' experience with our products is nothing short of exceptional. We resolve complex issues, provide technical guidance, and support customers in maximizing value and adoption from deploying our products. We work closely with Sales, Technical Success, Product, Engineering and others to deliver the best possible experience to our customers at scale. OpenAI's customers represent a range of diverse backgrounds and maturity, from early-stage startups to established global enterprises. Given OpenAI’s breakneck shipping cadence and growth—and the expectation that it will only accelerate—transforming our rich support data into real‑time insights and scalable, self‑serve analytics is critical to sustaining exceptional customer experiences on the path to AGI.

About The Role

We’re seeking a User Operations Data Analyst who will dig deep into user‑support data—surfacing trends, volumes, and friction signals—and turn these findings into actionable insights and always‑on reporting. You’ll design, build, and maintain self‑serve dashboards that keep every stakeholder informed in real time, partnering closely with Data Science and Engineering to ensure clean pipelines, robust models, and scalable tooling. Think proactive friction detection and real‑time service‑health views that help us stay ahead of demand—delivering decision‑grade insights, not just prettier slide decks.

This role is based in San Francisco, California. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In This Role, You Will


Explore large support and product datasets to uncover trends, volume drivers, and user‑experience pain points, distilling findings into clear, actionable narratives.
Build, enhance, and maintain self‑serve dashboards and reporting tools, enabling non‑technical teams to answer their own data questions.
Establish a unified metrics taxonomy for service‑health and performance—and build automated data‑sharing pipelines and scorecards with our BPO partners to ensure everyone operates from the same real‑time view of success
Leverage LLMs to build bespoke classifiers that automatically label and segment inbound volumes—powering smarter routing, richer self‑serve insights, and swifter root‑cause analysis.
Partner with Data Engineering to ensure reliable pipelines, implement data‑quality checks, and document sources of truth.
Jump into high‑priority special projects to conduct bespoke deep‑dive analyses and deliver clear, strategic recommendations to leadership.
Prototype quickly—leveraging ChatGPT, Jupyter notebooks, Retool, and other tools—to prove value before hardening with Engineering.
Collaborate with Data Science on predictive models and experimentation, translating results into operational recommendations.


You Might Thrive In This Role If You


8 + years in analytics, business intelligence, or data science, ideally supporting customer support or operations teams.
Expert‑level SQL skills and proficiency in Python or R for advanced analysis and automation
Hands‑on experience designing and maintaining BI dashboards (e.g. Looker, Mode, Tableau, Sundial) with a focus on clarity and self‑serve usability.
Hands‑on experience fine‑tuning or prompt‑engineering LLMs to build text classifiers, sentiment analysis, or tagging systems.
Demonstrated ability to translate complex datasets into clear business stories and recommendations for both technical and non‑technical audiences.
Familiarity with support metrics (SLAs, FCR, deflection) and ability to define service health KPIs.
Strong cross‑functional communication skills—comfortable collaborating daily with engineers, data scientists, and operations leaders.
An eye for detail, a zero‑defect mindset, and a bias toward action over theoretical perfection
Possess a strong bias for automation and can defend governance decisions that keep data and processes healthy as they grow.
Thrive in a fast‑moving, ambiguous environment where priorities can shift quickly.

Based at our San Francisco HQ, we operate fully in-person, move fast and hire people who are ready to win.

🚀 Your Mission

We are seeking a customer-focused Data Analyst to help our clients answer their most important business questions around GTM revenue performance and marketing spend optimization. This is not a heavy data-engineering role; instead, you’ll use HockeyStack’s platform and available data to guide customers toward impactful insights and recommendations.

🔧 What You’ll Do


Partner with customers to solve their revenue goals, challenges, and questions. Use HockeyStack’s platform to uncover insights and deliver clear, actionable recommendations.
Translate complex metrics into straightforward explanations for non-technical audiences.
Be the Data Partner to support Customer Success Managers in delivering strategic guidance to clients.
Identify patterns and trends in marketing and sales data to advise customers on where to focus efforts.
Collaborate with internal teams to continuously enhance the customer experience.


🧩 Core Strengths


Business Insight: Ability to connect data to revenue outcomes and business strategy.
Customer Orientation: Skilled at understanding client goals and delivering value through insights.
Analytical Thinking: Comfortable framing and answering complex questions with data-driven logic.
Clear Communication: Able to translate analytics into simple, impactful recommendations.


🧬 What We’re Looking For


Ownership-first mindset — you take initiative, move fast, and figure things out
Thrive in early-stage, high-urgency environments where speed and impact matter
Curious, self-aware, and feedback-driven — you bring energy, not ego
See this role as a defining chapter — not a stepping stone or side quest
Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Data Science, Applied Economics, or a related field.
1–3 years of experience in Data Analytics or Consulting with Analytical focus. Strong preference for candidates with Marketing Analytics or GTM/Sales Analytics Experience.
Strong problem-solving skills with the ability to structure and answer key business questions.
Excellent communication skills to convey data-driven insights to senior stakeholders.
Familiarity with SaaS, B2B marketing, or revenue analytics is a strong plus.
Ability to think strategically and recommend actions based on data, without needing to deep-dive into raw datasets.


✨ Why Join Now?

We’re at an inflection point. The product is proven, the market is massive, and the opportunity is wide open. You’ll be joining a company with real traction, rapid growth, and meaningful backing—where every person still shapes the outcome. This isn’t just a job. It’s a chance to build something category-defining with people who care deeply about doing it right.

We’re building a high-performing, in-person culture at our San Francisco HQ, where the team collaborates shoulder-to-shoulder five days a week. While that's our standard for most roles, this position is uniquely flexible—offering remote options for exceptional candidates based in the U.S. or internationally, as long as you're fully available during U.S. business hours.

More than 70% of what we consume in the U.S. is moved by trucks. Those trucks are powered by over 3.5 million drivers per year and create over $700B in annual revenue. Trucking is a massive industry but it is a traditional industry and like many traditional industries, it is ripe for innovation.

CloudTrucks is building the operating system for trucking and is the first platform specifically designed to empower truck drivers. Our all-in-one, “business in a box” solution optimizes and automates operations and accelerates cash-flow for drivers, so they can focus on building their business.

Marketing Our Marketing team is focused on driver acquisition. As a data analyst, you’ll have the opportunity to work closely with them to continue building and improving our Marketing Attribution models, and provide insights into the Marketing funnel and campaign performance.
RevOps Our RevOps team works closely with Sales to onboard drivers to CloudTrucks. As a data analyst, you’ll have the opportunity to help the team track and measure each step of the sales funnel and look for opportunities where processes can be improved. You’ll be able to combine sales and product data to do in-depth analysis and provide insights into funnel performance, define, build and monitor revenue impact metrics.


Responsibilities


Own end-to-end reporting from building the data pipeline to data visualization.
Build data pipelines to support both internal and customer facing products, and collaborate with Product development teams to launch and measure success.
Work cross-functionally to build KPIs, and develop complex transformative analyses that help teams improve their processes, make product and business decisions.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $167,300 - $251,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

As a member of our People Strategy and Operations team, you will have an integral role in driving the insights, operations, and strategy. This role blends technical expertise, business acumen, and a passion for storytelling through data.
You will build the foundation for people analytics, including data pipelines, dashboards, and reporting standards across systems like Workday, Looker, Greenhouse, and Lattice.
You will partner closely with People Partners and business leaders to identify key metrics and deliver actionable insights across the employee lifecycle (e.g., hiring, attrition, engagement, promotions)
You will drive cross-functional analytics projects that support strategic decisions on org design, retention, performance, and compensation.
You will maintain a strong data governance framework to ensure accuracy, privacy, and consistency across systems and reporting.


Requirements


Since we’re still in scrappy startup mode, you’ll need to be a high-impact self-starter. You take initiative to move projects forward and can operate well with little guidance.
Raw Smarts: You’ve fine-tuned your first principle and conceptual problem-solving skills. You can look at complex problems and solve them from start to finish.
Strong analytical skills: you nerd out about data, can quickly structure analyses to answer key business questions to drive decision-making, and will also have perspectives on building the right data architecture. Advanced Excel and Google Sheets skills, with experience building and managing complex data models and calculations.
Technical capabilities: Proven experience designing data warehouses and dashboards (e.g., Looker, Workday, BigQuery), working with SQL, and integrating data across People systems. Experience with Looker preferred.
Flexibility and hustle: You manage change and ambiguity well, and have no problems juggling multiple priorities while executing in a fast-paced environment. You’re comfortable pivoting quickly and often.
5+ years of experience in people analytics, workforce strategy, or business analytics, ideally in a high-growth or tech environment.

Mindful movement. It’s at the core of why we do what we do at ALO—it’s our calling. Because mindful movement in the studio leads to better living.

That’s the real meaning of studio-to-street: taking the consciousness from practice on the mat and putting it into practice in life.

OVERVIEW

You’ll independently engage with cross-functional business stakeholders, influence high-impact decisions, and help build a scalable analytics function. You’ll also manage junior team members and contribute to AI-driven initiatives, empowering the business with smarter, faster insights. If you're a proactive, influential communicator who thrives at the intersection of business, data, and AI innovation, this is the role for you.

Collaborate with AI and data science teams to integrate AI tools (e.g., LLMs, recommendation engines) into business workflows and decision support systems.
Leverage generative AI tools to accelerate insight generation, automate repetitive analysis, and enhance stakeholder communication.
Mentor junior analysts and foster a high-performance culture through best practices and coaching.
Support as the analytical right hand to the Senior Director of Analytics, helping prioritize and drive high-value data initiatives across the company.


QUALIFICATIONS


7–8 years of professional experience in data analytics, with a track record of using insights to shape business strategy in high-growth e-commerce or digitally enabled retail environments.
Minimum of 2 years of professional experience managing and developing junior team members.
Strong e-commerce domain expertise, including digital funnel optimization, omnichannel performance, customer segmentation, and merchandising analytics.
Strong business acumen and executive presence, with the ability to influence senior stakeholders through data storytelling.
Advanced SQL and proficiency in Python or R; strong grasp of experimentation design, statistics, and data modeling.
Proficiency in BI tools like Tableau or Thoughtspot; able to build scalable, intuitive dashboards from the ground up.
Experience collaborating with Data Science teams to build, deploy, and evaluate predictive models (e.g., forecasting, churn, LTV).
Familiarity with AI/ML applications in analytics, including generative AI (e.g., prompt engineering, LLMs), and AI-based tools for business decision support.
Self-starter with excellent communication and prioritization skills; comfortable managing projects with ambiguity and shifting priorities.

About the Role:

We’re on the lookout for a super-organised, people-savvy Creative Coordinator to join our creative team. You’ll be the go-to person for making sure everything flows smoothly - from the first brief to the final deliverable.

In this role, you’ll be right at the heart of it all: keeping projects on track, making sure our designers and copywriters know exactly what they’re working on, and bringing all the right people (and info!) together at the right time. You’ll work closely with teams across the business and support the Head of Creative & Content in keeping everything ticking along.

If you’re a natural organiser with a love for creativity, teamwork and a good to-do list, we’d love to hear from you.

Key Responsibilities:


Manage the day-to-day flow of incoming and outgoing creative briefs across the team.
Gather and clarify project details (timings, objectives, assets) by liaising with stakeholders across the business.
Brief the design and copywriting teams clearly and efficiently (with oversight from Head of Creative) ensuring creative output aligns with project goals.
Track the progress of creative projects and ensure deadlines are met.
Report to and support the Head of Creative & Content with day-to-day admin, project tracking, and team coordination.
Assist the Head of Creative and Retail Team in preparing and sending POS materials to print for our store network.
Provide occasional support to the Creative Production Team (e.g. assisting with production liaison between production team and creative team).
Maintain and update project management tools and calendars.
Support the Head of Creative in budget management, ensuring the whole team is tracking budgets efficiently.
Maintain records of freelancers we regularly work with, being the main point of contact for contracting them when projects arise.


What We’re Looking For:


Experience in a creative or marketing project coordination/management role (preferably agency).
Experience managing campaigns from inception through to production and delivery.
Strong organisational and time-management skills, with an eye for detail.
Excellent communication skills - you’ll be talking to multiple teams across the business.
Confidence in briefing creative teams and understanding the needs of design and copy.
A proactive mindset and the ability to solve problems before they become blockers.
Comfortable juggling multiple projects at once and working in a fast-paced environment.
A passion for creativity and a team-first attitude.


The Details


This is a full-time role, with four days a week in our Brighton office
You'll be working from an office with possibly the best sea view in Brighton.
Salary: £28,000 per year

Support the smooth delivery of projects by tracking progress and ensuring milestones are met communicating effectively with the client, suppliers and internal teams

Help with procurement tasks such as raising purchase and production orders
Keep CRM/ERP systems updated with current project and customer data
Communicate with the drawing team to request the creation and revision of technical drawings and documentation
Capture customer requirements, ensuring alignment with internal processes and product certifications
Act as a key point of contact for clients and suppliers, delivering clear and timely updates
Ensure a strong focus on logistics coordination, timely delivery, and client satisfaction.

Confidence working across technical drawings, schedules, and pricing systems (full training provided)
IT proficiency (Outlook, CRM systems, Microsoft Office)
A collaborative mindset, someone who thrives in a team environment
Desire to grow with the company and develop your technical knowledge


This would suit someone with experience in estimating, technical administration, project support, or even a recent graduate in construction, architecture or engineering looking to build their career.

Why Apply?


Unique exposure to prime and super-prime projects across central London
Fast-track development potential in a growing business
A flat, supportive structure with no micromanagement
A company that believes in doing things properly, from process to product

Are you passionate about improving our environment for this generation and those to follow? Are you ready to take on new challenges and collaborate with a future-focused team leading the way into new markets? Join Nexamp! 

This is where you can learn from industry leaders and become one yourself. It's fast-paced, mission-based work that challenges the status quo. Be on the team that's changing the world. 

What we’re looking for: 

We're looking for a Lead Data Analyst to craft insightful and compelling data stories, empower business owners across Nexamp to make more effective data-driven decisions, and help build our self-service data platform. As one of the nation’s largest and longest tenured solar and storage owner operators – and one of the few that is fully vertically integrated – our data is a differentiator in the market and a catalyst for future growth. You’ll be solving uniquely challenging data problems, alongside a strong team, and for a company in which the business model and mission are inseparably intertwined: our solar farms save customers money, help the planet, and are profitable for Nexamp and its investors. 

This role will be hybrid, based out of our Boston office, and you will report to the Director of Product, Data.

What you’ll do:  

Own and Deliver Data Products: Independently gather requirements for, prioritize, deliver, maintain, and continuously improve reusable data models, dashboards, analyses, A/B tests, and other data assets. Act as the product manager and implementer for your domain’s data offerings. Implement work using advanced SQL and BI tool skills. 
Be a Trusted Data Partner: Become the subject matter expert for data in your business areas. Identify opportunities for impact, proactively surface insights, support decision-making, and contribute to and influence business strategy and initiatives. Serve as your business stakeholders’ right hand. Support other business areas opportunistically.
Drive Data Quality, Documentation, and Engineering: Create and maintain comprehensive data documentation and communicate updates to your stakeholders. Write user stories or tickets for data engineering, validate data mapping, conduct QA, and implement data quality monitoring.
Foster Data Culture and Adoption: Monitor the usage of data assets, increase data literacy, and promote self-service through BI tools among stakeholders. Provide training, guidance, and support as needed.  
Collaborate Across the Data Team: Work within a centralized data team using agile methodologies. Collaborate with peer analysts through overlapping work, priority shifting, and code reviews to broaden your Nexamp knowledge.
Influence Data Strategy: Partner with the data architect, engineers, scientists, and analysts to shape the vision and roadmap for Nexamp’s data platform. Define and track annual OKRs to measure your impact.  

What you’ll bring: 

5-7 years of experience as a data analyst serving business owners and collaborating with data engineers (experience in the energy/construction industry is a plus, but not required) 
Advanced in SQL and BI tool administration and usage (experience with Databricks and Sigma are a plus, but not required) 
Strong track record of independently solving problems.
Commitment to Nexamp's mission and have a passion for solving tomorrow's climate crisis today.
Demonstrated experience in effectively communicating information, ideas, and perspectives with people inside and beyond your organization.   
Experience in showcasing initiative to make improvements to current work, processes, products, and services across the organization. We value accountability and an ownership mentality. 
Ability to ask appropriate questions, analyze data, identify the root causes of problems, and present creative solutions. 
Expertise in building strong internal and external relationships with customers and stakeholders, instilling trust and loyalty across the industry. 
Eagerness to develop a fundamental understanding of how Nexamp operates and then apply that knowledge effectively to inform business decisions.  

If you don’t meet 100% of the above qualifications, but see yourself contributing, please apply.

At Nexamp, our mission is to build the future of energy so it is clean, simple, and accessible for all. We are committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, veteran status, or any other basis protected by law. By encouraging a culture where ideas and decisions come from all people, we believe it will help us grow, innovate, and be a part of environmental and social change.

You’ll love working here because:  

Not only will you get to take part in meaningful work and have the chance to change the world alongside innovative, dedicated, and motivated peers, but you will also have access to all the benefits that Nexamp offers! This includes our competitive compensation package; a 401(k) employer-match; health, dental, and vision insurance starting day one; flexible paid time off and holiday PTO; commuter benefits, and cell phone reimbursement. We have headquarters in Boston, MA and Chicago, IL, in addition to growing offices nationwide. We provide healthy snacks, coffee, service days and other volunteer opportunities, company outings, and more!  

Nexamp's People team manages all aspects of recruitment and hiring within our organization. We want to inform third-party recruiters, staffing firms, and related agencies that Nexamp does not accept unsolicited resumes. Resumes will only be considered from these entities if a signed agreement is in place and the People team explicitly authorizes external recruiting assistance for a specific position. Any unsolicited resumes received will be deemed the property of Nexamp. We want to emphasize that Nexamp is not liable for any fees associated with unsolicited resumes.

Lumafield was founded in 2019 to upgrade manufacturing.




We are engineers with deep experience across the product development cycle, from initial ideas to shipping hardware, across industries and specializations, who became frustrated by the cost and complexity of modern manufacturing. So we decided to upgrade it.




Engineers make million-dollar decisions every day, and they need tools that give them the greatest possible insight into their products. By offering unprecedented visibility into products, as well as AI-driven tools that highlight problems and generate quantitative data, Lumafield promises to revolutionize the way complex products are created, manufactured, and used across industries. We started with industrial CT scanning, which for us was the most valuable but underutilized tool in the manufacturing toolbox, enabling us to rapidly inspect essential components non-destructively.




We rebuilt the whole system, from X-ray capture, to computer vision analysis, to web-based collaboration, to the entire business model, making the most advanced manufacturing tech more accessible to every industry. Our company, like our platform, is designed for upgrades. We’re building for greater intelligence, autonomy, and speed. For deeper vision, operational excellence, and powerful insights. And then we'll upgrade it all again.




Lumafield is headquartered in Cambridge, MA, and has an office in San Francisco, CA.




About the role:




The ideal candidate for this role comes from a Data Science background with startup experience working with systems. If you thrive on solving big business problems, love connecting the dots between technology and strategy, and want to see your ideas come to life across the entire organization, this is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. This role will be focused on providing critical insights to the business, as well as building and maintaining the required business systems, workflows, processes, and connections necessary to get those analyses up and running. As such, the role will require being comfortable handling a “full stack” of tasks at a high level, ranging from systems implementation, translating process requirements into systems requirements and vice versa, data engineering, and data analysis.




This role puts you at the heart of our company’s evolution, giving you the opportunity to shape how we work, make data-driven decisions, and deliver exceptional value to our customers and teams.




What you'll do:
Partner with leaders and teams across the business to uncover high-impact opportunities, translating real business needs into innovative system and data solutions that drive company growth and operational excellence
Improve or build new capabilities in existing business systems and hand off to system owners throughout the company
Champion process optimization by identifying and implementing both technology-driven and strategic improvements, ensuring our business stays agile and competitive
Maintain a stack of business systems and build integrations and connections between them as needed
Define and document these processes and workflows in process diagrams, wireframes, mapping documents, functional specifications, non-functional specifications, ERDs, use cases, user stories, and logical data models
Serve as a trusted advisor and trainer, equipping end users and stakeholders with the knowledge and tools they need to maximize the impact of our systems and insights
Project manage external systems consultants, where necessary




About you:
5-10 years of work experience in data analysis, business intelligence, and business systems
Strong SQL and proficient Python knowledge
Experience with data warehouse technical architectures, infrastructure components, ETL/ ELT and reporting/analytic tools
Experience in API integrations and data migration/data conversion.
Experience with data visualization tools and packages (e.g. Looker, Tableau, Power BI)
Experience implementing business systems, sometimes from scratch (including understanding business processes, gathering user requirements, design, testing, deployment, and training)
Must have the ability to communicate, motivate and organize projects throughout the company
Must have ability to work independently and handle end-to-end projects







Lumafield offers both competitive cash and equity compensation, as well as a health & wellness stipend, 401k, parental leave, flexible PTO, commuter benefits, company wide events and more! 




Lumafield is committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, because the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

About CyberArk:

CyberArk (NASDAQ: CYBR), is the global leader in Identity Security. Centered on privileged access management, CyberArk provides the most comprehensive security offering for any identity – human or machine – across business applications, distributed workforces, hybrid cloud workloads and throughout the DevOps lifecycle. The world’s leading organizations trust CyberArk to help secure their most critical assets. To learn more about CyberArk, visit our CyberArk blogs or follow us on X, LinkedIn or Facebook.

Job Description

CyberArk is seeking a Senior Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst with a passion for sales strategy and business insight to join our Business Analytics team. In this role, you will act as a strategic partner to Sales and Sales Operations leaders around the globe—translating data into compelling narratives that drive better, faster decisions. You’ll play a key role in shaping how performance is measured, understood, and improved across our global go-to-market (GTM) organization. While you’ll contribute to dashboard development and scalable reporting in Tableau, this role goes far beyond building reports—you’ll be expected to uncover trends, connect dots across complex datasets, and communicate insights in a way that resonates with non-technical audiences. The ideal candidate is a business-minded analyst with strong sales acumen, excellent communication skills, and an instinct for asking the right questions to get to the heart of the problem.

Responsibilities:



Serve as an embedded analytics partner to global Sales and Sales Operations stakeholders, proactively identifying opportunities to improve pipeline, productivity, and conversion
Craft clear, executive-ready narratives based on deep-dive analyses of sales performance, pipeline coverage, segmentation, and revenue trends
Translate complex data and technical concepts into actionable recommendations that are easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand and act upon
Design and evolve self-service dashboards and tools in Tableau that reduce friction and enable faster time-to-decision
Maintain a high bar for data accuracy and consistency across reports and ad hoc deliverables
Collaborate cross-functionally with Sales, RevOps, Marketing, Finance, and IT to align on business definitions and ensure reliable analytics infrastructure
Help drive a data-driven culture by enabling stakeholders to interpret KPIs and use insights effectively



Qualifications



4–6 years of experience in Sales Analytics, Sales Operations, Business Intelligence, or a related field
Proven ability to extract and communicate insights from complex data—especially in a Sales or GTM environment
Strong business judgment, with experience working directly with senior stakeholders and cross-functional teams
Working knowledge of SQL and experience with Tableau or a similar BI platform (depth of tool expertise less important than the ability to learn quickly)
Understanding of B2B sales metrics, pipeline stages, and CRM data (Salesforce experience a plus)
Excellent storytelling skills—both written and verbal—with the ability to tailor messages to executive and frontline audiences
Self-starter who thrives in a fast-paced, dynamic environment and isn’t afraid to ask questions or challenge assumptions
Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative or business-related field
Smart, bold but humble attitude to work collaboratively with CyberArk colleagues



Additional Information

CyberArk is an Equal Opportunity Employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or protected Veteran status.

We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of employment Visa at this time.

The salary range for this position is $87,000 – $121,000/year, plus commissions or discretionary bonus, which will be based on the employee’s performance. Base pay may also vary considerably depending on job-related knowledge, skills, and experience.
