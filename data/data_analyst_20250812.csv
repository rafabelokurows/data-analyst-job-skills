However, steep entry barriers, including high minimum investments (~€10m), hefty paperwork and the challenge of selecting the right fund have traditionally kept individual investors at bay, with access largely limited to big institutions or a select few.

Enter Moonfare.

We've made investing in private equity more accessible and straightforward with our fully digital investment platform. Now, qualified investors can access some of the most sought-after private market funds at lower minimum investment amounts*.

The diverse Moonfare team – which includes alumni from top private banks, groundbreaking startups and beyond – is united in pushing boundaries and redefining the private equity landscape.

Join us!

You'll be part of a small, high impact team that sits at the intersection of data engineering, product, marketing, and commercial, enabling the business through actionable insights, scalable reporting, and high quality data models.

You will shape how we understand performance, measure success, and identify new opportunities across the company. Your work will help ensure that decisions at Moonfare are always backed by clear, well structured, and meaningful data.

Advocate for data quality and consistency, ensuring models and reporting are accurate, well documented, and easily understood
Collaborate with the wider data and analytics team to improve data infrastructure and analytics tooling
Drive initiatives that increase data literacy and empower teams to use data more effectively


The next Moonfarian:


Has 5–7 years of experience as a Data, Product, or Marketing Analyst
Has a proven track record of transforming data infrastructure and metrics to support business growth
Possesses advanced SQL skills (BigQuery, PostgreSQL), along with strong Spreadsheet and Tableau proficiency; experience with dbt and Snowflake is a plus
Has hands-on experience working with commercial, product, or marketing datasets
Is comfortable designing and interpreting A/B tests and leading experimentation efforts

Our Values:


Our clients come first, Moonfare comes second, and we prioritise ourselves third - Client-Centric Focus. Putting clients first means creating value for them is essential. Placing Moonfare second signifies that our individual professional future at Moonfare depends on the company's commercial success. Prioritising ourselves third reflects our humility in putting clients and Moonfare before personal interests.
We pursue excellence and honor our promises - Commitment to Excellence. We hold ourselves to the highest standards, taking responsibility for our failures, and celebrating our successes. We commit to deadlines and stick to them and we learn from our mistakes.
We are here to win and to celebrate our collective achievements - Win together. We are mission-focused and think and act like owners. We exemplify the attitude we expect and each of us commits to do what it takes to succeed.
We foster personal growth but each of us earns our place as a Moonfarian through merit - Growth and Merit. We hire, retain, and develop exceptional people and invest in empowering them to excel. We must all earn our place at the table every day.


We understand the important role that diversity plays in our success. Different backgrounds, experiences and ideas push us further and raise the bar. We're committed to developing an inclusive and safe culture where everyone — regardless of colour, race, religion, sex, origin, sexuality, disability, marital status, citizenship or gender identity — knows that they are an integral part of the team and can bring their full potential to their work.


Minimum investments vary according to jurisdiction.

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved.

Your Challenge

As a Data Analyst in our Product Analytics team, you will play a key role in shaping data-informed decision-making across multiple mission teams.

Partnering with Product Managers, Engineers, Designers, and other cross-functional stakeholders, you will use data to uncover insights about user behavior across both our customer-facing products and internal tools.

Your Responsibilities


Analyze user behavior and product usage to uncover trends, pain points, and opportunities.
Define and track key product metrics to measure feature performance and business impact.
Translate complex data into clear, compelling narratives and share insights with a range of stakeholders.
Build dashboards to enable self-serve analytics across the organization, and also up-skill your stakeholders.
Collaborate with the Analytics Engineering to improve our data sources and self-serve solution.


Your Profile


2+ years of experience in a data analytics role, ideally within a product or tech environment
Ability to translate complex data into clear insights and actionable recommendations.
Good communication skills and ability to work with stakeholders across all levels.
Excellent SQL skills.
Experience with data visualization and reporting tools (e.g. Looker, Mixpanel, Tableau).
Keen interest in AI’s potential, paired with hands-on experimentation and solid conceptual understanding of generative-AI tools.


Nice To Have


Experience with A/B testing and Python are plus.
Data modelling and dbt knowledge are a plus.


Why Taxfix?


A chance to do meaningful, people-centric work with an international team of passionate professionals.
Holistic well-being with free mental health coaching sessions and yoga.
A monthly allowance to spend on an extensive range of services that you can use and roll over as flexibly as you like.

30 annual vacation days and flexible working hours.
A generous learning budget to support your personal and professional development and guidance from our internal L&D experts.
Work from abroad for up to six weeks every year. Just align with your team, and then enjoy your trip.
Plenty of opportunities to socialise as a team. In addition to internal tech meetups, our international team hosts regular get-togethers—virtually and in person when possible.

About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

Job Description

We are on the lookout for a Staff Product Analyst to join the Consumer Product Analytics team on our journey to always deliver amazing experiences.

At Delivery Hero, you’ll shape the global consumer experience for millions of users. Your work will have a direct impact on how we attract and retain customers, creating data-driven, personalized interactions that keep them coming back. As part of our Consumer Team, you’ll enhance customer satisfaction and drive global growth and profitability through innovative projects.

The Consumer Product Analytics Team drives product strategy and innovation by providing actionable insights on customers and products, contributing to business success. In this role, you'll have the opportunity to shape the experience for millions of users across our worldwide portfolio of platforms (FoodPanda, Pedidos Ya, Woowa, Yemeksepeti, Foodora, Talabat, HungerStation, eFood, and Glovo), directly impacting customer satisfaction and driving growth. Our diverse team of data professionals is based in Berlin, working closely with product directors, product managers, engineers, and business stakeholders to directly influence product direction. We collaborate with a larger data team, including data engineers, data scientists, and ML engineers, to share knowledge and expertise.

At Consumer Product Analytics, you will have the opportunity to access high volume, rich user behavior data, engage in end to end product development cycles, work on complex product problems, and learn from many experienced data professionals.

The main responsibilities of the Product Analytics Team include:


Strategic Impact & Product Leadership: Act as a key strategic data partner to product leadership, influencing product roadmap and investment decisions through deep analytical insights and foresight. Proactively identify high-impact analytical opportunities to drive significant customer satisfaction and business growth.
Advanced Experimentation & Causal Inference: Design, implement, and rigorously analyze A/B tests and other experimental designs (e.g., multi-variate, quasi-experiments) with a strong emphasis on advanced statistical methods for robust hypothesis validation, accurate impact measurement, and understanding causal relationships. Drive the standardization and continuous improvement of our experimentation framework across multiple brands.
Metric Framework & OKR Ownership: Define, establish, and own comprehensive product metric frameworks and quarterly OKRs. Drive alignment on ""what good looks like"" across product teams, ensuring clear, measurable goals that align with strategic business outcomes.
Data Integrity & Tracking Excellence: Take ownership of tracking definition and work closely with various Delivery Hero brands to significantly improve the reliability, consistency, and completeness of user behavior tracking for our discovery tools. Proactively identify and resolve data quality issues at scale.
Scalable ETL & Reporting Solutions: Design, build, and maintain robust data pipelines and self-service dashboards, ensuring data accessibility and empowering product teams to make data-driven decisions independently.
Deep Dive & Exploratory Analysis: Conduct complex, end-to-end exploratory analyses on large-scale user behavior data (transactional, clickstream, etc.) to uncover non-obvious insights, identify root causes of trends, and directly inform product strategy and roadmap development.
Technical & Mentorship Leadership: Contribute significantly to the growth and development of fellow product analysts through knowledge sharing sessions, best practice dissemination, workflow optimizations, and active participation in hiring and onboarding processes. Champion and drive analytical excellence within the team and broader organization.


Qualifications


9+ years of experience in product analytics or a related data-focused role, preferably within rapidly growing and dynamic environments, and with a broad mission scope or multiple stakeholders.
Experience working in Search & Recommendations systems.
Expert proficiency in SQL and Python for complex data manipulation, analysis, and modeling. Experience with BigQuery and large-scale cloud data warehousing concepts is a strong plus.
Expertise in statistical methods applied to experimental design (A/B testing, multivariate tests, etc.), causal inference, and robust hypothesis validation. You should be able to navigate complex statistical challenges and explain methodologies clearly.
Extensive experience working with large-scale user behavior data (e.g., transactional, clickstream, app usage), including data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to derive actionable insights.
Proficiency with at least one data visualization tool such as Looker Studio (Data Studio), Tableau, QlikView, or Power BI, with a proven ability to create compelling and insightful dashboards.
Demonstrated ability to influence and collaborate with multiple stakeholders, including senior product managers, engineers, and business leaders. You can clearly communicate complex analytical findings and successfully drive large-scale analytics projects end-to-end (e.g., defining success metrics for a tribe, standardizing measurement across brands, or implementing new experimentation methodologies).
Experience with customer behavior tracking platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, MixPanel, Snowplow, Segment, Tealium).


Nice to have:


Experience with Airflow, DBT, or other data pipelining tools
Familiarity with recommender systems, ML models, or ranking algorithms
Experience scaling analytics processes or experimentation programs across multiple teams or brands.

Build and maintain isolated, regionalized data warehouse infrastructure for use in customer facing features.
Develop data tools for improving policy performance, such as training ML models on historical data and backtesting at scale.
Design and develop scalable and network optimized RESTful APIs using Python on AWS, leveraging services such as Lambda, S3, SQL and Parquet.
Optimize data warehouse efficiency, conduct peer code reviews, and produce technical documentation.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams in an Agile environment to translate business requirements into technical solutions.


Requirements:


Minimum of 5 years of experience in Python and SQL
Prior experience in Data Engineering/Data Viz/Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence

Experience in Python, FastAPI
Expertise in data engineering topics, SQL, parquet
Experience with AWS services and serverless architectures.


What we offer:


Work with colleagues that lift you up, challenge you, celebrate you and help you grow. We come from many different backgrounds, but what we have in common is the desire to operate at the very top of our fields. If you are similarly capable, caring, and driven, you'll find yourself at home here.
Make an impact and meaningfully shape an early-stage company.
Experience a truly flat hierarchy and communicate directly with founding team members. Having an opinion and voicing your ideas is not only welcome but encouraged, especially when they challenge the status quo.
Learn from experienced mentors and achieve tremendous personal and professional growth. Get to know and leverage our network of leading tech investors and advisors around the globe.
Receive a top-of-market equity and cash compensation package.
Get access to a self-development budget you can use to e.g. attend conferences, buy books or take classes.
Receive a new Apple MacBook Pro, as well as meaningful home office set-up.


Our stance:


We're eager to meet talented and driven candidates regardless of whether they tick all the boxes. We're looking for someone who will add to our culture, not just fit within it. We strongly encourage individuals from groups traditionally underestimated and underrepresented in tech to apply
We seek to actively recognize and combat racism, sexism, ableism and ageism. We embrace and support all gender identities and expressions, and celebrate love in its many forms. We won't inquire about how you identify or if you've experienced discrimination, but if you want to tell your story, we are all ears

Here’s what makes someone a great fit for this role (and for this moment at Cricut):

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Sound like something you’d like to be a part of? We’d love to hear from you!

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.

To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.


What we look for
Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.


What we offer
Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.


Commitment & contract
Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time or part-time.

Location
Milan (Italy), London (UK).

The selection process
If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests designed to assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. They’re challenging and may take several hours to complete. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.

We set the bar high and won't extend an offer until we're convinced we've found the right candidate. This is why a job may stay open for months or be reposted several times.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and provide reasonable accommodations for an individual with disabilities—just let us know through this form.

Before you apply
If you’ve applied before but didn't receive an offer, we recommend waiting at least one year before applying again.

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment. We’re extremely ambitious and we hold ourselves—and one another—to a high standard. While this tends to lead to extraordinary learning, achievement, and career growth, it also requires significant commitment.

To help you ramp up quickly and set yourself up for success, we recommend spending your first few months working from our Milan office, regardless of your long-term work location. It’s the best way to rapidly absorb our company culture and build trust with your new teammates. We’ll support you with generous travel and accommodation assistance. After that, you’re welcome to work from our offices in Milan or London, or remotely from approved countries—depending on what we agree at the offer stage.

If the role speaks to you and you’re excited to give your best, we’d love to hear from you. Apply now—we can’t wait to meet you.

An extraordinary job. Done by someone like you.

HM Prison officer opportunities

HMP Guys Marsh

£33,746 - £38,003

Prison officers protect the public and help to make a positive impact on people’s lives.

If you have the integrity, skills and strength of character we’re looking for, this fast-paced role could be the start of a successful career. No two days or situations are ever the same. And, as you gain experience, you’ll find a range of opportunities to grow and develop into.

Someone like you

There’s no such thing as a typical prison officer. Our people come from different walks of life, just like the offenders they work with. Whether you’re a parent, a teacher, have worked in retail or the armed forces, you’ll have developed the empathy, self-confidence and great communication skills we expect.

No matter the challenge, you’ll take the time to build constructive, positive and professional relationships with offenders who could be at the lowest point in their lives.

Teamwork plays a vital role in this environment, so you’ll need to be fully committed to supporting your colleagues and understand the importance of acting as one team to keep the prison, offenders and everyone who works here safe.

You will be required to work various shifts and weekends.

An extraordinary job

In this unique career, you’ll have the opportunity to carry out many different roles in any one day. One minute you’re a peacekeeper, the next you’re a counsellor or a teacher. You’ll work directly with prisoners in a unique environment, helping to protect the public and make a positive impact.

What You Can Expect From Us

You’ll be given great training and opportunities for progression and development - including the chance to specialise in different areas.

There’s a good salary to look forward to, as well as 25 days’ holiday allowance each year, childcare vouchers, season ticket loans, retail discounts, Employee Assistance Programme and Cycle to Work scheme.

The rewards aren’t all you’ll gain from a role in the prison service. There’s the sense of achievement you feel when you’ve helped an offender to get their life back on track - the kind of experience you simply won’t find anywhere else.

How To Apply

If the qualities in this role sound like you, apply now.

An extraordinary job. Done by someone like you.

HM Prison officer opportunities

HMP Guys Marsh

£33,746 - £38,003

Prison officers protect the public and help to make a positive impact on people’s lives.

If you have the integrity, skills and strength of character we’re looking for, this fast-paced role could be the start of a successful career. No two days or situations are ever the same. And, as you gain experience, you’ll find a range of opportunities to grow and develop into.

Someone like you

There’s no such thing as a typical prison officer. Our people come from different walks of life, just like the offenders they work with. Whether you’re a parent, a teacher, have worked in retail or the armed forces, you’ll have developed the empathy, self-confidence and great communication skills we expect.

No matter the challenge, you’ll take the time to build constructive, positive and professional relationships with offenders who could be at the lowest point in their lives.

Teamwork plays a vital role in this environment, so you’ll need to be fully committed to supporting your colleagues and understand the importance of acting as one team to keep the prison, offenders and everyone who works here safe.

You will be required to work various shifts and weekends.

An extraordinary job

In this unique career, you’ll have the opportunity to carry out many different roles in any one day. One minute you’re a peacekeeper, the next you’re a counsellor or a teacher. You’ll work directly with prisoners in a unique environment, helping to protect the public and make a positive impact.

What You Can Expect From Us

You’ll be given great training and opportunities for progression and development - including the chance to specialise in different areas.

There’s a good salary to look forward to, as well as 25 days’ holiday allowance each year, childcare vouchers, season ticket loans, retail discounts, Employee Assistance Programme and Cycle to Work scheme.

The rewards aren’t all you’ll gain from a role in the prison service. There’s the sense of achievement you feel when you’ve helped an offender to get their life back on track - the kind of experience you simply won’t find anywhere else.

How To Apply

If the qualities in this role sound like you, apply now.

That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Pay and benefits

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements



Travel:-

Quince was started to challenge the existing idea that nice things should cost a lot. Our mission was simple: create an item of equal or greater quality than the leading luxury brands and sell them at a much lower price.

OUR VALUES

Customer First. Customer satisfaction is our highest priority.

High Quality. True quality is a combination of premium materials and high production standards that everyone can feel good about.

Essential design. We don't chase trends, and we don't sell everything. We're expert curators that find the very best and bring it to you at the lowest prices.

Always a better deal. Through innovation and real price transparency we want to offer the best deal to both our customers and our factory partners.

Environmentally and Socially conscious. We're committed to sustainable materials and sustainable production methods. That means a cleaner environment and fair wages for factory workers.

OUR TEAM AND SUCCESS

Quince is a retail and technology company co-founded by a team that has extensive experience in retail, technology and building early stage companies. You'll work with a team of world-class talent from Stanford GSB, Google, D.E. Shaw, Stitch Fix, Urban Outfitters, Wayfair, McKinsey, Nike etc.

THE IDEAL CANDIDATE:

As an eCommerce Data Analyst, you'll play a critical role in planning, measuring, analyzing, optimizing our marketing, operations and revenue driving programs for our Canada market. You'll work closely with our performance marketing, data, merchandising and product teams to deliver data-driven insights and strategic recommendations. Your expertise in analyzing large datasets, interpreting trends, and translating them into actionable insights will help us make smarter, faster, and more effective marketing decisions.

Analyze customer behavior, conversion funnels, and on-site metrics (e.g., CTR, CVR, bounce rate) to identify opportunities to improve product discovery and conversion.
Provide cross-channel marketing insights (paid search, social, display, email, affiliate) to optimize campaigns and drive ROAS, CAC, and LTV goals.
Partner with merchandising to uncover bundling trends, product affinities, and inventory insights that inform upsell and cross-sell strategies.
Design and evaluate A/B and incrementality tests to optimize creative, targeting, and media mix performance.
Forecast marketing and revenue performance for weekly, monthly, and quarterly planning cycles.
Build dashboards and automate reporting to deliver real-time insights for marketing, merchandising, and leadership teams.
Monitor inventory demand alignment to prevent stock outs from impacting campaign success.
Perform ad hoc analysis and post-mortems to quantify business impact and inform future marketing and site strategies.
Conduct deep-dive analysis of Canadian customer behavior and attribution to surface local growth opportunities in acquisition, retention, and cross-sell.


REQUIREMENTS:


Bachelor's degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Mathematics, Economics, Data Science, or similar). Master's degree is a plus.
5+ years in a data analytics role, ideally with a focus on performance or digital marketing within an e-commerce or technology company.
Proficiency in SQL and data visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Looker, Power BIm Mixpanel).
Knowledge of statistical analysis and A/B testing; familiarity with Python or R is a plus.
Ability to interpret complex data and translate it into actionable insights, with a focus on detail, accuracy, and clarity.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills, with the ability to present data insights and recommendations effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Conduct deep-dive investigations into user journeys and product funnels to identify pain points and areas for improvement.
Build and maintain robust, automated dashboards and reporting systems to provide visibility into product health and performance for stakeholders at all levels.




Technical Leadership & Mentorship:

Champion data best practices and raise the bar for data quality and analytical rigor across the organization.
Collaborate with Data Engineering to design and build scalable, high-quality data pipelines and data models that support analytical needs.
Mentor junior analysts and other team members, providing guidance on analytical techniques, experimental design, and technical skills.

Exceptional Communication & Storytelling: The ability to distill complex analytical concepts into clear, concise, and compelling narratives for both technical and non-technical audiences.
Leadership & Influence: Proven ability to influence and lead without direct authority, driving consensus and action from cross-functional teams and senior leadership.
Strategic & Critical Thinking: The ability to think strategically, solve ambiguous problems, and move from data to insights to actionable recommendations.
Autonomy & Proactiveness: A self-starter who can manage complex projects from inception to completion with minimal oversight.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We’re looking for an experienced data analyst to deepen our understanding around the economic impact Stripe is having globally. You will be part of a community of analysts and data scientists on the Go-to-Market Analytics team, and you will partner with Stripe’s Communications, Policy, and Marketing teams to build and protect Stripe’s brand and influence across the world.

What you’ll do

Stripe has a unique view of the world, with real-time insight into changing trends, industries, and cross-border commerce. The Data Analyst, Communications & Policy role will focus on constructing and analyzing data, built upon robust data pipelines and a strong data architecture, to demonstrate how Stripe enables broad and often surprising economic growth. This role will help tease out novel economic insights from Stripe data to tell stories about how pockets of the economy are evolving, and how Stripe is advancing economic opportunity and increasing the GDP of the internet.

Responsibilities


Partner with the Communications, Policy and Marketing teams to imagine, scope, and lead research projects that bring to life different facets of Stripe’s economic impact
Design, implement and maintain data pipelines and dashboards to generate insights from Stripe internal and external public data sources
Define and monitor key economic impact metrics
Go deep on understanding business drivers, user segments, cohorts and macroeconomic trends
Prepare presentations, analyses and visualizations for internal and external executive audiences
Partner closely with Communications, Policy, Marketing and Product teams to identify and analyze key trends and produce thought leadership pieces and campaign content leveraging Stripe data
Collaborate with external vendors, academics, and think tanks to advance Stripe’s research agenda and advocacy positions



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytical roles working with large datasets
Bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Experience building and maintaining data pipelines using a distributed data framework (e.g. Hadoop, Spark)
Experience building self-serve dashboards or other scalable analytical tools for partner teams
Strong knowledge of statistics
Experience developing data-informed narratives and visualizations for external publication
Demonstrated experience of and interest in the public discussion of economic trends (whether as a data scientist, writer, researcher, or in another capacity)
Demonstrated ability to lead and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Outstanding written and verbal communication skills



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, Sciences or a related quantitative field and/or experience in working on data analytics in the tech field
Experience working with institutions that are respected by policymakers and the wider public for their economic insight
Familiarity with survey design and analysis



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We believe that each Viking is unique and brings exponential value to the company.

About the Role:

Big Viking Games is looking for a Staff Product Data Analyst to join our team and own analytics for our flagship titles—YoWorld and FishWorld. Embedded within our cross-functional product pods, you'll partner with Product, Marketing, FP&A and Data to: evaluate player behaviour, refine monetization strategies, and architect predictive models, revenue forecasts, and agentic workflows that automate key live-ops processes.

Reporting into the Product org, this Staff-level role is ideal for someone who thrives in a fast-paced, hypothesis-driven environment and wants their dashboards, forecasts and automation to directly impact millions of players.

You'll help drive smarter decisions across roadmap planning, feature development, campaign performance, and in-game economy optimization—while championing first-principles analytics, machine-learning pipelines, and self-serve data automation.

What You'll Do:


End-to-end analytics & modelling
Build and maintain dashboards (DAU, player spend, content performance, pricing effectiveness) for stakeholders across Product, Marketing and Finance
Analyze player behaviour, campaign performance and monetization trends to inform roadmap and live-ops tuning
Develop predictive models and forecasting pipelines (e.g. adoption curves, revenue projections, churn risk) using first-principles thinking.
Impact & experimentation
Lead A/B test design, impact analysis and lift measurement for Gem Events, Challenges, Reactivation Offers and new gameplay features (ex. SplashO, Storylines)
Partner with FP&A to quantify cost savings and migration impacts
Automation & scalability
Identify inefficiencies in IAP config, asset throughput and content velocity—recommend and build agentic workflows to streamline campaign planning and delivery
Collaborate with Data Engineering to operationalize data pipelines, enable self-serve analytics and embed predictive insights into product dashboards.
Cross-functional thought partnership
Translate complex quantitative findings into clear, actionable recommendations for PMs, engineers and live-ops leads
Evangelize next-gen analytics best practices, mentor junior analysts and shape our data-driven culture


Requirements

The Must-Haves:


6+ years in product, business or game analytics—ideally in mobile or live-ops gaming
Expert SQL skills; ability to wrangle messy data into clean, performant datasets
Proficiency in Python or R and experience with ML libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)
Hands-on experience building and maintaining BI dashboards (Looker, Tableau, Power BI or similar)
Ability to blend descriptive analytics (""What happened? Why?"") with predictive insight (""What will happen? How can we optimize?"")
Proven track record applying first-principles thinking to build and validate forecasting and predictive models that drove measurable product or revenue impact (validating assumptions, testing holdout samples, iterating on feature engineering)
Ability to translate complex data insights into concise stories and actionable recommendations


The Nice-To-Haves:


Experience with in-game economy design or IAP configuration.
Familiarity with A/B testing frameworks (Optimizely, Firebase, custom tooling).
Background in automated data pipelines and agentic workflow tools.
Master's degree in a quantitative field (Statistics, Economics, Computer Science) or equivalent experience.

Cricut is in a powerful chapter of transformation. We’re evolving fast—refining our strategy, growing our teams, and raising the bar across the board. This is an incredible opportunity for the right kind of person—but it’s not for everyone.

We’re looking for A-players—people who don’t just meet expectations, but consistently exceed them. If you thrive in dynamic environments and find joy in turning challenges into momentum, keep reading.

Here’s what makes someone a great fit for this role (and for this moment at Cricut):

You have a bias for urgency.

You don’t wait for perfect clarity to take action—you start, learn, and adjust. You believe that speed matters, especially when paired with thoughtfulness. You ask: “What can move forward today?” and push past inertia.

You set high standards—especially for yourself.

You’re proud of your work and protective of your reputation. You take ownership, deliver quality, and don’t cut corners. You hold yourself accountable without waiting to be asked.

You stay focused when things are moving fast.

You can identify what really matters and don’t get distracted by noise. You prioritize well, and manage your time wisely.

You collaborate like a pro.

You elevate the people around you, communicate clearly, and give thoughtful feedback. You’re low ego, high output—and your team loves working with you.

Remote (+/- 4.5 hours from Pacific Time) or in-lab (Surrey, BC, Canada)
Compensation: CAD $80k-95k plus options, based on your skills, qualifications and level of relevant experience
Benefits package
Support for professional development




Who we’re looking for:

We are seeking a skilled Data Integration Specialist with strong enterprise coding abilities and experience handling large volumes of diverse datasets. You should be comfortable working with clients to understand their data landscape and technical constraints, mapping data to our platform, and developing robust, scalable data pipelines. We value teammates who are collaborative, detail-oriented, and proactive in troubleshooting and improving data processes. You would relish a position where your work will play a key role in enabling the global transition to clean energy, supporting a more sustainable future.




Key qualities:

Strong enterprise coding skills (Python preferred)
Strong data munging skills
Experience with libraries and technologies for processing large datasets in a wide variety of formats (CSV, parquet, JSON, XML, GDB, etc.)
Strong data privacy and security mindset and habits
Good SQL proficiency
Experience with cloud storage tools (e.g. AWS S3, Azure Blob, etc.)
Excellent communication and client interaction skills
Willingness to travel for client engagements as needed (Awesense has business globally)
Problem-solving mindset and ability to work in a team environment

Nice-to-have:

Familiarity with geospatial, network, or time series data and/or electrical-utility data is a plus
Experience with cloud provider data pipeline management tools (e.g. AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory, Apache Airflow, etc.) and overall cloud analytics platforms (e.g. Azure Fabric)
Experience using software in containers (e.g. Docker)
Familiarity with data science notebooks (e.g. Jupyter)




Who we are:

Our goal is to transform the planet into one that is fuelled by modern, reliable and clean energy.  For over a decade we’ve helped utilities & energy providers optimize and modernize their grid through our cloud-based grid analytics solutions.




The problem we’re solving:

The electrical grid was designed for a one-way flow of energy, with generation at the top and consumption at the edges. To enable clean energy on the scale required to address climate change (decarbonization), the grid of tomorrow needs to allow for distributed energy sources (DERs), in the form of clean generation (e.g. solar), storage (e.g. batteries) and electric vehicles, that can reside anywhere in the grid (decentralization). To achieve that, digitalization is key. Many disparate data sources must be brought together and their validity ensured so that smart-grid applications can be built on top.  At Awesense, we have built some of these applications ourselves. Our current goal is providing a digital layer via an API-based energy data platform so that other solution providers, partners, and even energy companies can easily build such applications on top of it – and performance at scale is paramount. We want you to help with this as part of our services team.




Main responsibilities:
Client Engagement:
Talk with clients to understand what data they collect—including geospatial, graph/network, and time series data—in which systems, and how it can be extracted.
Identify data relationships and constraints, and business rules that must be enforced.
Determine the best way to map the client’s data to the Awesense data model, cross-referencing the different data types.
Data Integration Development:
Write code to retrieve data from source or intermediate systems.
Validate data against defined constraints.
Transform and cross-link data according to the mapping and prepare for ingestion.
Call Awesense REST APIs to push data into the platform.
Use Awesense REST & SQL APIs to retrieve, cross-reference, or validate previously ingested data.
Pipeline Management:
Develop code for both one-time ingestion and, importantly, ongoing data ingestion pipelines.
Ensure code is robust to errors and provides comprehensive logging and reporting.
Monitor, troubleshoot, and improve data pipelines.
Collaboration:
Work with teammates for code review and quality assurance.




What you’ll assist with:
Work with the client manager to report issues back to clients and iterate on solutions as needed.
Help improve data integration processes and tools.
When not working on client projects, assist either with platform development or implementing use cases on top of the platform APIs

﻿

What you’ll learn:
Problems and emerging solutions around grid decarbonization and the future-of-energy analytics sector.




What steps to expect once joining us:
First 3 months - onboarding, learning and first hands-on development
Meet your teammates and understand the company culture and workflows.
Learn about the Awesense domain and platform, data model, and REST/SQL APIs.
Alongside an existing Awesense team member, begin working on a client project to understand their data sources and integration needs and develop initial code for data mapping and transformation for ingestions.
Participate in code reviews and receive feedback to align with team standards.
By 6 months - expanded responsibilities
Take ownership of ongoing data ingestion pipelines, ensuring robustness and reliability.
Implement comprehensive logging, error handling, and monitoring solutions for data pipelines.
Report issues and progress to clients, iterating on solutions as needed.
Work closely with teammates on QA processes and contribute to improving integration workflows.
Deepen expertise in handling large datasets, especially geospatial, network, and time series data, and cloud-based integration solutions.
By 1 year- full project ownership:
Lead complex ongoing data integration projects from client onboarding to deployment and maintenance.
Proactively identify opportunities to optimize data pipelines and improve platform integration.
Support and mentor junior team members, sharing best practices and coding standards.
Collaborate with product and engineering teams to influence future platform features and data capabilities.
Become a key technical advisor on data integration matters.




Awesense is committed to building an inclusive, diverse, and equitable workplace. We welcome applicants of all backgrounds, genders and ethnicities. Your unique perspectives and ideas are valued here.

Only principals, no recruiters or agencies please.

Remote work okay! Must have legal entitlement to work in Canada and be able to pass a background check.
