Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Experience working with customers delivering high quality research analyses.
Ability to learn and adapt quickly in a dynamic start-up environment.

Partner Across Teams:


Collaborate with Database Analysts, Subject Matter Experts, and Project Analysts to ensure dashboards are accurate, timely, and actionable.
Liaise with Backend Analysts on data infrastructure needs, supporting the delivery of reliable, quality data.


Champion Continuous Improvement:


Gather and synthesize feedback to iterate on dashboard designs and reporting approaches.
Embrace experimentation and learning, viewing challenges as opportunities to innovate.


Support, Document, and Train:


Provide support for dashboard users, troubleshoot issues, and document best practices.
Contribute to user guides and training sessions, helping others unlock the power of data at DaVita Revenue Operations (ROPS).


Required Skills & Experience


Demonstrated success translating data into business insights and actionable recommendations.
Experience working with dashboards and visualizations, ideally using Tableau or a similar BI platform.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, able to understand and tell the story behind the numbers.
Technical acumen, comfortable working with data, whether through SQL queries, Excel, or other relevant tools.
Excellent communication, relationship-building, and partner engagement skills.
A learning mindset and the drive to continually expand your skills and knowledge.


Preferred Qualifications


Advanced Tableau experience, including design, calculations, and interactivity.
Experience working in healthcare analytics or revenue cycle operations.
Familiarity with SQL, ETL, data modeling, or modern data warehousing concepts.
Background in process improvement, change management, or agile project delivery.
Experience supporting or training business users in BI solutions.

We’re looking for platform experts who thrive on structure, strategy, and solving.

We’re looking for a Social Listening & Insights Analyst who brings more than just monitoring skills—you bring the ability to uncover meaningful insights from complex social data and connect them to the bigger picture. Working within a large matrixed tech environment, you’ll help transform how we use social listening to inform business and marketing decisions across priority customer solution areas (CSAs).

You’ll support both planned and ad hoc reporting, contributing to a stronger insights-driven culture. This role is ideal for someone who’s both analytical and curious, with the drive to not just report on trends—but to ask better questions, spot patterns, and tell stories with data that shape strategy.

This person would join the Designit team that supports Microsoft Cloud Marketing, Blog, and Social. This world-class social team operates 100+ social media channels and 20+ marketing blogs designed for developers, IT decision makers, IT implementers, and business decision makers. Each month, we publish over 3,000 posts to help, inform, entertain, and engage across the globe. Azure, Power BI, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 are just a few examples of the innovative products and services that comprise the ecosystem.

What You’ll Do

Own and deliver recurring and ad hoc social listening reports across CSAs, tailored to specific campaign, brand, or business priorities.
Translate social data into clear, actionable insights that drive decisions—beyond just volume metrics.
Provide point-in-time analysis during key launches, events, or spikes in conversation.
Surface sentiment trends, audience behaviors, competitor comparisons, and whitespace opportunities.
Partner closely with social media managers, strategists, and ops leads to align reporting with campaign and business objectives.
Act as a thought partner—not just a report generator—by proactively identifying insight opportunities and storylines.
Help evolve our reporting frameworks, storytelling formats, and listening taxonomies over time.
Stay current on industry tools, best practices, and emerging technologies in the listening and analytics space.

What You’ll Bring

3–5+ years of experience in social listening, digital analytics, or insights—ideally in agency, tech, or global brand settings.
Hands-on expertise with social listening tools (Sprinklr highly preferred, or others like Talkwalker, Brandwatch, NetBase, etc.).
Strong data analysis and synthesis skills; comfort with interpreting both quantitative and qualitative social data.
Ability to craft clear insights and deliver them in visually engaging and executive-friendly ways.
A sense of curiosity—asking “why” behind the data and seeking broader patterns or implications.
Experience working across multiple stakeholders and managing multiple requests at once in a fast-paced environment.
Solid understanding of the social landscape—platform nuances, content formats, and conversation patterns.
Bonus: familiarity with tagging structures, taxonomy building, or integration with broader research teams.

Why This Role Is Exciting

Social data has never been more valuable—but it’s only as powerful as the insights we draw from it. In this role, you’ll help elevate the way our team listens, understands, and acts on what our audiences are saying. You’ll play a critical part in shaping strategy, guiding content, and keeping a pulse on what matters most across one of the world’s leading tech brands.







Compensation: $100000K - $110000K




Would you like to join a global organization that.

Supports well-being, realistically. We understand the always-on nature of social, and while work-life balance isn’t perfect every day, we aim to support our team with flexibility, transparency and trust
Fosters a global culture of learning and advocacy. We believe diversity of thought, background, and experience strengthens our collective impact.

Adapts to change with agility. Change is constant, and we value team members who see it as an opportunity, not a disruption
Recognizes the power of collaboration. We reward team-minded thinking and cross-functional partnership.
Remote-first mindset. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our team, with remote work, virtual interviews, and virtual onboarding remaining in place for the foreseeable future.

Experience leading experimentation, statistical analysis, and sophisticated measurement (e.g. causal inference) E2E to guide decision making.
Hands-on experience with BI/Visualization tools (Looker, Tableau, PowerBI, etc).
Experience building metric frameworks to understand user behaviors.

The User Operations team is central to ensuring that our customers' experience with our products is nothing short of exceptional. We resolve complex issues, provide technical guidance, and support customers in maximizing value and adoption from deploying our products. We work closely with Sales, Technical Success, Product, Engineering and others to deliver the best possible experience to our customers at scale. OpenAI's customers represent a range of diverse backgrounds and maturity, from early-stage startups to established global enterprises. Given OpenAI’s breakneck shipping cadence and growth—and the expectation that it will only accelerate—transforming our rich support data into real‑time insights and scalable, self‑serve analytics is critical to sustaining exceptional customer experiences on the path to AGI.

About The Role

We’re seeking a User Operations Data Analyst who will dig deep into user‑support data—surfacing trends, volumes, and friction signals—and turn these findings into actionable insights and always‑on reporting. You’ll design, build, and maintain self‑serve dashboards that keep every stakeholder informed in real time, partnering closely with Data Science and Engineering to ensure clean pipelines, robust models, and scalable tooling. Think proactive friction detection and real‑time service‑health views that help us stay ahead of demand—delivering decision‑grade insights, not just prettier slide decks.

This role is based in San Francisco, California. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In This Role, You Will


Explore large support and product datasets to uncover trends, volume drivers, and user‑experience pain points, distilling findings into clear, actionable narratives.
Build, enhance, and maintain self‑serve dashboards and reporting tools, enabling non‑technical teams to answer their own data questions.
Establish a unified metrics taxonomy for service‑health and performance—and build automated data‑sharing pipelines and scorecards with our BPO partners to ensure everyone operates from the same real‑time view of success
Leverage LLMs to build bespoke classifiers that automatically label and segment inbound volumes—powering smarter routing, richer self‑serve insights, and swifter root‑cause analysis.
Partner with Data Engineering to ensure reliable pipelines, implement data‑quality checks, and document sources of truth.
Jump into high‑priority special projects to conduct bespoke deep‑dive analyses and deliver clear, strategic recommendations to leadership.
Prototype quickly—leveraging ChatGPT, Jupyter notebooks, Retool, and other tools—to prove value before hardening with Engineering.
Collaborate with Data Science on predictive models and experimentation, translating results into operational recommendations.


You Might Thrive In This Role If You


8 + years in analytics, business intelligence, or data science, ideally supporting customer support or operations teams.
Expert‑level SQL skills and proficiency in Python or R for advanced analysis and automation
Hands‑on experience designing and maintaining BI dashboards (e.g. Looker, Mode, Tableau, Sundial) with a focus on clarity and self‑serve usability.
Hands‑on experience fine‑tuning or prompt‑engineering LLMs to build text classifiers, sentiment analysis, or tagging systems.
Demonstrated ability to translate complex datasets into clear business stories and recommendations for both technical and non‑technical audiences.
Familiarity with support metrics (SLAs, FCR, deflection) and ability to define service health KPIs.
Strong cross‑functional communication skills—comfortable collaborating daily with engineers, data scientists, and operations leaders.
An eye for detail, a zero‑defect mindset, and a bias toward action over theoretical perfection
Possess a strong bias for automation and can defend governance decisions that keep data and processes healthy as they grow.
Thrive in a fast‑moving, ambiguous environment where priorities can shift quickly.

We Build The Most Complete And Accurate Picture Of The B2B Buyer By Integrating With Every Tool Your Team Uses, Partnering With Third-party Data Providers, And Deploying Custom AI Research Agents. We Use This Data To Power Applications That Automate High-value, High-complexity Workflows Across The Go-to-market And Revenue Teams. Our Core Products Include


Marketing Intelligence – instantly answers questions like “What led to that sudden drop in pipeline?”
Account Intelligence – surfaces next-best actions to help reps move target accounts toward conversion


Since launching in January 2023, we’ve come through Y Combinator, raised a $20M Series A led by Bessemer. We’re growing 3× year-over-year, have hit multimillion ARR, and process over 60 TB of GTM data monthly. Based at our San Francisco HQ, we operate fully in-person, move fast and hire people who are ready to win.

🚀 Your Mission

We are seeking a customer-focused Data Analyst to help our clients answer their most important business questions around GTM revenue performance and marketing spend optimization. This is not a heavy data-engineering role; instead, you’ll use HockeyStack’s platform and available data to guide customers toward impactful insights and recommendations.

🔧 What You’ll Do


Partner with customers to solve their revenue goals, challenges, and questions. Use HockeyStack’s platform to uncover insights and deliver clear, actionable recommendations.
Translate complex metrics into straightforward explanations for non-technical audiences.
Be the Data Partner to support Customer Success Managers in delivering strategic guidance to clients.
Identify patterns and trends in marketing and sales data to advise customers on where to focus efforts.
Collaborate with internal teams to continuously enhance the customer experience.


🧩 Core Strengths


Business Insight: Ability to connect data to revenue outcomes and business strategy.
Customer Orientation: Skilled at understanding client goals and delivering value through insights.
Analytical Thinking: Comfortable framing and answering complex questions with data-driven logic.
Clear Communication: Able to translate analytics into simple, impactful recommendations.


🧬 What We’re Looking For


Ownership-first mindset — you take initiative, move fast, and figure things out
Thrive in early-stage, high-urgency environments where speed and impact matter
Curious, self-aware, and feedback-driven — you bring energy, not ego
See this role as a defining chapter — not a stepping stone or side quest
Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Data Science, Applied Economics, or a related field.
1–3 years of experience in Data Analytics or Consulting with Analytical focus. Strong preference for candidates with Marketing Analytics or GTM/Sales Analytics Experience.
Strong problem-solving skills with the ability to structure and answer key business questions.
Excellent communication skills to convey data-driven insights to senior stakeholders.
Familiarity with SaaS, B2B marketing, or revenue analytics is a strong plus.
Ability to think strategically and recommend actions based on data, without needing to deep-dive into raw datasets.


✨ Why Join Now?

We’re at an inflection point. The product is proven, the market is massive, and the opportunity is wide open. You’ll be joining a company with real traction, rapid growth, and meaningful backing—where every person still shapes the outcome. This isn’t just a job. It’s a chance to build something category-defining with people who care deeply about doing it right.

We’re building a high-performing, in-person culture at our San Francisco HQ, where the team collaborates shoulder-to-shoulder five days a week. While that's our standard for most roles, this position is uniquely flexible—offering remote options for exceptional candidates based in the U.S. or internationally, as long as you're fully available during U.S. business hours. The base salary range for this role is $40,000 to $120,000 USD, adjusted for location, experience, and qualifications.

HockeyStack is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, protected veteran status, disability, or any other legally protected status. We celebrate diversity and are committed to fostering an inclusive environment for all employees.

Figma’s platform helps teams bring ideas to life—whether you're brainstorming, creating a prototype, translating designs into code, or iterating with AI. From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world. If you're excited to shape the future of design and collaboration, join us!

We’re looking for a People Data Analyst to build thoughtful, scalable data tools that empower our People team with the insights they need to support every stage of the employee experience. You’ll take ownership of our people data tools to deliver automated reporting and intuitive dashboards that enable better decisions throughout the employee lifecycle. This is a builder role, ideal for someone who thrives on technical challenges, turning complex data into empowering tools, and digging beneath the surface to solve the real problem (not just deliver what's asked).

If you’re excited about building for scale and working alongside an amazing people team during a time of growing maturity, this role could be for you! We’ve spent the past few years implementing new systems and processes - now comes the fun part of bringing the data together to tell stories across the recruiting and employee lifecycles!

This is a full time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.

What you’ll do at Figma:


Develop and maintain dashboards and analytics tools across the employee lifecycle that equip the People team and business leaders with timely, actionable insights.
Use SQL to extract, clean, and organize data from multiple People systems—ensuring it is structured, accurate, and ready to power reporting, dashboards, and analytics products across the employee lifecycle.
Design, manage, and evolve a centralized metrics library that defines and standardizes key people metrics across the employee lifecycle, supporting consistent reporting and analysis.
Own and maintain the self-service reporting experience in platforms like OneModel and Tableau—ensuring stakeholders can access trusted, timely data across the employee lifecycle.
Create clear documentation, training, and enablement resources to support non-technical users in confidently navigating dashboards and making data-informed decisions.
Establish feedback loops with end users to continuously improve dashboard usability, identify reporting gaps, and ensure data products evolve with stakeholder needs.


We'd love to hear from you if you have:


Approximately 5 years of experience in HR or Recruiting, people analytics, or a related field, with exposure to People or Talent data.
Demonstrated experience with basic SQL and can independently write clean, efficient queries to manipulate fields and join data across systems
Familiarity with HR systems like Workday, Greenhouse, Gem, CultureAmp, or similar tools, and a willingness to deepen your understanding over time.
Experience working with a BI tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI), or a people analytics reporting tool (e.g., OneModel, Visier).
A builder’s mindset—you’re excited by the challenge of designing scalable solutions that reduce manual work and increase self-service.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $167,300 - $251,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We leverage both internal and external subject matter experts to support our assessments and address any concerns that arise.
When we identify gaps between contractual obligations and vendor performance&mdash;particularly in non-Information Security areas&mdash;we document these as findings.
These findings require remediation by the vendor and must be communicated effectively to business owners, Procurement, and the vendors themselves.
As such, analysts must be adept at tailoring communications for diverse audiences.
Our team collaborates closely with Information Security, other Enterprise Risk and Compliance (ERC) teams, Procurement, Legal, and business stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive and aligned approach to third-party risk management.
This initiative is designed to support the Third-Party Risk Management team by conducting comprehensive risk assessments of both new and existing Goods Not For Resale (GNFR) vendors.
The primary objective is to evaluate vendor risk profiles and ensure alignment with our organizational standards and policies.

2 years of experience performing risk assessments or audits
Minimum 2+ years of experience in the TPRM risk category Information Security
Familiarity with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF), and ISO 27000 series
Strong interpersonal and communication skills with the ability to develop productive working relationships with technical and non-technical teams
Ability to work in a fast-paced environment within a team
 
Desired Skills:
CISSP, Security+, Network+, or SSCP certification
Experience in the TPRM risk categories Business Resiliency, Finance, Ethics/Compliance, or Insurance.
Experience with Archer GRC tool.
Ability to work with a start-up mentality inside of a large organization to provide security recommendations with the business strategy and goals in mind.

About The Job

Google's leadership team hand-picks thorny business challenges, and members of BizOps work in small teams to find solutions. As part of this team you fully immerse yourself in data collection, draw insight from analysis, and then zoom out to develop compelling, synthesized recommendations. Taking strategy one step further, you also persuasively communicate your recommendations to senior-level executives, roll-up your sleeves to help drive implementation and check back-in to see the impact of your recommendations.

As an Associate Data Analyst, you will be part of the Sellside Global Operations team, which supports the world’s leading publishers and helps drive accelerated business growth for them through our publisher result and platform solutions. The Global Partnership Sales Engine (GPSE) team is an integral part of creating efficiency and scale in support of our publisher result and platform solutions. The GPSE team is designed to accelerate operational activities and centralize work (e.g., operational activities like reporting, implementation, and optimization) away from sales teams so that front-line business leaders can concentrate their efforts on client-specific activities and continue growing a global business.

In this role, you will have the opportunity to work with an extensive range of cross-functional teams on the Global Partnerships side of the business, to further evolve and scale GPSE support. You will use your stakeholder management (ensure customer and stakeholder expectations are understood, met, and managed), data analysis, communication, and lead projects/case work independently.

Responsibilities


Provide data and analytical support to frontline account management teams and sales leaders, enabling the identification and pitching of generating opportunities.
Support the development of scaled reporting and optimization services and dashboards, unlocking operational efficiencies for our sales teams.
Streamline operations leveraging automation and process improvement best practices, leveraging SQL and data visualisation skills (Google Sheets and Looker Studio).
Gather and analyze feedback from users and internal team to improve existing services and workflows.

Want to make an impact? Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.




We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.




Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, we work closely with our teams in Barcelona, San Antonio, Spokane, and remote locations. We’ve got a reputation for being a great place to work, having been named among the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Seattle Business Magazine and Washington’s Best Workplaces in the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies.




At Rover, our furry coworkers are just as important as our human ones—and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Along with making the joys of pet parenthood more accessible, we’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community of pet people—and that starts with our employees.




Who we're looking for:

The Marketing Analytics team supports the company’s marketing efforts, while also working with teams throughout the organization. The analytics team is responsible for a number of business-critical reports and data models that our global marketing teams rely on for daily reporting, budgeting, and analysis. We measure marketing attribution to understand how people become Rover customers, provide campaign reporting to monitor trends in cost efficiency and optimization, deliver lifecycle data to action against a variety of customer behaviors, and narrate the business to identify and prioritize new opportunities.




We are looking for an Analyst to support our Growth, International Expansion, Lifecycle, and SEO stakeholders with a focus on improving our reporting and dashboard structure. The ideal candidate will have experience working closely with business stakeholders and building data-driven narratives that enable clear decision making.




*This is a hybrid position that has the minimum expectation to work out of our Barcelona Office in the Poblenou neighborhood two days per week on Mondays and Thursdays. For this reason, candidates must be based in Barcelona or willing to relocate.




Your Responsibilities:

Work closely with analytics peers and marketing teams to narrate trends and insights, with a particular focus on our customer acquisition marketing programs.
Design reports and dashboards that enable clear, data-driven decision-making for marketing and cross-functional teams.
Refine our marketing attribution models to drive optimal resource allocation across paid and organic marketing channels.
Expand your expertise by supporting experiments such as A/B testing and Market Match tests to optimize strategies across multiple marketing functions.




Your Qualifications:

At least 2 years experience working with complex datasets to support business decision making.
Fluency in SQL.
Data visualisation tool experience (e.g. Mode, Looker, Tableau, etc.)
Ability to adapt your communication style to translate complex data insights for different audiences.
You have experience in owning small-to-medium projects from design to completion with limited guidance from your manager.
You understand when you are blocked, proactively seeking out for help within the team or the organization to move the project forward.




Nice to Have:

Python or R familiarity is helpful, but we welcome candidates eager to develop these skills.
Experience evaluating results of A/B tests as well as expertise in statistical analysis.
Understanding of marketing metrics such as clicks, CPC, CTR, impressions, and unit economics like customer LTV, payback period, and CAC.




Benefits of working at Rover:

Competitive compensation
Long-term incentive plan with a company performance-based cash payout
Permanent contract
Pension plan
Meal tickets through Cobee
Generous PTO allowance
Private health insurance
Discounted gym membership
Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time)
Monetary help for adopting a dog or cat plus yearly credit to use on our platform
A wide variety of snacks, fresh fruit, and beverages in our kitchen to keep yourself going
Regular team activities, including happy hours, game nights, and more

Mars Capital has the capacity and regulatory authority to service loans secured against properties and has €8bn AUM, experiencing significant growth in recent years. We provide services that span the full lifecycle of a loan post origination, from drawdown through to loan administration, asset management, enforcement as well as syndication, securitisation, and standby servicing.

We value our relationship with our clients and believe that our deployment of dedicated, Dublin-based project and asset management teams give us a competitive advantage over other competitors who operate a shared services model across their portfolios. Placing the customer first in a simple and efficient manner in line with our regulatory obligation is our number one priority.

Our local strategic ambition is to provide value accretive services to institutional clients, while building better financial futures for our customers, clients, communities and colleagues.

Our Culture and Way of Working

We’re entrepreneurial, fast-paced and decisive, working together safely and supportively. We trust our colleagues to make the right decisions and are brave enough to acknowledge mistakes and to learn from them. Celebrating success, we reward those who help us to achieve exceptional long-term results.

We’re inclusive and encourage our colleagues to be themselves. Our culture supports the difference that makes each of us unique. We’re open and eager to embrace new ways of working and have a diverse community, enriched by our local identities that works collaboratively to build a unified and dynamic organisation.

We believe that a supported flexible working approach helps us to retain valued colleagues, enhance wellbeing, increase motivation and encourage a healthy work/life balance. If you’re interviewed, ask about the flexibility involved in this role.

Our Values

Our stakeholders expect us to act in an ethical and responsible way and this is at the heart of how we conduct our business.

Our STAR Awards provide a fantastic platform to send a special thank you to a colleague who may have gone above and beyond to help you and the business succeed, or someone who has been brave and creative with their own approach to how they work. Values orientated, our Recognition Scheme plays a pivotal role in aligning and celebrating our culture, and simply wouldn’t exist without colleague participation and input.

The Data Analyst will play a central role in supporting the effective administration and oversight of confidential data. The primary responsibility is to coordinate market placement declarations, ensure accurate and timely data reporting by producers/distributors, monitor the integrity of submissions, and enhance business intelligence (BI) capabilities throughout the organisation. The successful candidate will be instrumental in mitigating non-compliance risks, detecting under-reporting, and driving initiatives to automate compliance and reporting processes.




Responsibilities:




Market Placement Declaration Coordination: Oversee the end-to-end process of platform availability and user access for market placement data entry, ensuring all designated parties (producers/importers) have access, promptly addressing technical or process-related issues, dispatching reminders, and actively following up on late, missing, or inconsistent submissions.




Market Surveillance & Data Verification: Design, implement, and execute comprehensive market surveillance protocols, including data auditing, reconciliation, and cross-verification of reported declarations to detect anomalies, under-declarations, and inconsistencies.




Fraud Detection & Analytical Modelling: Develop, refine, and maintain data-driven tools and machine learning models for fraud detection, anomaly spotting, and pattern recognition within large datasets to identify irregularities indicative of non-compliance or fraudulent activities.




Reporting, Business Intelligence & Automation: Lead the preparation of analytical reports, compliance dashboards, and ad hoc analyses for internal and regulatory purposes. Automate recurring reporting and data processing tasks via coding and advanced BI tools to drive process efficiency and accuracy.




Stakeholder Communication & Collaboration: Serve as a point of contact with the regulatory authority, ensuring timely and accurate exchange of relevant compliance data. Liaise with internal teams (including operations, IT, compliance, and management) to support investigation of irregularities, resolve issues, and communicate analytical findings.




Requirements:




Demonstrated proficiency in business intelligence tools (e.g., Power BI, DAX) for building interactive dashboards, data models, and management reports.
Applied experience in machine learning techniques and data analytics for the purposes of fraud detection, anomaly detection, or compliance monitoring.
Proficiency in programming/scripting languages for process automation and data manipulation.
Advanced knowledge of Microsoft Office suite, especially for data analysis and presentation.
Prior experience in a customer-facing or stakeholder management function, with strong communication skills and a proactive attitude.
Educational background in a relevant field such as Data Science, Business Analytics, Statistics, Economics, or Computer Science.




Desirable:




Experience in compliance monitoring, audit, or fraud detection in market placement, environmental schemes, or similar data-centric regulatory environments.
Previous exposure to regulatory data submissions, market surveillance, compliance assurance, or related regulatory programmes.
Familiarity with the operational aspects of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) frameworks.




Personal Attributes:




Analytical mindset with acute attention to detail.
Proactive problem-solver able to work creatively and independently and as part of a cross-functional team.
Strong organisational skills; able to balance multiple priorities and deadlines.
High ethical standards and commitment to data integrity, compliance, and non disclosure.

As the role is our entry level, this is a great entry point for a career path at Lokad, either as a future technical expert or as manager.




We help companies in different verticals (aerospace, automotive, ecommerce…) to forecast and make decisions about their inventory. The vast majority of our clients are based outside of France, mainly in North America and Europe.




As a Business Data Analyst (or Supply Chain Scientist in Lokad's terminology), your role is to make sure our clients get the most from Lokad's technology. The role is a mix between technology, data crunching and supply chain expertise. You will address complex supply chain issues and craft quantitative strategies. Your goal is not only to advise your clients on strategies to adopt, but to craft and execute these strategies on a daily basis while leveraging the data available as much as possible. Your goal is also to keep refining these strategies over time to keep them aligned with the needs of our clients.




At Lokad, you will benefit from the extensive training and coaching of our expert team. You will gain skills in supply chain, predictive analysis and overall quantitative optimization for business. You will learn how to achieve measurable business results grounded on scientific analysis of data.




About one quarter of your time is spent interacting with clients in order to better understand their business (mainly over the phone or by mail, with occasional travels). Note that, in order to benefit from your colleagues expertise, you won't be required to work on the customers' premises.




The rest of your time is spent on data analysis, including manipulating and cleaning data, setting up forecasts, economic optimization, reporting and data vizualisation. In order to do this, you'll learn to use our Differentiable Programming tools and a DSL (Envision) developped by Lokad.




We are looking for candidates with the following skills and qualities:




A strong engineering background.
A keen interest in data and quantitative analysis in general.
Good Excel skills or programming skills (e.g. Python, VBA, SQL, etc.).
Impeccable command of English ( French is optional).
Excellent communication skills and telephone manners.
A well-made head, rather than a well-filled head. We are not looking for someone who is already an expert in supply chain or programming. We’re looking for a fast learner, with an ability to quickly grasp technology and concepts, since our technology is by no means a simple and plug-and-play product. Knowledge or understanding of supply chain would be a bonus, but the ability to quickly assess and grasp a new situation or get a clear picture of how an organization works and what are the pain points is what we are really after.
Candidates must be self-motivated, confident and highly driven to achieve results with a “hands on” attitude.




The role is predominantly office based, although some travel will be occasionally required to customers, partners or events. We are located in the very center of Paris, France (station Chevaleret).

Are you passionate about improving our environment for this generation and those to follow? Are you ready to take on new challenges and collaborate with a future-focused team leading the way into new markets? Join Nexamp! 

This is where you can learn from industry leaders and become one yourself. It's fast-paced, mission-based work that challenges the status quo. Be on the team that's changing the world. 

What we’re looking for: 

We're looking for a Lead Data Analyst to craft insightful and compelling data stories, empower business owners across Nexamp to make more effective data-driven decisions, and help build our self-service data platform. As one of the nation’s largest and longest tenured solar and storage owner operators – and one of the few that is fully vertically integrated – our data is a differentiator in the market and a catalyst for future growth. You’ll be solving uniquely challenging data problems, alongside a strong team, and for a company in which the business model and mission are inseparably intertwined: our solar farms save customers money, help the planet, and are profitable for Nexamp and its investors. 

This role will be hybrid, based out of our Boston office, and you will report to the Director of Product, Data.

What you’ll do:  

Own and Deliver Data Products: Independently gather requirements for, prioritize, deliver, maintain, and continuously improve reusable data models, dashboards, analyses, A/B tests, and other data assets. Act as the product manager and implementer for your domain’s data offerings. Implement work using advanced SQL and BI tool skills. 
Be a Trusted Data Partner: Become the subject matter expert for data in your business areas. Identify opportunities for impact, proactively surface insights, support decision-making, and contribute to and influence business strategy and initiatives. Serve as your business stakeholders’ right hand. Support other business areas opportunistically.
Drive Data Quality, Documentation, and Engineering: Create and maintain comprehensive data documentation and communicate updates to your stakeholders. Write user stories or tickets for data engineering, validate data mapping, conduct QA, and implement data quality monitoring.
Foster Data Culture and Adoption: Monitor the usage of data assets, increase data literacy, and promote self-service through BI tools among stakeholders. Provide training, guidance, and support as needed.  
Collaborate Across the Data Team: Work within a centralized data team using agile methodologies. Collaborate with peer analysts through overlapping work, priority shifting, and code reviews to broaden your Nexamp knowledge.
Influence Data Strategy: Partner with the data architect, engineers, scientists, and analysts to shape the vision and roadmap for Nexamp’s data platform. Define and track annual OKRs to measure your impact.  

What you’ll bring: 

5-7 years of experience as a data analyst serving business owners and collaborating with data engineers (experience in the energy/construction industry is a plus, but not required) 
Advanced in SQL and BI tool administration and usage (experience with Databricks and Sigma are a plus, but not required) 
Strong track record of independently solving problems.
Commitment to Nexamp's mission and have a passion for solving tomorrow's climate crisis today.
Demonstrated experience in effectively communicating information, ideas, and perspectives with people inside and beyond your organization.   
Experience in showcasing initiative to make improvements to current work, processes, products, and services across the organization. We value accountability and an ownership mentality. 
Ability to ask appropriate questions, analyze data, identify the root causes of problems, and present creative solutions. 
Expertise in building strong internal and external relationships with customers and stakeholders, instilling trust and loyalty across the industry. 
Eagerness to develop a fundamental understanding of how Nexamp operates and then apply that knowledge effectively to inform business decisions.  

If you don’t meet 100% of the above qualifications, but see yourself contributing, please apply.

At Nexamp, our mission is to build the future of energy so it is clean, simple, and accessible for all. We are committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, veteran status, or any other basis protected by law. By encouraging a culture where ideas and decisions come from all people, we believe it will help us grow, innovate, and be a part of environmental and social change.

You’ll love working here because:  

Not only will you get to take part in meaningful work and have the chance to change the world alongside innovative, dedicated, and motivated peers, but you will also have access to all the benefits that Nexamp offers! This includes our competitive compensation package; a 401(k) employer-match; health, dental, and vision insurance starting day one; flexible paid time off and holiday PTO; commuter benefits, and cell phone reimbursement. We have headquarters in Boston, MA and Chicago, IL, in addition to growing offices nationwide. We provide healthy snacks, coffee, service days and other volunteer opportunities, company outings, and more!  

Nexamp's People team manages all aspects of recruitment and hiring within our organization. We want to inform third-party recruiters, staffing firms, and related agencies that Nexamp does not accept unsolicited resumes. Resumes will only be considered from these entities if a signed agreement is in place and the People team explicitly authorizes external recruiting assistance for a specific position. Any unsolicited resumes received will be deemed the property of Nexamp. We want to emphasize that Nexamp is not liable for any fees associated with unsolicited resumes.

Diving into large data sets, uncovering insights, and providing impactful recommendations to clients
Connecting the dots across channels through data (including display media, site, search, email, and social) to provide a holistic view of marketing efforts
Communicating with clients regularly on scheduled deliverables and ad-hoc requests
Collaborating with internal teams and external partners to drive success for client’s business goals
