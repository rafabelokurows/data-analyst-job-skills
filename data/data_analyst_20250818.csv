Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We’re looking for platform experts who thrive on structure, strategy, and solving.

We’re looking for a Social Listening & Insights Analyst who brings more than just monitoring skills—you bring the ability to uncover meaningful insights from complex social data and connect them to the bigger picture. Working within a large matrixed tech environment, you’ll help transform how we use social listening to inform business and marketing decisions across priority customer solution areas (CSAs).

You’ll support both planned and ad hoc reporting, contributing to a stronger insights-driven culture. This role is ideal for someone who’s both analytical and curious, with the drive to not just report on trends—but to ask better questions, spot patterns, and tell stories with data that shape strategy.

Azure, Power BI, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 are just a few examples of the innovative products and services that comprise the ecosystem.

What You’ll Do

Own and deliver recurring and ad hoc social listening reports across CSAs, tailored to specific campaign, brand, or business priorities.
Translate social data into clear, actionable insights that drive decisions—beyond just volume metrics.
Provide point-in-time analysis during key launches, events, or spikes in conversation.
Surface sentiment trends, audience behaviors, competitor comparisons, and whitespace opportunities.
Partner closely with social media managers, strategists, and ops leads to align reporting with campaign and business objectives.
Act as a thought partner—not just a report generator—by proactively identifying insight opportunities and storylines.
Help evolve our reporting frameworks, storytelling formats, and listening taxonomies over time.
Stay current on industry tools, best practices, and emerging technologies in the listening and analytics space.

What You’ll Bring

3–5+ years of experience in social listening, digital analytics, or insights—ideally in agency, tech, or global brand settings.

Support, Document, and Train:


Provide support for dashboard users, troubleshoot issues, and document best practices.

As a Product Analyst, you will have the opportunity to develop, test, launch and scale member banking experience products. Through experimentation, user behavioral analysis, sophisticated statistical and data science modeling, and dashboards development, you will surface product insights and recommendations that will increase adoption, engagement, and retention of our members.

In this role, you will work closely with product managers, user research, engineers, product & lifecycle marketing, and operational stakeholders to foster a data-driven product development culture, advise our product roadmaps, and build a deep understanding of member behavior.

The base salary offered for this role and level of experience will begin at $124,600 USD and go up to $155,800 USD. Full-time employees are also eligible for a bonus, competitive equity package, and benefits. The actual base salary offered may be higher, depending on your location, skills, qualifications, and experience.

In this role, you can expect to


Keep a pulse on performance metrics and KPIs. You will be positioned to have a view of the business, product, and member base and encouraged to understand and explain trends.
Foster a data-driven, test-and-learn culture with your passion for telling stories with data - not only surfacing insights but also presenting those insights and recommendations to encourage and inspire change.
Partner widely with product, engineering, research, and design to translate your insights to guide product development. You’ll use data to help the organization understand how members are interacting with Chime and convert that to business and experience implications.
Lead experimentation by providing mentorship on how they should be run, defining success metrics and data requirements, evaluating impact, and providing strategic direction.
Advise roadmap, analysis and metric ideation, and strategic discussions with stakeholders.
Collaborate with analysts and other functions to help bridge business questions and technical (data / computational) solutions.


To thrive in this role, you have


4+ years in data-focused roles (post-internship), building analytical infrastructure and data tools that support a wide audience and facilitate decisions of trade-offs. B2C product analytics and FinTech experience preferred.
Expertise in SQL - you innately translate business questions to queries, understand the edge cases of joins, and can explore a warehouse to find data most appropriate to the problem.
Familiarity in R or python - you write reproducible code and have a tendency toward automation.
Experience leading experimentation, statistical analysis, and sophisticated measurement (e.g. causal inference) E2E to guide decision making.
Hands-on experience with BI/Visualization tools (Looker, Tableau, PowerBI, etc).
Experience building metric frameworks to understand user behaviors.
Ability to think holistically to solve business problems at hand and navigate through ambiguity.
Excellent stakeholder managements skills, with a record of working cross-functionally to achieve results.
A focus on impact - you don’t stop with just recommendations but ensure to see work through to changing the business.

The User Operations team is central to ensuring that our customers' experience with our products is nothing short of exceptional. We resolve complex issues, provide technical guidance, and support customers in maximizing value and adoption from deploying our products. We work closely with Sales, Technical Success, Product, Engineering and others to deliver the best possible experience to our customers at scale. OpenAI's customers represent a range of diverse backgrounds and maturity, from early-stage startups to established global enterprises. Given OpenAI’s breakneck shipping cadence and growth—and the expectation that it will only accelerate—transforming our rich support data into real‑time insights and scalable, self‑serve analytics is critical to sustaining exceptional customer experiences on the path to AGI.

About The Role

We’re seeking a User Operations Data Analyst who will dig deep into user‑support data—surfacing trends, volumes, and friction signals—and turn these findings into actionable insights and always‑on reporting. You’ll design, build, and maintain self‑serve dashboards that keep every stakeholder informed in real time, partnering closely with Data Science and Engineering to ensure clean pipelines, robust models, and scalable tooling. Think proactive friction detection and real‑time service‑health views that help us stay ahead of demand—delivering decision‑grade insights, not just prettier slide decks.

This role is based in San Francisco, California. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In This Role, You Will


Explore large support and product datasets to uncover trends, volume drivers, and user‑experience pain points, distilling findings into clear, actionable narratives.
Build, enhance, and maintain self‑serve dashboards and reporting tools, enabling non‑technical teams to answer their own data questions.
Establish a unified metrics taxonomy for service‑health and performance—and build automated data‑sharing pipelines and scorecards with our BPO partners to ensure everyone operates from the same real‑time view of success
Leverage LLMs to build bespoke classifiers that automatically label and segment inbound volumes—powering smarter routing, richer self‑serve insights, and swifter root‑cause analysis.
Partner with Data Engineering to ensure reliable pipelines, implement data‑quality checks, and document sources of truth.
Jump into high‑priority special projects to conduct bespoke deep‑dive analyses and deliver clear, strategic recommendations to leadership.
Prototype quickly—leveraging ChatGPT, Jupyter notebooks, Retool, and other tools—to prove value before hardening with Engineering.
Collaborate with Data Science on predictive models and experimentation, translating results into operational recommendations.


You Might Thrive In This Role If You


8 + years in analytics, business intelligence, or data science, ideally supporting customer support or operations teams.
Expert‑level SQL skills and proficiency in Python or R for advanced analysis and automation
Hands‑on experience designing and maintaining BI dashboards (e.g. Looker, Mode, Tableau, Sundial) with a focus on clarity and self‑serve usability.
Hands‑on experience fine‑tuning or prompt‑engineering LLMs to build text classifiers, sentiment analysis, or tagging systems.
Demonstrated ability to translate complex datasets into clear business stories and recommendations for both technical and non‑technical audiences.
Familiarity with support metrics (SLAs, FCR, deflection) and ability to define service health KPIs.
Strong cross‑functional communication skills—comfortable collaborating daily with engineers, data scientists, and operations leaders.
An eye for detail, a zero‑defect mindset, and a bias toward action over theoretical perfection
Possess a strong bias for automation and can defend governance decisions that keep data and processes healthy as they grow.
Thrive in a fast‑moving, ambiguous environment where priorities can shift quickly.

Figma’s platform helps teams bring ideas to life—whether you're brainstorming, creating a prototype, translating designs into code, or iterating with AI. From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world. If you're excited to shape the future of design and collaboration, join us!

We’re looking for a People Data Analyst to build thoughtful, scalable data tools that empower our People team with the insights they need to support every stage of the employee experience. You’ll take ownership of our people data tools to deliver automated reporting and intuitive dashboards that enable better decisions throughout the employee lifecycle. This is a builder role, ideal for someone who thrives on technical challenges, turning complex data into empowering tools, and digging beneath the surface to solve the real problem (not just deliver what's asked).

If you’re excited about building for scale and working alongside an amazing people team during a time of growing maturity, this role could be for you! We’ve spent the past few years implementing new systems and processes - now comes the fun part of bringing the data together to tell stories across the recruiting and employee lifecycles!

This is a full time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.

What you’ll do at Figma:


Develop and maintain dashboards and analytics tools across the employee lifecycle that equip the People team and business leaders with timely, actionable insights.
Use SQL to extract, clean, and organize data from multiple People systems—ensuring it is structured, accurate, and ready to power reporting, dashboards, and analytics products across the employee lifecycle.
Design, manage, and evolve a centralized metrics library that defines and standardizes key people metrics across the employee lifecycle, supporting consistent reporting and analysis.
Own and maintain the self-service reporting experience in platforms like OneModel and Tableau—ensuring stakeholders can access trusted, timely data across the employee lifecycle.
Create clear documentation, training, and enablement resources to support non-technical users in confidently navigating dashboards and making data-informed decisions.
Establish feedback loops with end users to continuously improve dashboard usability, identify reporting gaps, and ensure data products evolve with stakeholder needs.


We'd love to hear from you if you have:


Approximately 5 years of experience in HR or Recruiting, people analytics, or a related field, with exposure to People or Talent data.
Demonstrated experience with basic SQL and can independently write clean, efficient queries to manipulate fields and join data across systems
Familiarity with HR systems like Workday, Greenhouse, Gem, CultureAmp, or similar tools, and a willingness to deepen your understanding over time.
Experience working with a BI tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI), or a people analytics reporting tool (e.g., OneModel, Visier).
A builder’s mindset—you’re excited by the challenge of designing scalable solutions that reduce manual work and increase self-service.
A passion for clean, accurate, and reliable data, along with experience driving process improvements to enhance data quality.
Problem-first mindset with strong analytical curiosity— you go beyond surface-level requests to understand the true business need and deliver solutions that solve the right problem.
A collaborative working style, with the ability to partner across HR, Recruiting, L&D, and engineering teams to execute on a roadmap.


While not required, it’s an added plus if you also have:


Experience scaling OneModel in a high-growth environment.
Experience with report writing in Workday.

You’ll be able to combine sales and product data to do in-depth analysis and provide insights into funnel performance, define, build and monitor revenue impact metrics.


Responsibilities

About 4mativ Technologies, Inc.

4MATIV Technologies manages multi-modal mobility for school systems nationwide with technology to expand options and enhance service. We envision a future where all children have access to the learning opportunities that maximize their potential, and we are reimagining transportation to accelerate student outcomes.

We partner with schools to improve service, safety, and holistic sustainability, ensuring all students have access to the right ride. Currently, we manage transportation for over 50 school districts across cities including Houston, Indianapolis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Phoenix, simplifying operations and expanding services for families. Every school day, 4MATIV manages outsourced vendors and operates a contact center supporting more than 22,000 student trips across over 1,000 routes for schools across the country.

Our Client Services team provides tailored advisory and analysis services. 4MATIV works hand in hand with education organizations to design flexible, local solutions that meet the needs of every learner. We partner with school districts to optimize transportation systems, identify efficiencies, and design lasting solutions. We support some of the nation's largest public school districts and charter organizations as trusted mobility advisors. Our projects aim to enhance client understanding and empower them to drive meaningful system improvements. Data-driven insights are at the core of our work, using advanced analysis and tools to set us apart in the industry.

Our team is committed to:


Working shoulder-to-shoulder with our clients as a mission-aligned and trusted partner
Valuing diversity of perspectives and experiences
Care for every detail and outcome
Constant learning and improvement


Position Overview

4MATIV is a rapidly growing company with an increasingly broad portfolio of consulting clients. As our list of client districts and state education agencies grows, the need for a robust, productive, and knowledgeable team of analysts is increasingly important to our business. This key member to our growing team will have the ability to contribute greatly to the direction and operation of this team and business function.

The candidate will be able to handle a variety of analytical tasks including but not limited to: descriptive analysis of student transportation system performance and configuration, geospatial analysis and visualization of students/schools/terminals, estimation of the impact of different changes to system configuration and optimization (in terms of costs, efficiency, and emissions), and data pipelining. While our team utilizes standardized templates, reusable code, and documented analytic processes, client data is frequently incomplete; this role requires someone who is flexible, innovative, able to make smart assumptions, and capable of leveraging proxy variables in order to produce useful analysis.

Leverage GIS software to produce informative and actionable maps and geospatial insights for both client-facing and internal projects.
Communicate methodologies, assumptions, results, and the significance of analyses through clear written reports and presentations
Collaborate closely with business stakeholders to understand client needs and challenges, translating these into actionable data insights to guide decision-making and strategic initiatives
Uphold and contribute to the continuous improvement of company code documentation standards and data governance policies, ensuring data quality, privacy, and security

About 4mativ Technologies, Inc.

4MATIV Technologies manages multi-modal mobility for school systems nationwide with technology to expand options and enhance service. We envision a future where all children have access to the learning opportunities that maximize their potential, and we are reimagining transportation to accelerate student outcomes.

We partner with schools to improve service, safety, and holistic sustainability, ensuring all students have access to the right ride.

Every school day, 4MATIV manages outsourced vendors and operates a contact center supporting more than 22,000 student trips across over 1,000 routes for schools across the country.

Our Client Services team provides tailored advisory and analysis services. 4MATIV works hand in hand with education organizations to design flexible, local solutions that meet the needs of every learner. We partner with school districts to optimize transportation systems, identify efficiencies, and design lasting solutions. We support some of the nation's largest public school districts and charter organizations as trusted mobility advisors. Our projects aim to enhance client understanding and empower them to drive meaningful system improvements.

Leverage GIS software to produce informative and actionable maps and geospatial insights for both client-facing and internal projects.
Communicate methodologies, assumptions, results, and the significance of analyses through clear written reports and presentations
Collaborate closely with business stakeholders to understand client needs and challenges, translating these into actionable data insights to guide decision-making and strategic initiatives
Uphold and contribute to the continuous improvement of company code documentation standards and data governance policies, ensuring data quality, privacy, and security

About 4mativ Technologies, Inc.

4MATIV Technologies manages multi-modal mobility for school systems nationwide with technology to expand options and enhance service. We envision a future where all children have access to the learning opportunities that maximize their potential, and we are reimagining transportation to accelerate student outcomes.

We partner with schools to improve service, safety, and holistic sustainability, ensuring all students have access to the right ride. Currently, we manage transportation for over 50 school districts across cities including Houston, Indianapolis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Phoenix, simplifying operations and expanding services for families. Every school day, 4MATIV manages outsourced vendors and operates a contact center supporting more than 22,000 student trips across over 1,000 routes for schools across the country.

Our Client Services team provides tailored advisory and analysis services. 4MATIV works hand in hand with education organizations to design flexible, local solutions that meet the needs of every learner. We partner with school districts to optimize transportation systems, identify efficiencies, and design lasting solutions. We support some of the nation's largest public school districts and charter organizations as trusted mobility advisors. Our projects aim to enhance client understanding and empower them to drive meaningful system improvements. Data-driven insights are at the core of our work, using advanced analysis and tools to set us apart in the industry.

Constant learning and improvement


Position Overview

4MATIV is a rapidly growing company with an increasingly broad portfolio of consulting clients. As our list of client districts and state education agencies grows, the need for a robust, productive, and knowledgeable team of analysts is increasingly important to our business.

Bachelor's degree or equivalent practical experience.
Experience in an Account Management, Analyst, Ad Operations, or Project Management role or internship.
Experience working with data such as extracting, manipulating, and visualizing data from datasets.


Preferred qualifications:


Experience using one business generation or ad-serving solutions (e.g., Google Ad Manager, AdSense, AdMob, other solutions).
Experience with the streamlining operational process (i.e. automation).
Understanding of the online advertising (i.e., ad serving, business generation solutions) and of key platforms and trends (i.e., desktop, mobile, video).

About The Job

Google's leadership team hand-picks thorny business challenges, and members of BizOps work in small teams to find solutions. As part of this team you fully immerse yourself in data collection, draw insight from analysis, and then zoom out to develop compelling, synthesized recommendations. Taking strategy one step further, you also persuasively communicate your recommendations to senior-level executives, roll-up your sleeves to help drive implementation and check back-in to see the impact of your recommendations.

As an Associate Data Analyst, you will be part of the Sellside Global Operations team, which supports the world’s leading publishers and helps drive accelerated business growth for them through our publisher result and platform solutions. The Global Partnership Sales Engine (GPSE) team is an integral part of creating efficiency and scale in support of our publisher result and platform solutions. The GPSE team is designed to accelerate operational activities and centralize work (e.g., operational activities like reporting, implementation, and optimization) away from sales teams so that front-line business leaders can concentrate their efforts on client-specific activities and continue growing a global business.

In this role, you will have the opportunity to work with an extensive range of cross-functional teams on the Global Partnerships side of the business, to further evolve and scale GPSE support. You will use your stakeholder management (ensure customer and stakeholder expectations are understood, met, and managed), data analysis, communication, and lead projects/case work independently.

Responsibilities


Provide data and analytical support to frontline account management teams and sales leaders, enabling the identification and pitching of generating opportunities.
Support the development of scaled reporting and optimization services and dashboards, unlocking operational efficiencies for our sales teams.
Streamline operations leveraging automation and process improvement best practices, leveraging SQL and data visualisation skills (Google Sheets and Looker Studio).
Gather and analyze feedback from users and internal team to improve existing services and workflows.

Identification and analysis of loans in scope for systemic remediation activities.
Timely and accurate production of regular reporting and business control management..

About 4mativ Technologies, Inc.

4MATIV Technologies manages multi-modal mobility for school systems nationwide with technology to expand options and enhance service. We envision a future where all children have access to the learning opportunities that maximize their potential, and we are reimagining transportation to accelerate student outcomes.

We partner with schools to improve service, safety, and holistic sustainability, ensuring all students have access to the right ride. Currently, we manage transportation for over 50 school districts across cities including Houston, Indianapolis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Phoenix, simplifying operations and expanding services for families. Every school day, 4MATIV manages outsourced vendors and operates a contact center supporting more than 22,000 student trips across over 1,000 routes for schools across the country.

Our Client Services team provides tailored advisory and analysis services. 4MATIV works hand in hand with education organizations to design flexible, local solutions that meet the needs of every learner. We partner with school districts to optimize transportation systems, identify efficiencies, and design lasting solutions. We support some of the nation's largest public school districts and charter organizations as trusted mobility advisors. Our projects aim to enhance client understanding and empower them to drive meaningful system improvements. Data-driven insights are at the core of our work, using advanced analysis and tools to set us apart in the industry.

Our team is committed to:


Working shoulder-to-shoulder with our clients as a mission-aligned and trusted partner
Valuing diversity of perspectives and experiences
Care for every detail and outcome
Constant learning and improvement


Position Overview

4MATIV is a rapidly growing company with an increasingly broad portfolio of consulting clients. As our list of client districts and state education agencies grows, the need for a robust, productive, and knowledgeable team of analysts is increasingly important to our business. This key member to our growing team will have the ability to contribute greatly to the direction and operation of this team and business function.

Leverage GIS software to produce informative and actionable maps and geospatial insights for both client-facing and internal projects.
Communicate methodologies, assumptions, results, and the significance of analyses through clear written reports and presentations
Collaborate closely with business stakeholders to understand client needs and challenges, translating these into actionable data insights to guide decision-making and strategic initiatives

Are you passionate about improving our environment for this generation and those to follow? Are you ready to take on new challenges and collaborate with a future-focused team leading the way into new markets? Join Nexamp! 

This is where you can learn from industry leaders and become one yourself. It's fast-paced, mission-based work that challenges the status quo. Be on the team that's changing the world. 

What we’re looking for: 

We're looking for a Lead Data Analyst to craft insightful and compelling data stories, empower business owners across Nexamp to make more effective data-driven decisions, and help build our self-service data platform. As one of the nation’s largest and longest tenured solar and storage owner operators – and one of the few that is fully vertically integrated – our data is a differentiator in the market and a catalyst for future growth. You’ll be solving uniquely challenging data problems, alongside a strong team, and for a company in which the business model and mission are inseparably intertwined: our solar farms save customers money, help the planet, and are profitable for Nexamp and its investors. 

This role will be hybrid, based out of our Boston office, and you will report to the Director of Product, Data.

What you’ll do:  

Own and Deliver Data Products: Independently gather requirements for, prioritize, deliver, maintain, and continuously improve reusable data models, dashboards, analyses, A/B tests, and other data assets. Act as the product manager and implementer for your domain’s data offerings. Implement work using advanced SQL and BI tool skills. 
Be a Trusted Data Partner: Become the subject matter expert for data in your business areas. Identify opportunities for impact, proactively surface insights, support decision-making, and contribute to and influence business strategy and initiatives. Serve as your business stakeholders’ right hand. Support other business areas opportunistically.
Drive Data Quality, Documentation, and Engineering: Create and maintain comprehensive data documentation and communicate updates to your stakeholders. Write user stories or tickets for data engineering, validate data mapping, conduct QA, and implement data quality monitoring.
Foster Data Culture and Adoption: Monitor the usage of data assets, increase data literacy, and promote self-service through BI tools among stakeholders. Provide training, guidance, and support as needed.  
Collaborate Across the Data Team: Work within a centralized data team using agile methodologies. Collaborate with peer analysts through overlapping work, priority shifting, and code reviews to broaden your Nexamp knowledge.
Influence Data Strategy: Partner with the data architect, engineers, scientists, and analysts to shape the vision and roadmap for Nexamp’s data platform. Define and track annual OKRs to measure your impact.  

What you’ll bring: 

5-7 years of experience as a data analyst serving business owners and collaborating with data engineers (experience in the energy/construction industry is a plus, but not required) 
Advanced in SQL and BI tool administration and usage (experience with Databricks and Sigma are a plus, but not required) 
Strong track record of independently solving problems.
Commitment to Nexamp's mission and have a passion for solving tomorrow's climate crisis today.
Demonstrated experience in effectively communicating information, ideas, and perspectives with people inside and beyond your organization.   
Experience in showcasing initiative to make improvements to current work, processes, products, and services across the organization. We value accountability and an ownership mentality. 
Ability to ask appropriate questions, analyze data, identify the root causes of problems, and present creative solutions. 
Expertise in building strong internal and external relationships with customers and stakeholders, instilling trust and loyalty across the industry. 
Eagerness to develop a fundamental understanding of how Nexamp operates and then apply that knowledge effectively to inform business decisions.  

If you don’t meet 100% of the above qualifications, but see yourself contributing, please apply.

At Nexamp, our mission is to build the future of energy so it is clean, simple, and accessible for all. We are committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, veteran status, or any other basis protected by law. By encouraging a culture where ideas and decisions come from all people, we believe it will help us grow, innovate, and be a part of environmental and social change.

You’ll love working here because:  

Not only will you get to take part in meaningful work and have the chance to change the world alongside innovative, dedicated, and motivated peers, but you will also have access to all the benefits that Nexamp offers! This includes our competitive compensation package; a 401(k) employer-match; health, dental, and vision insurance starting day one; flexible paid time off and holiday PTO; commuter benefits, and cell phone reimbursement. We have headquarters in Boston, MA and Chicago, IL, in addition to growing offices nationwide. We provide healthy snacks, coffee, service days and other volunteer opportunities, company outings, and more!  

Nexamp's People team manages all aspects of recruitment and hiring within our organization. We want to inform third-party recruiters, staffing firms, and related agencies that Nexamp does not accept unsolicited resumes. Resumes will only be considered from these entities if a signed agreement is in place and the People team explicitly authorizes external recruiting assistance for a specific position.

I believe the CRM is Dynamics on the Sales Side and Smart Sheets on the Client Side.   This is focused on the client side.   

This person will need to understand what we need to do to collect the client related data from a client management perspective.    Client lifecycle Management

Once a client signs the contract and get onboarded, how do we get their portfolios set up, client reporting, what are the reference data and other data that needs to be there.
How do we need to sunset a client?
What needs to go into different systems?
They need to work autonomously and have an opinion

Providing a high-level description of what the role would be, but please keep in mind that this person will continue beyond CRM to be the primary support analyst for the client workstream that will include client master and client reporting. We need a senior resource who can run fairly independently.
