About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

Building on 10 years of experience in the US, Flatiron’s international team is scaling Flatiron’s approach in new countries. Streamlined teams in each market are establishing partnerships with local cancer providers, and developing high-quality real-world data for researchers around the world.

Immerse yourself in business and technical context to help your team identify opportunities for optimizing our processes and unlocking new value from our unique datasets.



Who You Are

You're a kind, collaborative and analytic problem solver and value the opportunity to think beyond the way things are. In addition,



You have 3+ years of industry experience in relevant roles or have completed a PhD in a relevant field.
You’re impact-oriented, and care deeply about creating real change for customers, users, and ultimately patients. You choose the right, rather than the flashiest, method available to reach your goals.
You have a strong background in analytics and can fit the appropriate analysis approach to complex business or research problems.
You are a clear and confident communicator who can explain technical concepts to business and clinical partners.
You are versatile and can easily pick up new programming languages and tools, but come with strong experience in Python.
You have a record of success driving initiatives forward by generating buy-in, managing complexity, and continuously delivering business impact.
You are proficient in English.



Optional



You have experience working with healthcare-related data.

kontext21 is building the infrastructure for contextual intelligence. Our SDK lets developers access what users see and do — enabling deeply personalized, AI-powered software. Now we’re building our own apps on top of it to show what’s possible.




Our bold vision is backed by some great Investors: Antler, VR Ventures and Angels.


Tasks



Work directly with the founders on validating our first product for Excel power users


Build and test AI-powered features that supercharge Excel — turning spreadsheets into intelligent assistants


Become the “voice of the spreadsheet user” in product and design conversations


Research real-world use cases and help shape product features from the ground up


Be part of early outreach: talk to users, design experiments, analyze workflows


Launch your own side-project or automation, codenamed “Excel”, powered by our SDK — a “startup within”


Bonus: use your Excel skills to hack internal ops, tracking, and dashboards



Requirements



You have used Excel for 20+ hours per week — professionally or obsessively


You can build and debug complex formulas or have built complex financial models or other analytical models before


Bonus: experience with Power Query, VBA, or Google Sheets scripting


Passion for tech startups and excitement to be at the earliest stage


Sharp analytical thinking and a relentless drive to make things better


You love to ship, test, learn, and iterate — not sit on ideas





Why you shouldn't join:





You are not comfortable working without a clear structure.


You have >3 years of experience and look for that to be reflected in the pay. Our budget can not support that.


You are not ready for a career opportunity with risks. Despite our growth, we are still an early-stage startup. If you need something more predictable, this is not the right fit.



Benefits



Flexible working hours


Sport membership


Learn from us. Check out our profiles, we are experienced founders and happy to teach.





Come as you are, let's build together.

As a Senior Data Analyst in the Size & Fit team, you will play a key role in addressing the challenge of finding the right fit in online shopping. Our mission involves gaining a deep understanding of customers’ preferences related to size and fit, as well as a comprehensive knowledge of the assortment attributes and measurements from our brands.

Be a reliable partner for the Size & Fit Team when related to commercial reporting and analytics, and support the Team with more complex analysis.

Bombastisch & bezaubernd: das IT-Team, das gemeinsam mit dir spannende Missionen antreten möchte
Abwechslungsreich & vielversprechend: die Zukunft der Dussmann Group, die wir mit dir gestalten werden
Vertrauensvoll & flexibel: deine Arbeitszeiten
Sehenswert & reizvoll: dein Desksharing-Arbeitsplatz in der Friedrichstraße sowie inklusive 25% Rabatt auf alle deine Einkäufe im Dussmann KulturKaufhaus
Sicher & unbefristet: dein Arbeitsvertrag in einem krisenfesten Konzern
Langfristig & nachhaltig: deine Fort- und Weiterbildungsoptionen z.B. auf unserem Campus in Zeuthen
Grün & gesund: deine vergünstigte Mittagspause in unserem PLANET!BASED-Restaurant im Untergeschoss
Sensationell & amüsant: unsere Mitarbeiterevents wie Stammtisch, After-Work, Sommer- und Weihnachtsfeste, Teamfrühstück etc.
Attraktiv & lukrativ: deine Vergütung


Deine Mission

Du musst kein Superheld sein, um Großes zu bewirken. In der Welt der Daten reicht oft ein klarer Kopf, ein gutes Verständnis für komplexe Zusammenhänge - und ein bisschen Freude am Coden. Wenn du gerne Strukturen schaffst, wo andere nur Daten sehen, und du dich in modernen Cloud-Technologien genauso wohlfühlst wie im Austausch mit Kolleg:innen aus verschiedenen Bereichen, dann bist du bei uns genau richtig. Wir suchen jemanden, der mit technischem Know-how, Teamgeist und einem Blick fürs Wesentliche unsere Datenplattform weiterentwickelt - und dabei vielleicht sogar ein bisschen Spaß hat.


Du baust Datentransformationsstrecken, die nicht nur funktionieren, sondern auch bei Nacht deployt werden können, ohne dass du schweißgebadet aufwachst - mit Tools wie Azure Databricks, Apache Airflow oder Azure Data Factory.
Du unterstützt Führungskräfte, indem du technische Klarheit schaffst - und manchmal auch emotionale Stabilität, wenn das Deployment mal wieder zickt.
Du modellierst Daten, als wären sie Lego-Steine: strukturiert, durchdacht und mit dem gewissen „Klick“.
Du führst Deployments durch, dokumentierst gewissenhaft und sorgst dafür, dass deine Datenqualität nicht nur „okay“, sondern „wow“ ist.
Du bist Ansprechpartner:in für System Owner - also der Mensch, der komplexe Anforderungen in verständliche Lösungen übersetzt (und dabei nicht die Geduld verliert).
Du arbeitest mit dem AI Lab zusammen, wo du dafür sorgst, dass aus fancy Algorithmen auch tatsächlich funktionierende Produkte werden.
Du kooperierst mit BI Engineers, damit Dashboards nicht nur hübsch aussehen, sondern auch die Wahrheit sagen.
Du bringst dich in Projekte ein, diskutierst Datenarchitektur mit Kolleg:innen und hast dabei sogar gelegentlich Spaß.
Du arbeitest mit Fachbereichen und IT, als wärst du ein diplomatischer Datenbotschafter - mit technischem Tiefgang und einem offenen Ohr.


Deine Skills


Du hast ein Studium in (Wirtschafts-)Informatik, Statistik oder etwas ähnlich Nerdigem abgeschlossen - oder dir das Wissen auf anderem Weg draufgeschafft.
Du verstehst Datenmodellierung und Softwarearchitektur - und weißt, dass „Big Data“ nicht nur ein Buzzword ist.
Du kennst dich mit Azure aus (Data Factory, Databricks, Data Lake) - oder mit anderen Cloud-Werkzeugen, die mindestens genauso cool sind.
SQL, Python, Spark und GIT sind für dich keine Fremdwörter, sondern deine täglichen Begleiter - fast wie Kaffee.
Du arbeitest selbstständig, sorgfältig und mit einem Auge fürs Detail - auch wenn’s mal stressig wird.
Du kannst zwischen Business, IT und deinem Team vermitteln - und bleibst dabei meistens freundlich.
Dein Englisch ist verhandlungssicher - dein Humor optional, aber willkommen

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Sound like something you’d like to be a part of? We’d love to hear from you!

This position may require access to information protected under U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.

To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.


What we look for
Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.


What we offer
Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. For a candidate that we assess as possessing considerable relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.


Commitment & contract
Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time or part-time.

Location
Milan (Italy), London (UK).

The selection process
If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests designed to assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. They’re challenging and may take several hours to complete. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.

We set the bar high and won't extend an offer until we're convinced we've found the right candidate. This is why a job may stay open for months or be reposted several times.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and provide reasonable accommodations for an individual with disabilities—just let us know through this form.

Before you apply
If you’ve applied before but didn't receive an offer, we recommend waiting at least one year before applying again.

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment. We’re extremely ambitious and we hold ourselves—and one another—to a high standard. While this tends to lead to extraordinary learning, achievement, and career growth, it also requires significant commitment.

To help you ramp up quickly and set yourself up for success, we recommend spending your first few months working from our Milan office, regardless of your long-term work location. It’s the best way to rapidly absorb our company culture and build trust with your new teammates. We’ll support you with generous travel and accommodation assistance. After that, you’re welcome to work from our offices in Milan or London, or remotely from approved countries—depending on what we agree at the offer stage.

If the role speaks to you and you’re excited to give your best, we’d love to hear from you. Apply now—we can’t wait to meet you.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.

To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.


What we look for
Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.


What we offer
Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. For a candidate that we assess as possessing considerable relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.


Commitment & contract
Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time or part-time.

Location
Milan (Italy), London (UK).

The selection process
If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests designed to assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. They’re challenging and may take several hours to complete. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.

We set the bar high and won't extend an offer until we're convinced we've found the right candidate. This is why a job may stay open for months or be reposted several times.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and provide reasonable accommodations for an individual with disabilities—just let us know through this form.

Before you apply
If you’ve applied before but didn't receive an offer, we recommend waiting at least one year before applying again.

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment. We’re extremely ambitious and we hold ourselves—and one another—to a high standard. While this tends to lead to extraordinary learning, achievement, and career growth, it also requires significant commitment.

To help you ramp up quickly and set yourself up for success, we recommend spending your first few months working from our Milan office, regardless of your long-term work location. It’s the best way to rapidly absorb our company culture and build trust with your new teammates. We’ll support you with generous travel and accommodation assistance. After that, you’re welcome to work from our offices in Milan or London, or remotely from approved countries—depending on what we agree at the offer stage.

If the role speaks to you and you’re excited to give your best, we’d love to hear from you. Apply now—we can’t wait to meet you.

          At Bending Spoons, we’re striving to build one of the all-time great companies. A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.<br><br>To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.<br><br>For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.<br><br><strong>A few examples of your responsibilities</strong><ul><li>Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.</li><li>Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.</li><li>Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.</li><li>Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.</li><li>Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.<br><br></li></ul><strong>What we look for</strong><ul><li><strong>Reasoning ability.</strong> Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.</li><li><strong>Drive.</strong> You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.</li><li><strong>Team spirit.</strong> You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.</li><li><strong>Proficiency in English.</strong> You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.<br><br></li></ul><strong>What we offer</strong><ul><li><strong>Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams.</strong> You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.</li><li><strong>An exceptional opportunity for growth.</strong> We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.</li><li><strong>Competitive pay and access to equity in the company.</strong> Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. For a candidate that we assess as possessing considerable relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.</li><li><strong>All. These. Benefits.</strong> Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.<br><br></li></ul><strong>Commitment &amp; contract<br></strong>Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time or part-time.<br><br><strong>Location<br></strong>Milan (Italy), London (UK).<br><br><strong>The selection process<br></strong>If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests designed to assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. They’re challenging and may take several hours to complete. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.<br><br>We set the bar high and won't extend an offer until we're convinced we've found the right candidate. This is why a job may stay open for months or be reposted several times.<br><br>Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.<br><br>Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and provide reasonable accommodations for an individual with disabilities—just let us know through this form.<br><br><strong>Before you apply<br></strong>If you’ve applied before but didn't receive an offer, we recommend waiting at least one year before applying again.<br><br>Bending Spoons is a demanding environment. We’re extremely ambitious and we hold ourselves—and one another—to a high standard. While this tends to lead to extraordinary learning, achievement, and career growth, it also requires significant commitment.<br><br>To help you ramp up quickly and set yourself up for success, we recommend spending your first few months working from our Milan office, regardless of your long-term work location. It’s the best way to rapidly absorb our company culture and build trust with your new teammates. We’ll support you with generous travel and accommodation assistance. After that, you’re welcome to work from our offices in Milan or London, or remotely from approved countries—depending on what we agree at the offer stage.<br><br>If the role speaks to you and you’re excited to give your best, we’d love to hear from you. Apply now—we can’t wait to meet you.

The Independent is an online news publisher that was established in 1986 as a national newspaper independent of party political affiliations or proprietorial influence. In 2016, The Independent became a fully digital publisher, moving away from print in pursuit of sustainability, and to safeguard its values and journalism for the future.




The Independent has always thrived through innovation and change.

Through The Independent, Independent TV, eCommerce, indy100, subscriptions and other ‘reader revenues’, The Independent plans to continue the work of many decades, bringing much-needed independent journalism to over 100 million unique global visitors a month, make its voice ever louder and more insistent the world over.

This special place in South West London between the capital and the country has been a Royal borough longer than anywhere else - it is where the first kings of England were crowned.

Today it is a vibrant and diverse borough, with a long history and strong cultural and community heritage. Kingston's riverside location, fantastic retail offer, historic market place and church, parks and gardens all make Kingston town centre the vibrant space it is, and each of our district town centres (Surbiton, New Malden, Tolworth and Chessington) have something unique to offer.

Situated in Zone 6, Kingston is among the best-connected town centres in London – with direct train links from Kingston and Surbiton stations to Clapham Junction and London Waterloo, as well as Wimbledon for an interchange with the London Underground and Tramlink.

Kingston’s people are innovative and entrepreneurial, and have a strong sense of community pride. The borough has been home to great industry and creativity for many years, reflected in assets such as the Rose Theatre, the International Youth Arts Festival and Kingston University, which boasts more new graduate business start-ups than any other.

We have seen tremendous generosity and compassion within our communities, particularly in response to COVID-19, which is a demonstration of Kingston’s key strength. The council offers a strong level of support to vulnerable groups and those who need additional support, which has also increased significantly as a result of the pandemic. Like most places, the average age of our population is rising as more people are living longer, so we are working closely with residents to help them maintain their independence and further improve the cost effectiveness of our service to meet the ongoing rise in demand.

Kingston is home to people from diverse and interesting cultures and backgrounds, which helps to create the rich sense of community shared across the borough. In particular, Kingston has a large Sri Lankan Tamil community and is home to more people from Korea than any other part of the UK.

Job Description

We’re seeking a talented and motivated full-time Data Analyst to join our team. We’re looking for a key member of the team to own Data and Analytics to power the rest of the company and contribute to our data culture.

You will play a pivotal role in transforming data into actionable insights that drive key business decisions and product strategies. This is a cross-functional role, working closely with Sales, Revenue Operations, Support, Marketing, and other teams to translate data into meaningful narratives, and self-service tools that improve operational efficiency and drive growth.

You’ll help internal teams across the business make decisions using data and visualizations. The ability to think on one’s feet, enjoy collaborating with highly technical teams, and be comfortable working asynchronously is essential.

Advise the go-to-market team with key insights based on data to identify and support opportunities for growth
Analyze sales pipeline, conversion rates, and customer acquisition metrics to identify trends and opportunities.
Develop and automate reporting workflows to improve team efficiency.
Create and maintain documentation of data sources, metrics definitions, and analysis methodologies.
Collaborate with stakeholders to define KPIs and success metrics for GTM initiatives, including product-led growth metrics (user acquisition, activation, retention, etc.) by developing data strategies to provide these insights.
Provide regular insights and recommendations to the leadership team.


What We Are Looking For


Experience at a high growth B2B SaaS company.
Strong understanding of go to market motions, sales metrics, and marketing metrics.
Knowledge of SQL, and widely used tools like Salesforce, Snowflake, and dbt.
Proficiency in data visualization tools (Tableau, Looker, metabase, etc).
Ability to give and process constructive feedback, as well as work independently.
Ability to communicate openly, supporting and championing innovation.
Flexibility to adjust to the dynamic nature of a startup, and adept at dealing with ambiguity.


As a company, we strive to maintain fair compensation practices within our team across all roles and all levels.

Individual offers may vary based on experience and skill set.

Frequently cited statistics show that people who identify with historically marginalized groups are likely to apply to jobs only if they meet 100% of the qualifications. We encourage you to help us break that statistic!

What We Offer


An inclusive, flexible environment where you can be your authentic self. We recognize the impact of diverse voices and backgrounds on the growth of our people, product, and company. And that flexibility in how and when you work empowers our team to integrate work and life.
A competitive total compensation package. This includes a base salary, an equity incentive plan and variable commission (for quota-based roles).
Comprehensive group benefits with no waiting period. Take advantage of coverage for health, vision, dental, and more for you and your family!
Remote first company—most of our teams work fully remotely. Enjoy a change of scenery wherever you can get wifi, participate in virtual and in-person social events, and leverage our corporate co-working program to visit WeWork (or other similar spaces near you). Some roles require in-office collaboration depending on team needs, which will be clearly noted in the job description.
Connect with other Tailscalars IRL. Attend our annual company retreat, participate in team/department off-sites, or use your individual travel budget to meet up with team members in Canada, the US, or the UK.
Support for your personal and professional development. Grow your career thoughtfully with $1500 USD annually for professional development, or take advantage of mentorship, coaching, and internal promotion opportunities.
Paid time off and a healthy work-life integration. Our flexible, paid time off program supports you for any situation life throws your way, whether moving homes or travelling the world!
A build-your-own home office setup. You choose your own company-owned laptop (Mac or PC), receive a monthly home internet reimbursement, and $1000 USD to customize your workstation to make it your own.

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements



Travel:-

Being a Shopify Intern 🚀

Our hiring process is unique. We match interns to teams we think they’d be successful in and what works best for Shopify. We’re looking for:


Data Engineers to architect and manage the expansive data pipelines that fuel everything from product analytics to merchant-facing data products.
Product Data Scientists to deeply understand our products, telling their stories and figuring out how to make them 10x better.
Interns are expected to work in the office full time, with a hard minimum of being in-office 3 days/week.



Working at Shopify 💚


You must be legally entitled to work in Canada for the entire duration of the 2026 internship (January 5th to August 21st, 2026). Shopify does not provide immigration support to intern candidates at this time.
Our Data internships are 8 month long, full-time, paid experiences.
We welcome soon-to-be graduates, recent graduates, and self taught candidates with an interest in converting to full time employment after the internship term.
This is a 2026 Internship program. Future internship program dates will be posted on our website.
As a Data Intern you must be able to work from one of our participating offices: Ottawa (150 O’Connor Street) or Toronto (620 King West).



Please note: if you don’t currently live in Ottawa or Toronto, you must be willing and able to relocate for in-office experiences to the closest Shopify office to you. If successful in your application to the Data Internship Program, we will match you to a team when you start at Shopify.

Onboarding 🧠


Interns must be located in their office city by the first day of Onboarding (January 5th) ready to work 9:00am - 5:00pm. You can’t work from outside Canada.



Qualifications ✨


You love challenging yourself with projects or hacking just for fun
You are a constant learner
You have a passion for solving tough problems with code
You take ownership of the projects you work on
You enjoy research and figuring out how pieces of an entire project work
You take pride in creating simple solutions to complex problems
You have a strong commitment to quality

We know that applying for internships can be time-consuming, and we truly appreciate your effort. Our Intern Program team are actual real live people (👋🏻) and we’re looking forward to learning more about you through your application.

We encourage candidates to apply early as applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. Applications will close September 15th at 11:59pm (EDT).

Our hiring process is unique. We match interns to teams we think they'd be successful in and what works best for Shopify.

About Shopify

Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights of their potential. Since 2006, we’ve grown to over 8,300 employees and generated over $1 trillion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.

This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.

About You

Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.

Before you apply, consider if you can:


Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone
Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth
Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)
Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change
Bring critical thought and opinion
Use AI tools reflexively as part of your fundamental workflow
Embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward
Work digital-first for your daily work

Minimum of four (4) years of experience in business intelligence, data analytics, and solving complex quantitative business challenges, preferably within the transportation, construction, or public sector industries.

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements



Travel:-

With an easy-to-use app and industry-specific solutions, 7shifts saves time, reduces errors, and helps keep costs in check for over 55,000 restaurants. Our mission is to simplify team management and improve performance for restaurants, with a long-term vision of creating a thriving restaurant industry through the power of connected & engaged teams.




As the Data Analyst at 7shifts, reporting to the Manager of Data & Analytics, you will act as a dedicated partner to our Payroll and Tips teams. You’ll help them measure what matters, uncover meaningful insights, and identify opportunities to drive business impact. Your expertise will guide the development of KPIs, data best practices, research, reporting, and visualizations that inform decisions and move the team forward. You’ll also be supported by a collaborative data team, including other analysts, analytics engineers, data engineers, and leaders, who work together to enable data-driven decisions across the company.




What you’ll do:

Conduct in-depth analyses using SQL and BI tools to identify trends, measure performance, and uncover actionable insights
Build, maintain, and enhance dashboards and recurring reports that provide accurate, timely, and business-relevant information
Develop and maintain data models using dbt and SQL to transform raw data into clean, reliable, and scalable datasets for analysis and reporting
Partner with teams across the organization to understand data needs, define analytical approaches, and deliver data-driven recommendations
Provide timely ad hoc analyses and contribute to building self-serve data tools and resources that empower teams to independently explore and use data
Validate, reconcile, and troubleshoot data to ensure accuracy and reliability in reporting and decision-making
Effectively present findings and recommendations to both technical and non-technical audiences in a clear and actionable way




What you bring:

Strong proficiency in SQL with the ability to write complex queries and work with large datasets
Hands-on experience with BI tools such as Tableau, Looker, or Power BI (bonus if you’ve used Thoughtspot)
Experience building and maintaining data models using dbt
Background in business, analytics, or a technical field
Proven ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams
Strong communication skills, with the ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical audiences
Experience working in a SaaS or tech environment




It’d be even cooler if you had:

Experience working with Snowflake as a data warehouse
Familiarity with event analytics tools like Mixpanel or Amplitude
Experience working with Salesforce or other CRM tools




Our commitment to our Shifties:

Opportunity: Our product is evolving in exciting ways, and we’re focused on delivering even more value to restaurants. This momentum creates real opportunities to learn and grow. Whether you’re honing your craft or exploring new paths, you’ll be supported and empowered to own your growth and impact a product shaping the future of the restaurant industry.
Challenge: We’re tackling real problems in a fast-moving, complex industry. The work is scrappy and ambiguous, but meaningful. You’ll think critically, act with intention, and shape solutions that make a real difference for restaurant teams.
Culture: We’re proud to be recognized among the best workplaces in North America. Guided by our mission and values, we move fast to solve meaningful problems and celebrate wins together. Whether through in-office and remote events, team offsites like Sparks, or everyday moments of connection, we create space for shared growth, collaboration, and fun.
Equity: We’re a Series C, VC-backed SaaS company, and we believe everyone should share in the success they help create. When we build together, we grow together.
Health and Wellness: We support Shifties in and outside of work, knowing that what people need can change over time. From day one, you’ll have access to benefits like health and dental, lifestyle spending accounts to a parental leave program built with flexibility in mind, to help you bring your best self to work.
Flexibility: Our team is intentional around how and where we work, whether remotely, in person, or a mix of both. We prioritize candidates who thrive in a hybrid work environment with offices in Saskatoon and Toronto, ensuring in-person collaboration and connection when possible. Plus, we offer a flexible vacation policy to encourage everyone to recharge when needed. Oh, and our ‘90 Day Shift’ program lets Shift work from (almost) anywhere because who wouldn’t want to trade their desk for a beach view once in a while?
Support: We set Shifties up for success with the tools they need, like the latest Apple tech, a home office setup, and some 7shifts swag to make it official. But support goes beyond day one. We’re serious about professional growth, offering coaching, feedback, development planning, and opportunities to grow from within.




We know you might not check every box, and that’s okay. If you’re excited about this role, inspired to contribute to a meaningful product, and eager to share ideas that drive real change, we’d love to hear from you. We’re building an inclusive team that reflects the diverse industry we serve, and we welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

Making fans - That's what we're all about! Since our humble beginnings in 2011, these two words have driven Big Viking Games to become the successful company it is today. We are focused on making our mark as a next-generation, live operations games company.

We believe that each Viking is unique and brings exponential value to the company. In return, we provide Vikings with the opportunity to solve problems through continuous learning and fostering feedback, ultimately mastering their craft. By investing in our Vikings and in new technologies, we can continue our success for years to come.

We are embarking on an adventure and rely on our team of skilled, enthusiastic, and collaborative Vikings to turn our ship towards a new horizon.

About the Role:

Big Viking Games is looking for a Staff Product Data Analyst to join our team and own analytics for our flagship titles—YoWorld and FishWorld. Embedded within our cross-functional product pods, you'll partner with Product, Marketing, FP&A and Data to: evaluate player behaviour, refine monetization strategies, and architect predictive models, revenue forecasts, and agentic workflows that automate key live-ops processes.

Reporting into the Product org, this Staff-level role is ideal for someone who thrives in a fast-paced, hypothesis-driven environment and wants their dashboards, forecasts and automation to directly impact millions of players.

You'll help drive smarter decisions across roadmap planning, feature development, campaign performance, and in-game economy optimization—while championing first-principles analytics, machine-learning pipelines, and self-serve data automation.

What You'll Do:


End-to-end analytics & modelling
Build and maintain dashboards (DAU, player spend, content performance, pricing effectiveness) for stakeholders across Product, Marketing and Finance
Analyze player behaviour, campaign performance and monetization trends to inform roadmap and live-ops tuning
Develop predictive models and forecasting pipelines (e.g. adoption curves, revenue projections, churn risk) using first-principles thinking.
Impact & experimentation
Lead A/B test design, impact analysis and lift measurement for Gem Events, Challenges, Reactivation Offers and new gameplay features (ex. SplashO, Storylines)
Partner with FP&A to quantify cost savings and migration impacts
Automation & scalability
Identify inefficiencies in IAP config, asset throughput and content velocity—recommend and build agentic workflows to streamline campaign planning and delivery
Collaborate with Data Engineering to operationalize data pipelines, enable self-serve analytics and embed predictive insights into product dashboards.
Cross-functional thought partnership
Translate complex quantitative findings into clear, actionable recommendations for PMs, engineers and live-ops leads
Evangelize next-gen analytics best practices, mentor junior analysts and shape our data-driven culture


Requirements

The Must-Haves:


6+ years in product, business or game analytics—ideally in mobile or live-ops gaming
Expert SQL skills; ability to wrangle messy data into clean, performant datasets
Proficiency in Python or R and experience with ML libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)
Hands-on experience building and maintaining BI dashboards (Looker, Tableau, Power BI or similar)
Ability to blend descriptive analytics (""What happened? Why?"") with predictive insight (""What will happen? How can we optimize?"")
Proven track record applying first-principles thinking to build and validate forecasting and predictive models that drove measurable product or revenue impact (validating assumptions, testing holdout samples, iterating on feature engineering)
Ability to translate complex data insights into concise stories and actionable recommendations


The Nice-To-Haves:


Experience with in-game economy design or IAP configuration.
Familiarity with A/B testing frameworks (Optimizely, Firebase, custom tooling).
Background in automated data pipelines and agentic workflow tools.
Master's degree in a quantitative field (Statistics, Economics, Computer Science) or equivalent experience.

Comprehensive benefits package (health, dental, and vision) including Health + Wellness spending account

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements

The Position

Uplight is creating a new category of energy. We make software that manages energy resources in homes and businesses—including things like smart thermostats, electric vehicles, solar panels, storage batteries, heat pumps, and even people’s behavior—to generate, shift, or save energy to balance the grid, making it more efficient and reliable. This creates clean energy capacity that can be used by the power grid instead of burning more fossil fuels. Our solutions accelerate the transition to clean energy and save money for energy customers.

We are seeking a Data Engineer focusing on data platform enablement to support our mission and scale our impact

How You Will Make An Impact

As a Data Engineer at Uplight, you’ll play a central role in designing and maintaining the infrastructure that ingests, transforms, and delivers data across our platform. Your work ensures that data systems are reliable, scalable, observable, and cost-efficient—forming the backbone of many customer-facing and data science-driven solutions.

You’ll partner with cross-functional teams including analysts, product managers, and data scientists to ensure the platform meets the evolving needs of our business and our users.

What You Get To Do


Design, build, and maintain data pipelines using Databricks (Spark, Delta Lake) and Python.
Collaborate across teams to develop core platform capabilities—such as orchestration, metadata management, and data quality—delivering scalable, reusable solutions
Improve reliability and fault tolerance of ingest pipelines handling large volumes of utility data.
Build and support MLOps tooling, including data pipelines, model registries, and serving infrastructure
Participate in the full software development lifecycle: design, build, test, deploy, and support
Contribute to a remote-first team that values agility, collaboration, and clarity—favoring whiteboarding, async design docs, and reflective retros over rigid ceremonies.
Continuously learn and grow with support from senior engineers and team leads
Help maintain a team culture rooted in curiosity, empathy, and continuous improvement


What You Bring To Uplight


2–5 years of software engineering experience, ideally in backend or data-focused roles
Experience with Databricks, Spark, or similar big data technologies
Proficiency in Python and SQL
Exposure to cloud platforms such as GCP or AWS
Familiarity with CI/CD tools and infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Docker, Terraform, CircleCI)
Strong communication and collaboration skills; a team player excited to learn and grow


Bonus Points


Familiarity with MLOps concepts and tools (e.g., MLflow, model versioning)
Experience with real-time or streaming data systems (e.g., Kafka, Structured Streaming)
Understanding of data observability, lineage, and quality
Prior work in the energy or utility space
Strong grasp of Big Data challenges including cost vs performance tradeoffs


Don’t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women, marginalized genders and people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification. At Uplight we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

Remote (+/- 4.5 hours from Pacific Time) or in-lab (Surrey, BC, Canada)
Compensation: CAD $80k-95k plus options, based on your skills, qualifications and level of relevant experience
Benefits package
Support for professional development




Who we’re looking for:

We are seeking a skilled Data Integration Specialist with strong enterprise coding abilities and experience handling large volumes of diverse datasets. You should be comfortable working with clients to understand their data landscape and technical constraints, mapping data to our platform, and developing robust, scalable data pipelines. We value teammates who are collaborative, detail-oriented, and proactive in troubleshooting and improving data processes. You would relish a position where your work will play a key role in enabling the global transition to clean energy, supporting a more sustainable future.




Key qualities:

Strong enterprise coding skills (Python preferred)
Strong data munging skills
Experience with libraries and technologies for processing large datasets in a wide variety of formats (CSV, parquet, JSON, XML, GDB, etc.)
Strong data privacy and security mindset and habits
Good SQL proficiency
Experience with cloud storage tools (e.g. AWS S3, Azure Blob, etc.)
Excellent communication and client interaction skills
Willingness to travel for client engagements as needed (Awesense has business globally)
Problem-solving mindset and ability to work in a team environment

Nice-to-have:

Familiarity with geospatial, network, or time series data and/or electrical-utility data is a plus
Experience with cloud provider data pipeline management tools (e.g. AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory, Apache Airflow, etc.) and overall cloud analytics platforms (e.g. Azure Fabric)
Experience using software in containers (e.g. Docker)
Familiarity with data science notebooks (e.g. Jupyter)




Who we are:

Our goal is to transform the planet into one that is fuelled by modern, reliable and clean energy.  For over a decade we’ve helped utilities & energy providers optimize and modernize their grid through our cloud-based grid analytics solutions.




The problem we’re solving:

The electrical grid was designed for a one-way flow of energy, with generation at the top and consumption at the edges. To enable clean energy on the scale required to address climate change (decarbonization), the grid of tomorrow needs to allow for distributed energy sources (DERs), in the form of clean generation (e.g. solar), storage (e.g. batteries) and electric vehicles, that can reside anywhere in the grid (decentralization). To achieve that, digitalization is key. Many disparate data sources must be brought together and their validity ensured so that smart-grid applications can be built on top.  At Awesense, we have built some of these applications ourselves. Our current goal is providing a digital layer via an API-based energy data platform so that other solution providers, partners, and even energy companies can easily build such applications on top of it – and performance at scale is paramount. We want you to help with this as part of our services team.




Main responsibilities:
Client Engagement:
Talk with clients to understand what data they collect—including geospatial, graph/network, and time series data—in which systems, and how it can be extracted.
Identify data relationships and constraints, and business rules that must be enforced.
Determine the best way to map the client’s data to the Awesense data model, cross-referencing the different data types.
Data Integration Development:
Write code to retrieve data from source or intermediate systems.
Validate data against defined constraints.
Transform and cross-link data according to the mapping and prepare for ingestion.
Call Awesense REST APIs to push data into the platform.
Use Awesense REST & SQL APIs to retrieve, cross-reference, or validate previously ingested data.
Pipeline Management:
Develop code for both one-time ingestion and, importantly, ongoing data ingestion pipelines.
Ensure code is robust to errors and provides comprehensive logging and reporting.
Monitor, troubleshoot, and improve data pipelines.
Collaboration:
Work with teammates for code review and quality assurance.




What you’ll assist with:
Work with the client manager to report issues back to clients and iterate on solutions as needed.
Help improve data integration processes and tools.
When not working on client projects, assist either with platform development or implementing use cases on top of the platform APIs

﻿

What you’ll learn:
Problems and emerging solutions around grid decarbonization and the future-of-energy analytics sector.
