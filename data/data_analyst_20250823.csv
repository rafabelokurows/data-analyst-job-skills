Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Working remotely at Stripe

A remote location is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We believe that proactively seeking out different points of view, listening to others, learning, and reflecting on what we’ve heard creates a sense of belonging within PitchBook and strengthens the PitchBook community.

We are excited to get to know you and your background. Concerned that you might not meet every requirement? We encourage you to still apply as you might be the right candidate for the role or other roles at PitchBook.

Provide Data Partnership: Act as a key data partner for the Guest Experience & Operations teams, supporting them with ad-hoc data extractions, analysis, and generating insights to answer critical business questions as they arise.

Want to make an impact? Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.




We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.




Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, we work closely with our teams in Barcelona, San Antonio, Spokane, and remote locations. We’ve got a reputation for being a great place to work, having been named among the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Seattle Business Magazine and Washington’s Best Workplaces in the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies.




At Rover, our furry coworkers are just as important as our human ones—and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Along with making the joys of pet parenthood more accessible, we’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community of pet people—and that starts with our employees.




Who we're looking for:

The Marketing Analytics team supports the company’s marketing efforts, while also working with teams throughout the organization. The analytics team is responsible for a number of business-critical reports and data models that our global marketing teams rely on for daily reporting, budgeting, and analysis. We measure marketing attribution to understand how people become Rover customers, provide campaign reporting to monitor trends in cost efficiency and optimization, deliver lifecycle data to action against a variety of customer behaviors, and narrate the business to identify and prioritize new opportunities.




We are looking for an Analyst to support our Growth, International Expansion, Lifecycle, and SEO stakeholders with a focus on improving our reporting and dashboard structure. The ideal candidate will have experience working closely with business stakeholders and building data-driven narratives that enable clear decision making.




*This is a hybrid position that has the minimum expectation to work out of our Barcelona Office in the Poblenou neighborhood two days per week on Mondays and Thursdays. For this reason, candidates must be based in Barcelona or willing to relocate.




Your Responsibilities:

Work closely with analytics peers and marketing teams to narrate trends and insights, with a particular focus on our customer acquisition marketing programs.
Design reports and dashboards that enable clear, data-driven decision-making for marketing and cross-functional teams.
Refine our marketing attribution models to drive optimal resource allocation across paid and organic marketing channels.
Expand your expertise by supporting experiments such as A/B testing and Market Match tests to optimize strategies across multiple marketing functions.




Your Qualifications:

At least 2 years experience working with complex datasets to support business decision making.
Fluency in SQL.
Data visualisation tool experience (e.g. Mode, Looker, Tableau, etc.)
Ability to adapt your communication style to translate complex data insights for different audiences.
You have experience in owning small-to-medium projects from design to completion with limited guidance from your manager.
You understand when you are blocked, proactively seeking out for help within the team or the organization to move the project forward.




Nice to Have:

Python or R familiarity is helpful, but we welcome candidates eager to develop these skills.
Experience evaluating results of A/B tests as well as expertise in statistical analysis.
Understanding of marketing metrics such as clicks, CPC, CTR, impressions, and unit economics like customer LTV, payback period, and CAC.




Benefits of working at Rover:

Competitive compensation
Long-term incentive plan with a company performance-based cash payout
Permanent contract
Pension plan
Meal tickets through Cobee
Generous PTO allowance
Private health insurance
Discounted gym membership
Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time)
Monetary help for adopting a dog or cat plus yearly credit to use on our platform
A wide variety of snacks, fresh fruit, and beverages in our kitchen to keep yourself going
Regular team activities, including happy hours, game nights, and more

About 4mativ Technologies, Inc.

4MATIV Technologies manages multi-modal mobility for school systems nationwide with technology to expand options and enhance service. We envision a future where all children have access to the learning opportunities that maximize their potential, and we are reimagining transportation to accelerate student outcomes.

We partner with schools to improve service, safety, and holistic sustainability, ensuring all students have access to the right ride. Currently, we manage transportation for over 50 school districts across cities including Houston, Indianapolis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Phoenix, simplifying operations and expanding services for families. Every school day, 4MATIV manages outsourced vendors and operates a contact center supporting more than 22,000 student trips across over 1,000 routes for schools across the country.

Our Client Services team provides tailored advisory and analysis services. 4MATIV works hand in hand with education organizations to design flexible, local solutions that meet the needs of every learner. We partner with school districts to optimize transportation systems, identify efficiencies, and design lasting solutions. We support some of the nation's largest public school districts and charter organizations as trusted mobility advisors. Our projects aim to enhance client understanding and empower them to drive meaningful system improvements. Data-driven insights are at the core of our work, using advanced analysis and tools to set us apart in the industry.

Our team is committed to:


Working shoulder-to-shoulder with our clients as a mission-aligned and trusted partner
Valuing diversity of perspectives and experiences
Care for every detail and outcome
Constant learning and improvement


Position Overview

4MATIV is a rapidly growing company with an increasingly broad portfolio of consulting clients. As our list of client districts and state education agencies grows, the need for a robust, productive, and knowledgeable team of analysts is increasingly important to our business. This key member to our growing team will have the ability to contribute greatly to the direction and operation of this team and business function. We're looking for someone that is enthusiastic, willing to bring new ideas, and looking to learn and grow alongside the company.

The Data Analyst will play a key role in crafting intuitive, insightful, and rigorous analyses that inspire and guide our clients to implement new student mobility innovations. The ideal candidate is a quick learner, is self-motivated, is analytically gifted, has a drive for creative optimization, and can manage data processes from beginning to end. The candidate will be able to handle a variety of analytical tasks including but not limited to: descriptive analysis of student transportation system performance and configuration, geospatial analysis and visualization of students/schools/terminals, estimation of the impact of different changes to system configuration and optimization (in terms of costs, efficiency, and emissions), and data pipelining. While our team utilizes standardized templates, reusable code, and documented analytic processes, client data is frequently incomplete; this role requires someone who is flexible, innovative, able to make smart assumptions, and capable of leveraging proxy variables in order to produce useful analysis.

Responsibilities

Create and maintain Excel, Google Sheets and other models for consultative projects and or internal operational use.
Use business knowledge, code scripts, and software processes to clean, spot-check, and prepare data from various sources.
Continuously enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of technical task and project delivery, ensuring streamlined processes and minimizing any operational bottlenecks.
Ensure the accuracy and reliability of technical deliverables through application of rigorous quality control measures and review processes.
Integrate data from multiple sources to ensure accuracy, consistency, and accessibility across systems
Summarize, visualize, and present findings to clients in a clear, concise, and engaging manner
Leverage GIS software to produce informative and actionable maps and geospatial insights for both client-facing and internal projects.
Communicate methodologies, assumptions, results, and the significance of analyses through clear written reports and presentations
Collaborate closely with business stakeholders to understand client needs and challenges, translating these into actionable data insights to guide decision-making and strategic initiatives
Uphold and contribute to the continuous improvement of company code documentation standards and data governance policies, ensuring data quality, privacy, and security


Requirements

The candidate should have education and/or experience working with large sets of data in an analytical capacity. The candidate should be detail-oriented and self-motivated in order to drive business processes to completion. The requirements for this position are:

Education and Experience:


Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics, Finance, Industrial Engineering, or a related field
Two (2) years of analytic experience in a relevant field
Experience in data operations in transportation, logistics, or K-12 Education preferred


Technical Skills:


Proficiency in Python & SQL
Proficiency working with data visualization tools such as Microsoft PowerBI
Proficiency in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets
Proficiency working with APIs
Experience with GIS software


Core Competencies:

Are you passionate about improving our environment for this generation and those to follow? Are you ready to take on new challenges and collaborate with a future-focused team leading the way into new markets? Join Nexamp! 

This is where you can learn from industry leaders and become one yourself. It's fast-paced, mission-based work that challenges the status quo. Be on the team that's changing the world. 

What we’re looking for: 

We're looking for a Lead Data Analyst to craft insightful and compelling data stories, empower business owners across Nexamp to make more effective data-driven decisions, and help build our self-service data platform. As one of the nation’s largest and longest tenured solar and storage owner operators – and one of the few that is fully vertically integrated – our data is a differentiator in the market and a catalyst for future growth. You’ll be solving uniquely challenging data problems, alongside a strong team, and for a company in which the business model and mission are inseparably intertwined: our solar farms save customers money, help the planet, and are profitable for Nexamp and its investors. 

This role will be hybrid, based out of our Boston office, and you will report to the Director of Product, Data.

What you’ll do:  

Own and Deliver Data Products: Independently gather requirements for, prioritize, deliver, maintain, and continuously improve reusable data models, dashboards, analyses, A/B tests, and other data assets. Act as the product manager and implementer for your domain’s data offerings. Implement work using advanced SQL and BI tool skills. 
Be a Trusted Data Partner: Become the subject matter expert for data in your business areas. Identify opportunities for impact, proactively surface insights, support decision-making, and contribute to and influence business strategy and initiatives. Serve as your business stakeholders’ right hand. Support other business areas opportunistically.
Drive Data Quality, Documentation, and Engineering: Create and maintain comprehensive data documentation and communicate updates to your stakeholders. Write user stories or tickets for data engineering, validate data mapping, conduct QA, and implement data quality monitoring.
Foster Data Culture and Adoption: Monitor the usage of data assets, increase data literacy, and promote self-service through BI tools among stakeholders. Provide training, guidance, and support as needed.  
Collaborate Across the Data Team: Work within a centralized data team using agile methodologies. Collaborate with peer analysts through overlapping work, priority shifting, and code reviews to broaden your Nexamp knowledge.
Influence Data Strategy: Partner with the data architect, engineers, scientists, and analysts to shape the vision and roadmap for Nexamp’s data platform. Define and track annual OKRs to measure your impact.  

What you’ll bring: 

5-7 years of experience as a data analyst serving business owners and collaborating with data engineers (experience in the energy/construction industry is a plus, but not required) 
Advanced in SQL and BI tool administration and usage (experience with Databricks and Sigma are a plus, but not required) 
Strong track record of independently solving problems.
Commitment to Nexamp's mission and have a passion for solving tomorrow's climate crisis today.
Demonstrated experience in effectively communicating information, ideas, and perspectives with people inside and beyond your organization.   
Experience in showcasing initiative to make improvements to current work, processes, products, and services across the organization. We value accountability and an ownership mentality. 
Ability to ask appropriate questions, analyze data, identify the root causes of problems, and present creative solutions. 
Expertise in building strong internal and external relationships with customers and stakeholders, instilling trust and loyalty across the industry. 
Eagerness to develop a fundamental understanding of how Nexamp operates and then apply that knowledge effectively to inform business decisions.  

If you don’t meet 100% of the above qualifications, but see yourself contributing, please apply.

At Nexamp, our mission is to build the future of energy so it is clean, simple, and accessible for all. We are committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, veteran status, or any other basis protected by law. By encouraging a culture where ideas and decisions come from all people, we believe it will help us grow, innovate, and be a part of environmental and social change.

You’ll love working here because:  

Not only will you get to take part in meaningful work and have the chance to change the world alongside innovative, dedicated, and motivated peers, but you will also have access to all the benefits that Nexamp offers! This includes our competitive compensation package; a 401(k) employer-match; health, dental, and vision insurance starting day one; flexible paid time off and holiday PTO; commuter benefits, and cell phone reimbursement. We have headquarters in Boston, MA and Chicago, IL, in addition to growing offices nationwide. We provide healthy snacks, coffee, service days and other volunteer opportunities, company outings, and more!  

Nexamp's People team manages all aspects of recruitment and hiring within our organization. We want to inform third-party recruiters, staffing firms, and related agencies that Nexamp does not accept unsolicited resumes. Resumes will only be considered from these entities if a signed agreement is in place and the People team explicitly authorizes external recruiting assistance for a specific position. Any unsolicited resumes received will be deemed the property of Nexamp. We want to emphasize that Nexamp is not liable for any fees associated with unsolicited resumes.
