At Delivery Hero, you‚Äôll shape the global consumer experience for millions of users. Your work will have a direct impact on how we attract and retain customers, creating data-driven, personalized interactions that keep them coming back. As part of our Consumer Team, you‚Äôll enhance customer satisfaction and drive global growth and profitability through innovative projects.

The Consumer Product Analytics Team drives product strategy and innovation by providing actionable insights on customers and products, contributing to business success. In this role, you'll have the opportunity to shape the experience for millions of users across our worldwide portfolio of platforms (FoodPanda, Pedidos Ya, Woowa, Yemeksepeti, Foodora, Talabat, HungerStation, eFood, and Glovo), directly impacting customer satisfaction and driving growth. Our diverse team of data professionals is based in Berlin, working closely with product directors, product managers, engineers, and business stakeholders to directly influence product direction. We collaborate with a larger data team, including data engineers, data scientists, and ML engineers, to share knowledge and expertise.

At Consumer Product Analytics, you will have the opportunity to access high volume, rich user behavior data, engage in end to end product development cycles, work on complex product problems, and learn from many experienced data professionals.

The main responsibilities of the Product Analytics Team include:


Strategic Impact & Product Leadership: Act as a key strategic data partner to product leadership, influencing product roadmap and investment decisions through deep analytical insights and foresight. Proactively identify high-impact analytical opportunities to drive significant customer satisfaction and business growth.

Proactively identify and resolve data quality issues at scale.
Scalable ETL & Reporting Solutions: Design, build, and maintain robust data pipelines and self-service dashboards, ensuring data accessibility and empowering product teams to make data-driven decisions independently.
Deep Dive & Exploratory Analysis: Conduct complex, end-to-end exploratory analyses on large-scale user behavior data (transactional, clickstream, etc.) to uncover non-obvious insights, identify root causes of trends, and directly inform product strategy and roadmap development.
Technical & Mentorship Leadership: Contribute significantly to the growth and development of fellow product analysts through knowledge sharing sessions, best practice dissemination, workflow optimizations, and active participation in hiring and onboarding processes. Champion and drive analytical excellence within the team and broader organization.


Qualifications


9+ years of experience in product analytics or a related data-focused role, preferably within rapidly growing and dynamic environments, and with a broad mission scope or multiple stakeholders.
Experience working in Search & Recommendations systems.
Expert proficiency in SQL and Python for complex data manipulation, analysis, and modeling. Experience with BigQuery and large-scale cloud data warehousing concepts is a strong plus.
Expertise in statistical methods applied to experimental design (A/B testing, multivariate tests, etc.), causal inference, and robust hypothesis validation. You should be able to navigate complex statistical challenges and explain methodologies clearly.
Extensive experience working with large-scale user behavior data (e.g., transactional, clickstream, app usage), including data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to derive actionable insights.
Proficiency with at least one data visualization tool such as Looker Studio (Data Studio), Tableau, QlikView, or Power BI, with a proven ability to create compelling and insightful dashboards.
Demonstrated ability to influence and collaborate with multiple stakeholders, including senior product managers, engineers, and business leaders. You can clearly communicate complex analytical findings and successfully drive large-scale analytics projects end-to-end (e.g., defining success metrics for a tribe, standardizing measurement across brands, or implementing new experimentation methodologies).
Experience with customer behavior tracking platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, MixPanel, Snowplow, Segment, Tealium).


Nice to have:


Experience with Airflow, DBT, or other data pipelining tools

About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

Bombastisch & bezaubernd: das IT-Team, das gemeinsam mit dir spannende Missionen antreten m√∂chte
Abwechslungsreich & vielversprechend: die Zukunft der Dussmann Group, die wir mit dir gestalten werden
Vertrauensvoll & flexibel: deine Arbeitszeiten
Sehenswert & reizvoll: dein Desksharing-Arbeitsplatz in der Friedrichstra√üe sowie inklusive 25% Rabatt auf alle deine Eink√§ufe im Dussmann KulturKaufhaus
Sicher & unbefristet: dein Arbeitsvertrag in einem krisenfesten Konzern
Langfristig & nachhaltig: deine Fort- und Weiterbildungsoptionen z.B. auf unserem Campus in Zeuthen
Gr√ºn & gesund: deine verg√ºnstigte Mittagspause in unserem PLANET!BASED-Restaurant im Untergeschoss
Sensationell & am√ºsant: unsere Mitarbeiterevents wie Stammtisch, After-Work, Sommer- und Weihnachtsfeste, Teamfr√ºhst√ºck etc.
Attraktiv & lukrativ: deine Verg√ºtung


Deine Mission

Du musst kein Superheld sein, um Gro√ües zu bewirken. In der Welt der Daten reicht oft ein klarer Kopf, ein gutes Verst√§ndnis f√ºr komplexe Zusammenh√§nge - und ein bisschen Freude am Coden. Wenn du gerne Strukturen schaffst, wo andere nur Daten sehen, und du dich in modernen Cloud-Technologien genauso wohlf√ºhlst wie im Austausch mit Kolleg:innen aus verschiedenen Bereichen, dann bist du bei uns genau richtig. Wir suchen jemanden, der mit technischem Know-how, Teamgeist und einem Blick f√ºrs Wesentliche unsere Datenplattform weiterentwickelt - und dabei vielleicht sogar ein bisschen Spa√ü hat.


Du baust Datentransformationsstrecken, die nicht nur funktionieren, sondern auch bei Nacht deployt werden k√∂nnen, ohne dass du schwei√ügebadet aufwachst - mit Tools wie Azure Databricks, Apache Airflow oder Azure Data Factory.
Du unterst√ºtzt F√ºhrungskr√§fte, indem du technische Klarheit schaffst - und manchmal auch emotionale Stabilit√§t, wenn das Deployment mal wieder zickt.
Du modellierst Daten, als w√§ren sie Lego-Steine: strukturiert, durchdacht und mit dem gewissen ‚ÄûKlick‚Äú.
Du f√ºhrst Deployments durch, dokumentierst gewissenhaft und sorgst daf√ºr, dass deine Datenqualit√§t nicht nur ‚Äûokay‚Äú, sondern ‚Äûwow‚Äú ist.
Du bist Ansprechpartner:in f√ºr System Owner - also der Mensch, der komplexe Anforderungen in verst√§ndliche L√∂sungen √ºbersetzt (und dabei nicht die Geduld verliert).
Du arbeitest mit dem AI Lab zusammen, wo du daf√ºr sorgst, dass aus fancy Algorithmen auch tats√§chlich funktionierende Produkte werden.
Du kooperierst mit BI Engineers, damit Dashboards nicht nur h√ºbsch aussehen, sondern auch die Wahrheit sagen.
Du bringst dich in Projekte ein, diskutierst Datenarchitektur mit Kolleg:innen und hast dabei sogar gelegentlich Spa√ü.
Du arbeitest mit Fachbereichen und IT, als w√§rst du ein diplomatischer Datenbotschafter - mit technischem Tiefgang und einem offenen Ohr.


Deine Skills


Du hast ein Studium in (Wirtschafts-)Informatik, Statistik oder etwas √§hnlich Nerdigem abgeschlossen - oder dir das Wissen auf anderem Weg draufgeschafft.
Du verstehst Datenmodellierung und Softwarearchitektur - und wei√üt, dass ‚ÄûBig Data‚Äú nicht nur ein Buzzword ist.
Du kennst dich mit Azure aus (Data Factory, Databricks, Data Lake) - oder mit anderen Cloud-Werkzeugen, die mindestens genauso cool sind.
SQL, Python, Spark und GIT sind f√ºr dich keine Fremdw√∂rter, sondern deine t√§glichen Begleiter - fast wie Kaffee.
Du arbeitest selbstst√§ndig, sorgf√§ltig und mit einem Auge f√ºrs Detail - auch wenn‚Äôs mal stressig wird.
Du kannst zwischen Business, IT und deinem Team vermitteln - und bleibst dabei meistens freundlich.
Dein Englisch ist verhandlungssicher - dein Humor optional, aber willkommen

After starting a mere 10 years ago, Octopus is the largest energy supplier in the UK.

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We‚Äôre not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We‚Äôre a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare‚Äôs enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here‚Äôs the deal - we don‚Äôt store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.

To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform‚Äîwhich comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor‚Äôs attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That‚Äôs our promise to such a candidate.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.


What we look for
Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You‚Äôre extremely ambitious in everything you do‚Äîand your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high‚Äîand rising‚Äîbar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You‚Äôre reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.


What we offer
Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You‚Äôll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential‚Äîthen, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you‚Äôve got what it takes, you‚Äôll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of ¬£66,779 in the UK and ‚Ç¨63,965 elsewhere. For a candidate that we assess as possessing considerable relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between ¬£110,389 and ¬£149,636 in the UK, and ‚Ç¨105,737 and ‚Ç¨143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.


Commitment & contract
Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time or part-time.

Location
Milan (Italy), London (UK).

The selection process
If you pass our screening, we‚Äôll ask you to take on a few tests designed to assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. They‚Äôre challenging and may take several hours to complete. If you‚Äôre successful with those, we‚Äôll invite you to a series of interviews.

We set the bar high and won't extend an offer until we're convinced we've found the right candidate. This is why a job may stay open for months or be reposted several times.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn‚Äôt a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and provide reasonable accommodations for an individual with disabilities‚Äîjust let us know through this form.

Before you apply
If you‚Äôve applied before but didn't receive an offer, we recommend waiting at least one year before applying again.

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment. We‚Äôre extremely ambitious and we hold ourselves‚Äîand one another‚Äîto a high standard. While this tends to lead to extraordinary learning, achievement, and career growth, it also requires significant commitment.

To help you ramp up quickly and set yourself up for success, we recommend spending your first few months working from our Milan office, regardless of your long-term work location. It‚Äôs the best way to rapidly absorb our company culture and build trust with your new teammates. We‚Äôll support you with generous travel and accommodation assistance. After that, you‚Äôre welcome to work from our offices in Milan or London, or remotely from approved countries‚Äîdepending on what we agree at the offer stage.

If the role speaks to you and you‚Äôre excited to give your best, we‚Äôd love to hear from you. Apply now‚Äîwe can‚Äôt wait to meet you.

Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.<br><br>Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer.

It‚Äôs the best way to rapidly absorb our company culture and build trust with your new teammates. We‚Äôll support you with generous travel and accommodation assistance.

Our commitment to our Shifties:

Opportunity: Our product is evolving in exciting ways, and we‚Äôre focused on delivering even more value to restaurants. This momentum creates real opportunities to learn and grow. Whether you‚Äôre honing your craft or exploring new paths, you‚Äôll be supported and empowered to own your growth and impact a product shaping the future of the restaurant industry.
Challenge: We‚Äôre tackling real problems in a fast-moving, complex industry. The work is scrappy and ambiguous, but meaningful. You‚Äôll think critically, act with intention, and shape solutions that make a real difference for restaurant teams.
Culture: We‚Äôre proud to be recognized among the best workplaces in North America. Guided by our mission and values, we move fast to solve meaningful problems and celebrate wins together. Whether through in-office and remote events, team offsites like Sparks, or everyday moments of connection, we create space for shared growth, collaboration, and fun.
Equity: We‚Äôre a Series C, VC-backed SaaS company, and we believe everyone should share in the success they help create. When we build together, we grow together.
Health and Wellness: We support Shifties in and outside of work, knowing that what people need can change over time. From day one, you‚Äôll have access to benefits like health and dental, lifestyle spending accounts to a parental leave program built with flexibility in mind, to help you bring your best self to work.
Flexibility: Our team is intentional around how and where we work, whether remotely, in person, or a mix of both. We prioritize candidates who thrive in a hybrid work environment with offices in Saskatoon and Toronto, ensuring in-person collaboration and connection when possible. Plus, we offer a flexible vacation policy to encourage everyone to recharge when needed. Oh, and our ‚Äò90 Day Shift‚Äô program lets Shift work from (almost) anywhere because who wouldn‚Äôt want to trade their desk for a beach view once in a while?
Support: We set Shifties up for success with the tools they need, like the latest Apple tech, a home office setup, and some 7shifts swag to make it official. But support goes beyond day one. We‚Äôre serious about professional growth, offering coaching, feedback, development planning, and opportunities to grow from within.




We know you might not check every box, and that‚Äôs okay. If you‚Äôre excited about this role, inspired to contribute to a meaningful product, and eager to share ideas that drive real change, we‚Äôd love to hear from you. We‚Äôre building an inclusive team that reflects the diverse industry we serve, and we welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

Inspect ultrasound data to identify and annotate features and defects
Create 3D visualizations and renderings from raw ultrasound data
Generate and edit detailed reports for client delivery
Help define processes and training for the ILI data analysis team

Who You Are (Basic Qualifications)

Experience in at least one of:

What Will Put You Ahead

Experience in NDE/NDT
Experience in the Oil & Gas industry
Experience gathering, evaluating, and investigating image/computer vision data, particularly ultrasound imaging
Experience working with spatial or GIS data
Programming experience in Python
Demonstrated ability as a self-starter and independent contributor, adept at efficiently and proactively managing new tasks
Advanced English communication skills (written and verbal)
