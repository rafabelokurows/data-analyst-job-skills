Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years experience in Business Intelligence Engineering, Data Engineering, Data Analysis or Data Science roles, building data pipelines and analyzing large datasets to solve problems
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail
Ability to clearly communicate results and drive impact
Comfortable collaborating across functions to identify data analytics problems and execute solutions with technical rigor and data-driven insights.



Preferred Qualifications


Master’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or a related technical field.
Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.
Experience with distributed data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark to write and debug data pipelines.
Good understanding of development processes and best practices like engineering standards, code reviews, and testing.
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, Greater NYC Area, or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Working remotely at Stripe

A remote location is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Job Summary

DaVita Revenue Operations (ROPS) is modernizing its approach to data insights by replacing legacy reporting with a new suite of Tableau dashboards. The goal is to provide business partners with reliable, real-time analytics to support better decision-making.

As an Insights Analyst, you will work in agile, cross-functional teams to develop dashboards and translate complex data into clear, actionable insights. The role involves close collaboration with business leaders and requires strong analytical skills, technical acumen, and the ability to communicate findings effectively.

Tableau experience is important, but we are also interested in candidates with a strong record of problem-solving, a solid understanding of business operations (especially in healthcare revenue cycle), and a willingness to learn and grow within the analytics field.

What Success Looks Like


Business partners consistently turn to you and your dashboards for insights that drive operational and strategic decisions.
Tableau dashboards become the primary self-serve tools for real-time data, replacing outdated manual processes.
You help cultivate a culture of data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement throughout DaVita Revenue Operations (ROPS).

Develop interactive Tableau dashboards and visualizations that resonate with end users, empowering self-service analytics across the organization.


Engage & Understand:


Build trusted relationships with business partners across functional areas such as collections and registration to map processes, document workflows, and identify unmet reporting needs.
Ask the right questions to uncover not just what data is needed, but why, helping shape metrics that align with business priorities.


Partner Across Teams:


Collaborate with Database Analysts, Subject Matter Experts, and Project Analysts to ensure dashboards are accurate, timely, and actionable.
Liaise with Backend Analysts on data infrastructure needs, supporting the delivery of reliable, quality data.


Champion Continuous Improvement:


Gather and synthesize feedback to iterate on dashboard designs and reporting approaches.
Embrace experimentation and learning, viewing challenges as opportunities to innovate.


Support, Document, and Train:


Provide support for dashboard users, troubleshoot issues, and document best practices.
Contribute to user guides and training sessions, helping others unlock the power of data at DaVita Revenue Operations (ROPS).


Required Skills & Experience


Demonstrated success translating data into business insights and actionable recommendations.
Experience working with dashboards and visualizations, ideally using Tableau or a similar BI platform.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, able to understand and tell the story behind the numbers.
Technical acumen, comfortable working with data, whether through SQL queries, Excel, or other relevant tools.
Excellent communication, relationship-building, and partner engagement skills.
A learning mindset and the drive to continually expand your skills and knowledge.


Preferred Qualifications


Advanced Tableau experience, including design, calculations, and interactivity.
Experience working in healthcare analytics or revenue cycle operations.
Familiarity with SQL, ETL, data modeling, or modern data warehousing concepts.
Background in process improvement, change management, or agile project delivery.
Experience supporting or training business users in BI solutions.

The User Operations team is central to ensuring that our customers' experience with our products is nothing short of exceptional. We resolve complex issues, provide technical guidance, and support customers in maximizing value and adoption from deploying our products. We work closely with Sales, Technical Success, Product, Engineering and others to deliver the best possible experience to our customers at scale. OpenAI's customers represent a range of diverse backgrounds and maturity, from early-stage startups to established global enterprises. Given OpenAI’s breakneck shipping cadence and growth—and the expectation that it will only accelerate—transforming our rich support data into real‑time insights and scalable, self‑serve analytics is critical to sustaining exceptional customer experiences on the path to AGI.

About The Role

We’re seeking a User Operations Data Analyst who will dig deep into user‑support data—surfacing trends, volumes, and friction signals—and turn these findings into actionable insights and always‑on reporting. You’ll design, build, and maintain self‑serve dashboards that keep every stakeholder informed in real time, partnering closely with Data Science and Engineering to ensure clean pipelines, robust models, and scalable tooling. Think proactive friction detection and real‑time service‑health views that help us stay ahead of demand—delivering decision‑grade insights, not just prettier slide decks.

This role is based in San Francisco, California. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In This Role, You Will


Explore large support and product datasets to uncover trends, volume drivers, and user‑experience pain points, distilling findings into clear, actionable narratives.
Build, enhance, and maintain self‑serve dashboards and reporting tools, enabling non‑technical teams to answer their own data questions.
Establish a unified metrics taxonomy for service‑health and performance—and build automated data‑sharing pipelines and scorecards with our BPO partners to ensure everyone operates from the same real‑time view of success
Leverage LLMs to build bespoke classifiers that automatically label and segment inbound volumes—powering smarter routing, richer self‑serve insights, and swifter root‑cause analysis.
Partner with Data Engineering to ensure reliable pipelines, implement data‑quality checks, and document sources of truth.
Jump into high‑priority special projects to conduct bespoke deep‑dive analyses and deliver clear, strategic recommendations to leadership.
Prototype quickly—leveraging ChatGPT, Jupyter notebooks, Retool, and other tools—to prove value before hardening with Engineering.
Collaborate with Data Science on predictive models and experimentation, translating results into operational recommendations.


You Might Thrive In This Role If You


8 + years in analytics, business intelligence, or data science, ideally supporting customer support or operations teams.
Expert‑level SQL skills and proficiency in Python or R for advanced analysis and automation
Hands‑on experience designing and maintaining BI dashboards (e.g. Looker, Mode, Tableau, Sundial) with a focus on clarity and self‑serve usability.
Hands‑on experience fine‑tuning or prompt‑engineering LLMs to build text classifiers, sentiment analysis, or tagging systems.
Demonstrated ability to translate complex datasets into clear business stories and recommendations for both technical and non‑technical audiences.
Familiarity with support metrics (SLAs, FCR, deflection) and ability to define service health KPIs.
Strong cross‑functional communication skills—comfortable collaborating daily with engineers, data scientists, and operations leaders.
An eye for detail, a zero‑defect mindset, and a bias toward action over theoretical perfection
Possess a strong bias for automation and can defend governance decisions that keep data and processes healthy as they grow.
Thrive in a fast‑moving, ambiguous environment where priorities can shift quickly.

In this role, you will work with Engineering, Marketing, and Sales to conduct data-oriented analysis to inform the strategic marketing direction.

Our job is to demonstrate how Google's products solve the world's problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.

Marketing Intelligence – instantly answers questions like “What led to that sudden drop in pipeline?”
Account Intelligence – surfaces next-best actions to help reps move target accounts toward conversion


Since launching in January 2023, we’ve come through Y Combinator, raised a $20M Series A led by Bessemer. We’re growing 3× year-over-year, have hit multimillion ARR, and process over 60 TB of GTM data monthly. Based at our San Francisco HQ, we operate fully in-person, move fast and hire people who are ready to win.

🚀 Your Mission

We are seeking a customer-focused Data Analyst to help our clients answer their most important business questions around GTM revenue performance and marketing spend optimization. This is not a heavy data-engineering role; instead, you’ll use HockeyStack’s platform and available data to guide customers toward impactful insights and recommendations.

🔧 What You’ll Do


Partner with customers to solve their revenue goals, challenges, and questions. Use HockeyStack’s platform to uncover insights and deliver clear, actionable recommendations.
Translate complex metrics into straightforward explanations for non-technical audiences.
Be the Data Partner to support Customer Success Managers in delivering strategic guidance to clients.
Identify patterns and trends in marketing and sales data to advise customers on where to focus efforts.
Collaborate with internal teams to continuously enhance the customer experience.


🧩 Core Strengths


Business Insight: Ability to connect data to revenue outcomes and business strategy.
Customer Orientation: Skilled at understanding client goals and delivering value through insights.
Analytical Thinking: Comfortable framing and answering complex questions with data-driven logic.
Clear Communication: Able to translate analytics into simple, impactful recommendations.


🧬 What We’re Looking For


Ownership-first mindset — you take initiative, move fast, and figure things out
Thrive in early-stage, high-urgency environments where speed and impact matter
Curious, self-aware, and feedback-driven — you bring energy, not ego
See this role as a defining chapter — not a stepping stone or side quest
Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Data Science, Applied Economics, or a related field.
1–3 years of experience in Data Analytics or Consulting with Analytical focus. Strong preference for candidates with Marketing Analytics or GTM/Sales Analytics Experience.
Strong problem-solving skills with the ability to structure and answer key business questions.
Excellent communication skills to convey data-driven insights to senior stakeholders.
Familiarity with SaaS, B2B marketing, or revenue analytics is a strong plus.
Ability to think strategically and recommend actions based on data, without needing to deep-dive into raw datasets.


✨ Why Join Now?

We’re at an inflection point. The product is proven, the market is massive, and the opportunity is wide open. You’ll be joining a company with real traction, rapid growth, and meaningful backing—where every person still shapes the outcome. This isn’t just a job. It’s a chance to build something category-defining with people who care deeply about doing it right.

We’re building a high-performing, in-person culture at our San Francisco HQ, where the team collaborates shoulder-to-shoulder five days a week. While that's our standard for most roles, this position is uniquely flexible—offering remote options for exceptional candidates based in the U.S. or internationally, as long as you're fully available during U.S. business hours. The base salary range for this role is $40,000 to $120,000 USD, adjusted for location, experience, and qualifications.

HockeyStack is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, protected veteran status, disability, or any other legally protected status. We celebrate diversity and are committed to fostering an inclusive environment for all employees.

We’ve spent the past few years implementing new systems and processes - now comes the fun part of bringing the data together to tell stories across the recruiting and employee lifecycles!

This is a full time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.

What you’ll do at Figma:


Develop and maintain dashboards and analytics tools across the employee lifecycle that equip the People team and business leaders with timely, actionable insights.
Use SQL to extract, clean, and organize data from multiple People systems—ensuring it is structured, accurate, and ready to power reporting, dashboards, and analytics products across the employee lifecycle.
Design, manage, and evolve a centralized metrics library that defines and standardizes key people metrics across the employee lifecycle, supporting consistent reporting and analysis.

Create clear documentation, training, and enablement resources to support non-technical users in confidently navigating dashboards and making data-informed decisions.
Establish feedback loops with end users to continuously improve dashboard usability, identify reporting gaps, and ensure data products evolve with stakeholder needs.


We'd love to hear from you if you have:


Approximately 5 years of experience in HR or Recruiting, people analytics, or a related field, with exposure to People or Talent data.
Demonstrated experience with basic SQL and can independently write clean, efficient queries to manipulate fields and join data across systems
Familiarity with HR systems like Workday, Greenhouse, Gem, CultureAmp, or similar tools, and a willingness to deepen your understanding over time.
Experience working with a BI tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI), or a people analytics reporting tool (e.g., OneModel, Visier).
A builder’s mindset—you’re excited by the challenge of designing scalable solutions that reduce manual work and increase self-service.
A passion for clean, accurate, and reliable data, along with experience driving process improvements to enhance data quality.
Problem-first mindset with strong analytical curiosity— you go beyond surface-level requests to understand the true business need and deliver solutions that solve the right problem.
A collaborative working style, with the ability to partner across HR, Recruiting, L&D, and engineering teams to execute on a roadmap.


While not required, it’s an added plus if you also have:


Experience scaling OneModel in a high-growth environment.
Experience with report writing in Workday.

More than 70% of what we consume in the U.S. is moved by trucks. Those trucks are powered by over 3.5 million drivers per year and create over $700B in annual revenue. Trucking is a massive industry but it is a traditional industry and like many traditional industries, it is ripe for innovation.

CloudTrucks is building the operating system for trucking and is the first platform specifically designed to empower truck drivers. Our all-in-one, “business in a box” solution optimizes and automates operations and accelerates cash-flow for drivers, so they can focus on building their business.

The Data Analytics team at CloudTrucks owns all business reporting end-to-end, and develops both internal and customer-facing, data analytics products in collaboration with Product development teams.

As a Data Analyst supporting the Go-To-Market (GTM) teams at CloudTrucks, you’ll have the opportunity to work with multiple teams across the company, including Sales, RevOps, Marketing and Growth Engineering. You’ll own data pipelines, reporting and in-depth analyses that help these teams make day-to-day product and business decisions.

Examples of projects that you may work on


Growth Engineering Our Growth engineering team has the mission to scale our driver onboarding flow. As a data analyst, you’ll play a key role helping PMs and engineers build metrics to ensure they have adequate visibility into the onboarding flow, help them define, run and measure experiments and gather insights about future product improvements.
Marketing Our Marketing team is focused on driver acquisition. As a data analyst, you’ll have the opportunity to work closely with them to continue building and improving our Marketing Attribution models, and provide insights into the Marketing funnel and campaign performance.
RevOps Our RevOps team works closely with Sales to onboard drivers to CloudTrucks. As a data analyst, you’ll have the opportunity to help the team track and measure each step of the sales funnel and look for opportunities where processes can be improved. You’ll be able to combine sales and product data to do in-depth analysis and provide insights into funnel performance, define, build and monitor revenue impact metrics.


Responsibilities


Own end-to-end reporting from building the data pipeline to data visualization.
Build data pipelines to support both internal and customer facing products, and collaborate with Product development teams to launch and measure success.
Work cross-functionally to build KPIs, and develop complex transformative analyses that help teams improve their processes, make product and business decisions.
Communicate insights and recommendations to a broader audience, include technical and non-technical stakeholders.


What we are looking for


3+ years of experience as an analyst
Interest in Freight Industry
Experience helping GTM teams (Marketing, Sales, RevOps, Growth) make better data-driven decisions
Strong working knowledge of SQL and experience with Business Intelligence tools (Looker, Heap, Amplitude)
Experience building and maintaining Marketing Attribution Models and measuring campaign performance. Alternatively, strong working experience with MMP tools (Mobile Measuring Partner tools, like Singular, Adjust, AppFlyer)
Experience working with Ad Network data
Experience working directly with Sales and RevOps teams, with strong familiarity with sales motions and sales KPIs
Strong working experience with CRM tools like Salesforce or HubSpot
Exposure to software engineering principles - version control, code reviews, unit testing.
Strong interpersonal skills and ability to work cross-functionally.
Experience working alongside both technical and non-technical teams.
Ability to communicate and influence both technical and non-technical audiences.
A natural curiosity and comfort trying new things that may not have existing playbooks.
An intrinsic drive to automate menial or low value tasks.

Experience working in Freight Operations or Logistics
Experience with Data Integration tools like Fivetran, Polytomic, Segment
Experience with Lifecycle Marketing tools like Marketo or Braze

Position Overview

4MATIV is a rapidly growing company with an increasingly broad portfolio of consulting clients. As our list of client districts and state education agencies grows, the need for a robust, productive, and knowledgeable team of analysts is increasingly important to our business.

Are you passionate about improving our environment for this generation and those to follow? Are you ready to take on new challenges and collaborate with a future-focused team leading the way into new markets? Join Nexamp! 

This is where you can learn from industry leaders and become one yourself. It's fast-paced, mission-based work that challenges the status quo. Be on the team that's changing the world. 

What we’re looking for: 

We're looking for a Lead Data Analyst to craft insightful and compelling data stories, empower business owners across Nexamp to make more effective data-driven decisions, and help build our self-service data platform. As one of the nation’s largest and longest tenured solar and storage owner operators – and one of the few that is fully vertically integrated – our data is a differentiator in the market and a catalyst for future growth. You’ll be solving uniquely challenging data problems, alongside a strong team, and for a company in which the business model and mission are inseparably intertwined: our solar farms save customers money, help the planet, and are profitable for Nexamp and its investors. 

This role will be hybrid, based out of our Boston office, and you will report to the Director of Product, Data.

What you’ll do:  

Own and Deliver Data Products: Independently gather requirements for, prioritize, deliver, maintain, and continuously improve reusable data models, dashboards, analyses, A/B tests, and other data assets. Act as the product manager and implementer for your domain’s data offerings. Implement work using advanced SQL and BI tool skills. 
Be a Trusted Data Partner: Become the subject matter expert for data in your business areas. Identify opportunities for impact, proactively surface insights, support decision-making, and contribute to and influence business strategy and initiatives. Serve as your business stakeholders’ right hand. Support other business areas opportunistically.
Drive Data Quality, Documentation, and Engineering: Create and maintain comprehensive data documentation and communicate updates to your stakeholders. Write user stories or tickets for data engineering, validate data mapping, conduct QA, and implement data quality monitoring.
Foster Data Culture and Adoption: Monitor the usage of data assets, increase data literacy, and promote self-service through BI tools among stakeholders. Provide training, guidance, and support as needed.  
Collaborate Across the Data Team: Work within a centralized data team using agile methodologies. Collaborate with peer analysts through overlapping work, priority shifting, and code reviews to broaden your Nexamp knowledge.
Influence Data Strategy: Partner with the data architect, engineers, scientists, and analysts to shape the vision and roadmap for Nexamp’s data platform. Define and track annual OKRs to measure your impact.  

What you’ll bring: 

5-7 years of experience as a data analyst serving business owners and collaborating with data engineers (experience in the energy/construction industry is a plus, but not required) 
Advanced in SQL and BI tool administration and usage (experience with Databricks and Sigma are a plus, but not required) 
Strong track record of independently solving problems.
Commitment to Nexamp's mission and have a passion for solving tomorrow's climate crisis today.
Demonstrated experience in effectively communicating information, ideas, and perspectives with people inside and beyond your organization.   
Experience in showcasing initiative to make improvements to current work, processes, products, and services across the organization. We value accountability and an ownership mentality. 
Ability to ask appropriate questions, analyze data, identify the root causes of problems, and present creative solutions. 
Expertise in building strong internal and external relationships with customers and stakeholders, instilling trust and loyalty across the industry. 
Eagerness to develop a fundamental understanding of how Nexamp operates and then apply that knowledge effectively to inform business decisions.  

If you don’t meet 100% of the above qualifications, but see yourself contributing, please apply.

At Nexamp, our mission is to build the future of energy so it is clean, simple, and accessible for all. We are committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, veteran status, or any other basis protected by law. By encouraging a culture where ideas and decisions come from all people, we believe it will help us grow, innovate, and be a part of environmental and social change.

You’ll love working here because:  

Not only will you get to take part in meaningful work and have the chance to change the world alongside innovative, dedicated, and motivated peers, but you will also have access to all the benefits that Nexamp offers! This includes our competitive compensation package; a 401(k) employer-match; health, dental, and vision insurance starting day one; flexible paid time off and holiday PTO; commuter benefits, and cell phone reimbursement. We have headquarters in Boston, MA and Chicago, IL, in addition to growing offices nationwide. We provide healthy snacks, coffee, service days and other volunteer opportunities, company outings, and more!  

Nexamp's People team manages all aspects of recruitment and hiring within our organization. We want to inform third-party recruiters, staffing firms, and related agencies that Nexamp does not accept unsolicited resumes. Resumes will only be considered from these entities if a signed agreement is in place and the People team explicitly authorizes external recruiting assistance for a specific position. Any unsolicited resumes received will be deemed the property of Nexamp. We want to emphasize that Nexamp is not liable for any fees associated with unsolicited resumes.
