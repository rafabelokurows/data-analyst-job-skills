Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Working remotely at Stripe

A remote location is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We’re looking for platform experts who thrive on structure, strategy, and solving.

We’re looking for a Social Listening & Insights Analyst who brings more than just monitoring skills—you bring the ability to uncover meaningful insights from complex social data and connect them to the bigger picture. Working within a large matrixed tech environment, you’ll help transform how we use social listening to inform business and marketing decisions across priority customer solution areas (CSAs).

You’ll support both planned and ad hoc reporting, contributing to a stronger insights-driven culture. This role is ideal for someone who’s both analytical and curious, with the drive to not just report on trends—but to ask better questions, spot patterns, and tell stories with data that shape strategy.

This person would join the Designit team that supports Microsoft Cloud Marketing, Blog, and Social. This world-class social team operates 100+ social media channels and 20+ marketing blogs designed for developers, IT decision makers, IT implementers, and business decision makers. Each month, we publish over 3,000 posts to help, inform, entertain, and engage across the globe. Azure, Power BI, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 are just a few examples of the innovative products and services that comprise the ecosystem.

What You’ll Do

Own and deliver recurring and ad hoc social listening reports across CSAs, tailored to specific campaign, brand, or business priorities.
Translate social data into clear, actionable insights that drive decisions—beyond just volume metrics.
Provide point-in-time analysis during key launches, events, or spikes in conversation.
Surface sentiment trends, audience behaviors, competitor comparisons, and whitespace opportunities.
Partner closely with social media managers, strategists, and ops leads to align reporting with campaign and business objectives.
Act as a thought partner—not just a report generator—by proactively identifying insight opportunities and storylines.
Help evolve our reporting frameworks, storytelling formats, and listening taxonomies over time.
Stay current on industry tools, best practices, and emerging technologies in the listening and analytics space.

What You’ll Bring

3–5+ years of experience in social listening, digital analytics, or insights—ideally in agency, tech, or global brand settings.
Hands-on expertise with social listening tools (Sprinklr highly preferred, or others like Talkwalker, Brandwatch, NetBase, etc.).
Strong data analysis and synthesis skills; comfort with interpreting both quantitative and qualitative social data.
Ability to craft clear insights and deliver them in visually engaging and executive-friendly ways.
A sense of curiosity—asking “why” behind the data and seeking broader patterns or implications.
Experience working across multiple stakeholders and managing multiple requests at once in a fast-paced environment.
Solid understanding of the social landscape—platform nuances, content formats, and conversation patterns.
Bonus: familiarity with tagging structures, taxonomy building, or integration with broader research teams.

Why This Role Is Exciting

Social data has never been more valuable—but it’s only as powerful as the insights we draw from it. In this role, you’ll help elevate the way our team listens, understands, and acts on what our audiences are saying. You’ll play a critical part in shaping strategy, guiding content, and keeping a pulse on what matters most across one of the world’s leading tech brands.







Compensation: $100000K - $110000K

Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.

Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.

Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1.4B+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.

We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.

About The Role

Rippling is building the future of how businesses run — and our Data Cloud team is on a mission to give every customer a full-stack data platform to understand and operate their business, across every function: HR, IT, Finance, and beyond.

We’re looking for a Data Analyst to join our product team — but this isn’t your typical analyst role. You won’t be sitting in a silo writing dashboards for exec reviews. Instead, you’ll be at the center of how we dogfood our own analytics products, solve real reporting needs for our internal teams (starting with HR), and translate those solutions into customer-facing templates, recipes, and product feedback.

If you’re the kind of person who’s happiest when you’re deep in SQL one minute, building dashboards the next, and collaborating with product managers to make tools better the minute after that — this is your role.

What You Will Do


Support internal reporting use cases: Be the go-to person for Rippling’s internal HR reporting needs — helping them define the right metrics, write the SQL, and build clean dashboards using our own reporting tools.
Productize real solutions: Take the reports and dashboards you build for internal teams and turn them into recipes or templates that any Rippling customer can use.
Shape the future of the product: Because you’ll be living in our product every day, you’ll become a key voice for what’s working and what’s not — surfacing gaps, proposing improvements, and even influencing the roadmap.
Be the “power user” of our data stack: Our team builds everything from ingestion to transformation to dashboards. You’ll be working across this full stack, helping make it more usable and scalable through your daily work.
Drive self-serve analytics adoption: Help internal teams (starting with HR) reduce their dependence on ad hoc requests by building the right dashboards and templates to unlock self-serve.


What Success Looks Like


Internal teams can get the reports they need faster — and without asking twice.
Your dashboards become models for how customers solve similar reporting problems.
Your feedback helps us make major product improvements.
We ship better data products because you’ve helped us dogfood our own tools thoroughly and thoughtfully.
You are seen as both a trusted reporting partner and a product-minded analyst who can bridge internal needs and customer-facing solutions.


What You Will Need


3+ years working with data.
Proficiency in SQL and hands-on experience with data exploration and dashboarding tools (Looker, Mode, Tableau, etc.).
A strong sense of product empathy — you don’t just solve the problem, you think about how others could solve it too.
Experience working with People, HR, or GTM teams is a plus.
Comfort navigating ambiguity, unstructured questions, and imperfect data.
Bonus: familiarity with dbt, analytics engineering, or data governance principles.


Why This Role Is Special

This role lives inside the product team, not on a siloed analytics team. That means:


Your work directly informs how we build and improve our data products.
You’re empowered to propose ideas, templates, and workflows based on real usage.
You get to see immediate impact — both internally and externally — from what you build.


This is a great fit for someone who wants to stay hands-on with data, but also get exposure to product development and influence what we ship.

Apply if…


You love using data to unlock clarity for others.
You get excited by operational reporting — not just vanity metrics.
You want to be part of a team building powerful tools and using them every day.
You’re curious, self-directed, and opinionated about what great looks like.

We are the Financial Enablement team under FinSys, acting as the centralized data analytics team for the Org, enabling and empowering teams to achieve business goals, through data analytics support, dashboards, tooling automation and operational efficiency enhancements.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities

This role is mainly designed to provide data analytics support for the GTM (go-to-market), F&S (Finance & Strategy) team, and internal FinSys Engineering team.

Your Responsibilities Include


Perform data analysis, identify trends, conduct research, build visualizations, all to deliver objective, critical insights that fulfill team stakeholders’ business needs

Work closely with cross-functional teams, including Accounting, User billing, Seller system teams, and Sales Ops, to align on financial goals and drive revenue growth
Reconcile internal revenue metrics across complex finance systems.
Coordinate cross-functional projects to identify and drive operational efficiencies that support our stakeholders ability to run more efficiently and effectively
Work closely with Engineering teams to help define product solutions
Conduct internal knowledge sharing sessions to strengthen team



Who you are

You’re passionate about solving business problems and making a direct impact on stakeholders. You are comfortable with dealing with many moving pieces, learning new technologies and systems, and you are excited about managing projects across multiple functions. This role gives you opportunities to work with data analysts, engineers, and business stakeholders directly in the US and India.

We're looking for someone who is self driven, has strong data analytics skills and great communication skills.

Minimum Requirements


Bachelor's degree in STEM major (i.e. Computer Science, Math, Stat, Engineering, etc.)
7+ years of prior working experience in data analysis fields
Strong analytical ability, proficiency with SQL (minimum of 4 years advanced SQL) and strong understanding of data relationships

Experience in creating dashboards to visualize system performance and KPI generation, with an understanding of metrics that clearly explain the data.
Experience working with teams in disparate time zones (i.e. US teams)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Working remotely at Stripe

A remote location is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $182,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Working remotely at Stripe

The User Operations team is central to ensuring that our customers' experience with our products is nothing short of exceptional. We resolve complex issues, provide technical guidance, and support customers in maximizing value and adoption from deploying our products. We work closely with Sales, Technical Success, Product, Engineering and others to deliver the best possible experience to our customers at scale. OpenAI's customers represent a range of diverse backgrounds and maturity, from early-stage startups to established global enterprises. Given OpenAI’s breakneck shipping cadence and growth—and the expectation that it will only accelerate—transforming our rich support data into real‑time insights and scalable, self‑serve analytics is critical to sustaining exceptional customer experiences on the path to AGI.

About The Role

We’re seeking a User Operations Data Analyst who will dig deep into user‑support data—surfacing trends, volumes, and friction signals—and turn these findings into actionable insights and always‑on reporting. You’ll design, build, and maintain self‑serve dashboards that keep every stakeholder informed in real time, partnering closely with Data Science and Engineering to ensure clean pipelines, robust models, and scalable tooling. Think proactive friction detection and real‑time service‑health views that help us stay ahead of demand—delivering decision‑grade insights, not just prettier slide decks.

This role is based in San Francisco, California. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In This Role, You Will


Explore large support and product datasets to uncover trends, volume drivers, and user‑experience pain points, distilling findings into clear, actionable narratives.
Build, enhance, and maintain self‑serve dashboards and reporting tools, enabling non‑technical teams to answer their own data questions.
Establish a unified metrics taxonomy for service‑health and performance—and build automated data‑sharing pipelines and scorecards with our BPO partners to ensure everyone operates from the same real‑time view of success
Leverage LLMs to build bespoke classifiers that automatically label and segment inbound volumes—powering smarter routing, richer self‑serve insights, and swifter root‑cause analysis.
Partner with Data Engineering to ensure reliable pipelines, implement data‑quality checks, and document sources of truth.
Jump into high‑priority special projects to conduct bespoke deep‑dive analyses and deliver clear, strategic recommendations to leadership.
Prototype quickly—leveraging ChatGPT, Jupyter notebooks, Retool, and other tools—to prove value before hardening with Engineering.
Collaborate with Data Science on predictive models and experimentation, translating results into operational recommendations.


You Might Thrive In This Role If You


8 + years in analytics, business intelligence, or data science, ideally supporting customer support or operations teams.
Expert‑level SQL skills and proficiency in Python or R for advanced analysis and automation
Hands‑on experience designing and maintaining BI dashboards (e.g. Looker, Mode, Tableau, Sundial) with a focus on clarity and self‑serve usability.
Hands‑on experience fine‑tuning or prompt‑engineering LLMs to build text classifiers, sentiment analysis, or tagging systems.
Demonstrated ability to translate complex datasets into clear business stories and recommendations for both technical and non‑technical audiences.
Familiarity with support metrics (SLAs, FCR, deflection) and ability to define service health KPIs.
Strong cross‑functional communication skills—comfortable collaborating daily with engineers, data scientists, and operations leaders.
An eye for detail, a zero‑defect mindset, and a bias toward action over theoretical perfection
Possess a strong bias for automation and can defend governance decisions that keep data and processes healthy as they grow.
Thrive in a fast‑moving, ambiguous environment where priorities can shift quickly.

From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world. If you're excited to shape the future of design and collaboration, join us!

We’re looking for a People Data Analyst to build thoughtful, scalable data tools that empower our People team with the insights they need to support every stage of the employee experience. You’ll take ownership of our people data tools to deliver automated reporting and intuitive dashboards that enable better decisions throughout the employee lifecycle. This is a builder role, ideal for someone who thrives on technical challenges, turning complex data into empowering tools, and digging beneath the surface to solve the real problem (not just deliver what's asked).

If you’re excited about building for scale and working alongside an amazing people team during a time of growing maturity, this role could be for you! We’ve spent the past few years implementing new systems and processes - now comes the fun part of bringing the data together to tell stories across the recruiting and employee lifecycles!

This is a full time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.

What you’ll do at Figma:


Develop and maintain dashboards and analytics tools across the employee lifecycle that equip the People team and business leaders with timely, actionable insights.
Use SQL to extract, clean, and organize data from multiple People systems—ensuring it is structured, accurate, and ready to power reporting, dashboards, and analytics products across the employee lifecycle.
Design, manage, and evolve a centralized metrics library that defines and standardizes key people metrics across the employee lifecycle, supporting consistent reporting and analysis.
Own and maintain the self-service reporting experience in platforms like OneModel and Tableau—ensuring stakeholders can access trusted, timely data across the employee lifecycle.
Create clear documentation, training, and enablement resources to support non-technical users in confidently navigating dashboards and making data-informed decisions.
Establish feedback loops with end users to continuously improve dashboard usability, identify reporting gaps, and ensure data products evolve with stakeholder needs.


We'd love to hear from you if you have:


Approximately 5 years of experience in HR or Recruiting, people analytics, or a related field, with exposure to People or Talent data.
Demonstrated experience with basic SQL and can independently write clean, efficient queries to manipulate fields and join data across systems
Familiarity with HR systems like Workday, Greenhouse, Gem, CultureAmp, or similar tools, and a willingness to deepen your understanding over time.
Experience working with a BI tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI), or a people analytics reporting tool (e.g., OneModel, Visier).
A builder’s mindset—you’re excited by the challenge of designing scalable solutions that reduce manual work and increase self-service.
A passion for clean, accurate, and reliable data, along with experience driving process improvements to enhance data quality.
Problem-first mindset with strong analytical curiosity— you go beyond surface-level requests to understand the true business need and deliver solutions that solve the right problem.
A collaborative working style, with the ability to partner across HR, Recruiting, L&D, and engineering teams to execute on a roadmap.


While not required, it’s an added plus if you also have:


Experience scaling OneModel in a high-growth environment.
Experience with report writing in Workday.

At Vizcom, we strive to be a powerful ally to designers, augmenting their skills and streamlining their workflow. Our innovative platform serves as a bridge between imagination and realization, enabling designers to bring their visions to life with unprecedented ease and precision. By combining the intuition of human creativity with the capabilities of artificial intelligence, Vizcom is shaping the future of design – one where technology amplifies rather than diminishes the designer's role.

The Role:

We’re seeking a Product Operations Data Analyst who will dig deep into user-support data, surfacing trends, volumes, and friction signals, and turning these findings into actionable insights and always-on reporting. You’ll design, build, and maintain self-serve dashboards that keep every stakeholder informed in real time. You will partner closely with Product, Sales and Engineering to ensure clean pipelines, robust models, and scalable tooling. The role focuses on proactive friction detection and real-time service-health views that help us stay ahead of demand, delivering decision-grade insights rather than just prettier slide decks.

Tldr: Explore large product datasets to uncover trends, volume drivers, and user‑experience pain points, distilling findings into clear, actionable narratives.

You will work closely with CEO Jordan Taylor, customers, understand their requirements, and prioritize improvements to the product.

How You’ll Do It:


Build, enhance, and maintain self‑serve dashboards and reporting tools, enabling non‑technical teams to answer their own data questions.
Establish a unified metrics taxonomy for service‑health and performance and build automated data‑sharing pipelines and scorecards to ensure everyone operates from the same real‑time view of success
Instrument and analyze model usage across Vizcom, surfacing adoption trends, feature-level engagement, and downstream product insights that inform roadmap decisions and guide continuous improvement.
Jump into high‑priority special projects to conduct bespoke deep‑dive analyses and deliver clear, strategic recommendations to leadership.
Prototype quickly leveraging ChatGPT, Jupyter notebooks, Retool, and other tools to prove value before hardening with Engineering.
Collaborate with Engineering on predictive models and experimentation, translating results into operational recommendations.


What You’ll Bring:


5 + years in analytics, business intelligence, or data science, ideally supporting customer support or operations teams.
Expert‑level SQL skills and proficiency in Python or R for advanced analysis and automation
Hands‑on experience designing and maintaining BI dashboards (e.g. Looker, Mode, Tableau, Sundial) with a focus on clarity and self-serve usability.
Demonstrated ability to translate complex datasets into clear business stories and recommendations for both technical and non‑technical audiences.
Familiarity with support metrics (SLAs, FCR, deflection) and ability to define service health KPIs.
Strong cross‑functional communication skills comfortable collaborating daily with engineers, data scientists, and operations leaders.
An eye for detail, a zero‑defect mindset, and a bias toward action over theoretical perfection
Possess a strong bias for automation and can defend governance decisions that keep data and processes healthy as they grow.
Handles priorities shifting quickly well.


Benefits While Working At Vizcom:


100% employer sponsored medical care for employees, 25% towards dependents
Dental, VIsion and Mental Health Care
Equity for all full-time, U.S.-based employees
Flexible PTO
Remote-first
401(k) with payroll match
Generous annual Learning & Development allowance
Paid parental leave


Compensation:

The base pay range targeted for this position is: $165,000 - $190,000 This role is eligible for equity.

This role is based in San Francisco, California. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

The actual offer, including the compensation package, is determined based on multiple factors, including experience, location, and other business considerations. The overall package described in this post applies to W2, U.S. based employees- final package will be determined by local requirements and employment laws and accessibility.


Please note, as part of our SOC2 Type 2 compliance, all employees are required to submit to a background check


Join Us and Make an Impact: At Vizcom, we move fast, offer meaningful equity ownership, and provide a compelling growth trajectory for our team members. We believe in the art of industrial design and strive to improve our world through accelerated visionary processes. Join us in shaping a world designed by you.

Demonstrated experience as a Data Analyst, preferably within the fintech industry, with a strong focus on crypto trading, payments, and brokerage services.
Proficiency in data analysis tools and programming languages such as SQL, Python, and R, along with proficiency in data visualization software (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).
Strong analytical skills and problem-solving capabilities, with a proven ability to convert complex data into actionable business insights.
Experience with creating business intelligence reports and ad-hoc analyses tailored to meet diverse client and regulatory requirements.
Experience working in Agile environments.
Proven ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams, including product management, engineering, and support.

Through its robust suite of tools, Realtor.com® not only makes a significant impact on the real estate industry at large, but for consumers, navigating the biggest purchase they will make in their life, by providing a user experience that is easy to use, easy to understand, and most of all, easy to make decisions.

Data Analyst, Client Product Analytics

About http://Realtor.com :

At http://realtor.com , we have the most comprehensive and accurate coverage of real estate listings and the most engaged users across all the online real estate portals. Our mission is to make buying, selling, renting, and living in homes easier and more rewarding for everyone.

The Data Science and Analytics organization at http://realtor.com sits at the heart of this mission. We process and analyze terabytes of data every day that enable decisions for millions of home buyers, sellers, renters, dreamers, and real estate professionals. Our goal is to use this data to make the home buying experience a breeze for our consumers. We empower them with the most up-to-date information on properties, help them find their dream homes in the least amount of time, and match them with the most suitable realtor to meet their unique, individual needs.

Role Description:

We are looking for the best data and analytical minds to help us measure the effectiveness of our products that aim to make it simple and easy to buy and sell a home. To accomplish that task, we are looking for a Senior Data Analyst with a consumer services, business, or technology background to join our expanding Product Analytics team within the Enterprise Data Science and Analytics organization. The team you are joining acts as a “trusted” partner to our key product stakeholders helping them answer their most critical business questions. This could be accomplished by conducting strategic deep insight analysis, A/B experimentation design and measurement, or creating new innovative ways to measure the success of the business. This is a job for someone who not only possesses strong technical skills, but also the ability to take data and mold it into a cohesive story that enables our stakeholders to make informed business decisions. Ideal candidates will be comfortable presenting their findings to stakeholders.

We are looking for a Data Analyst III to join our Product Analytics team within the Data Science & Analytics organization with the goal of helping the extended product team evaluate the launch of new features aimed at accelerating the growth of our ecommerce sales channel, the Online Store.

The mission of the Product Analytics team is to be very strategic and pivotal to ensure that the company stays on course with meeting key OKRs (Objective and Key Results). This is not a traditional reporting role - a successful candidate will be able to take large amounts of data and be able to surface the “why” around data movements - not just the “what”

Responsibilities:

Business Performance Reporting, Visualization and Analysis: Be the primary partner for our cross-functional stakeholders to understand product performance. When a metric is ahead or behind expectations, dig in to drive meaningful, actionable insights that help the business performance improve or double-down on success.
Deep-Dive Analysis: Use advanced techniques (A/B experimentation, statistical modeling, matched pair, and/or machine learning) to analyze consumer product performance at a lead and feature level.  Create a rich understanding of how people are interacting with product features and use these insights to then make recommendations.
Opportunity Identification and Sizing: Both to set goals and help evaluate potential product enrichment  opportunities, you will be tasked with forecasting and opportunity sizing. This will help our Product stakeholders understand the short-run and long-run dynamics of proposed changes to our product strategy, and create targets for driving business performance as well as optimize lead generation and funnel improvement opportunities.
Partnership and Communication: Partner closely with our Product stakeholders to identify and unlock opportunities, and with other data teams to improve platform capabilities around data architecture, data visualization, data modeling, and testing platforms.
Build trust in all interactions and with Enterprise Consumer Data Mart and be an advocate for adoption
Be responsible for monitoring the success of visitors' engagement and conversion by tracking metrics and building new estimated KPIs if necessary (e.g., product usage metrics)
Build relationships with other products and analytics teams to share best practices and enrich analytic practices
Conduct quantitative analysis, ad hoc reports, & statistical models to understand the health and latest trends among product engagement and funnel conversion consumer metrics
Create impactful data insights and analysis from Analytic Plan creation thru End-of-Analysis summaries

Requirements:

Bachelor's Degree in Business Analytics, Math, Economics
2-5+ years of work experience analyzing data to answer business questions
Experience using data to analyze product feature performance is preferred
Experience in a consumer subscription business also relevant
Advanced knowledge in SQL and knowledge in Python or R a plus
Experience with digital analytics platforms like Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics is preferred
Experience with data exploration and data visualization tools such as Tableau, Shiny, Streamlit, etc.
Experience with cloud-based data environments such as AWS and Snowflake
Advanced technical and modeling skills including Excel or Google Sheet skills (e.g. pivot, vlookup, etc.) and data analytics 
Understanding of experimentation and statistics concepts (e.g. confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, etc.)
Ability to think strategically, analyze and interpret product performance drivers as well as how analyze a conversion funnel with key fallout points identified
Intense curiosity, high intellectual and analytical horsepower, passionate pursuit of analytics driven insights
Strong communication skills as well as written and verbal presentation skills and experience presenting to diverse audiences
Ability to thrive in a largely remote organization
Comfort working in a highly agile, intensely iterative environment
Self-motivated and self-managing, with strong time management and organizational skills

Mindful movement. It’s at the core of why we do what we do at ALO—it’s our calling. Because mindful movement in the studio leads to better living. It changes who yogis are off the mat, making their lives and their communities better. That’s the real meaning of studio-to-street: taking the consciousness from practice on the mat and putting it into practice in life.

OVERVIEW

We are seeking a Lead Data Analyst with a sharp strategic mindset, and a passion for turning data into business impact. This role goes beyond traditional analytics—you're not just crunching numbers; you're actively shaping the business. Acting as a close partner to the team leader, you’ll serve as both a thought leader and execution driver, helping translate complex data into persuasive narratives and strategic action. You’ll independently engage with cross-functional business stakeholders, influence high-impact decisions, and help build a scalable analytics function. You’ll also manage junior team members and contribute to AI-driven initiatives, empowering the business with smarter, faster insights. If you're a proactive, influential communicator who thrives at the intersection of business, data, and AI innovation, this is the role for you.

RESPONSIBILITIES


Partner directly with business stakeholders at all levels to define success metrics, lead strategic analyses, and guide decision-making across e-commerce, retail, marketing, and customer strategy.
Translate complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive growth and operational efficiency.
Design and lead high-impact A/B and multivariate tests.
Build and scale dashboards and automated reporting to enable data democratization.
Ensure data quality and partner with Data Engineering to validate end-to-end data implementation, from tracking to reporting.
Collaborate with AI and data science teams to integrate AI tools (e.g., LLMs, recommendation engines) into business workflows and decision support systems.
Leverage generative AI tools to accelerate insight generation, automate repetitive analysis, and enhance stakeholder communication.
Mentor junior analysts and foster a high-performance culture through best practices and coaching.
Support as the analytical right hand to the Senior Director of Analytics, helping prioritize and drive high-value data initiatives across the company.


QUALIFICATIONS


7–8 years of professional experience in data analytics, with a track record of using insights to shape business strategy in high-growth e-commerce or digitally enabled retail environments.
Minimum of 2 years of professional experience managing and developing junior team members.
Strong e-commerce domain expertise, including digital funnel optimization, omnichannel performance, customer segmentation, and merchandising analytics.
Strong business acumen and executive presence, with the ability to influence senior stakeholders through data storytelling.
Advanced SQL and proficiency in Python or R; strong grasp of experimentation design, statistics, and data modeling.
Proficiency in BI tools like Tableau or Thoughtspot; able to build scalable, intuitive dashboards from the ground up.
Experience collaborating with Data Science teams to build, deploy, and evaluate predictive models (e.g., forecasting, churn, LTV).
Familiarity with AI/ML applications in analytics, including generative AI (e.g., prompt engineering, LLMs), and AI-based tools for business decision support.
Self-starter with excellent communication and prioritization skills; comfortable managing projects with ambiguity and shifting priorities.


The base salary range for this position is $170,000-$190,000 per year which represents the current range for the base salary for this exempt position. Please note that actual salaries will vary based on factors including but not limited to location, experience, and performance.

Want to make an impact? Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.




We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.




Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, we work closely with our teams in Barcelona, San Antonio, Spokane, and remote locations. We’ve got a reputation for being a great place to work, having been named among the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Seattle Business Magazine and Washington’s Best Workplaces in the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies.




At Rover, our furry coworkers are just as important as our human ones—and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Along with making the joys of pet parenthood more accessible, we’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community of pet people—and that starts with our employees.




Who we're looking for:

The Marketing Analytics team supports the company’s marketing efforts, while also working with teams throughout the organization. The analytics team is responsible for a number of business-critical reports and data models that our global marketing teams rely on for daily reporting, budgeting, and analysis. We measure marketing attribution to understand how people become Rover customers, provide campaign reporting to monitor trends in cost efficiency and optimization, deliver lifecycle data to action against a variety of customer behaviors, and narrate the business to identify and prioritize new opportunities.




We are looking for an Analyst to support our Growth, International Expansion, Lifecycle, and SEO stakeholders with a focus on improving our reporting and dashboard structure. The ideal candidate will have experience working closely with business stakeholders and building data-driven narratives that enable clear decision making.




*This is a hybrid position that has the minimum expectation to work out of our Barcelona Office in the Poblenou neighborhood two days per week on Mondays and Thursdays. For this reason, candidates must be based in Barcelona or willing to relocate.




Your Responsibilities:

Work closely with analytics peers and marketing teams to narrate trends and insights, with a particular focus on our customer acquisition marketing programs.
Design reports and dashboards that enable clear, data-driven decision-making for marketing and cross-functional teams.
Refine our marketing attribution models to drive optimal resource allocation across paid and organic marketing channels.
Expand your expertise by supporting experiments such as A/B testing and Market Match tests to optimize strategies across multiple marketing functions.




Your Qualifications:

At least 2 years experience working with complex datasets to support business decision making.
Fluency in SQL.
Data visualisation tool experience (e.g. Mode, Looker, Tableau, etc.)
Ability to adapt your communication style to translate complex data insights for different audiences.
You have experience in owning small-to-medium projects from design to completion with limited guidance from your manager.
You understand when you are blocked, proactively seeking out for help within the team or the organization to move the project forward.




Nice to Have:

Python or R familiarity is helpful, but we welcome candidates eager to develop these skills.
Experience evaluating results of A/B tests as well as expertise in statistical analysis.
Understanding of marketing metrics such as clicks, CPC, CTR, impressions, and unit economics like customer LTV, payback period, and CAC.




Benefits of working at Rover:

Competitive compensation
Long-term incentive plan with a company performance-based cash payout
Permanent contract
Pension plan
Meal tickets through Cobee
Generous PTO allowance
Private health insurance
Discounted gym membership
Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time)
Monetary help for adopting a dog or cat plus yearly credit to use on our platform
A wide variety of snacks, fresh fruit, and beverages in our kitchen to keep yourself going
Regular team activities, including happy hours, game nights, and more

Máš rád/a čísla, ale nechceš být jen „ten člověk s Excel tabulkou“? Přidej se k nám a pojď s námi hledat způsoby, jak dělat věci chytřeji – pomocí dat, spolupráce a inovací.




O čem tahle role je?




Budeš pracovat v týmu Commercial, který pomáhá firmě růst chytře – ne jen „víc prodávat“, ale hlavně investovat tam, kde to fakt dává smysl.
Budeš analyzovat, co funguje (a co ne), hledat cesty, jak dělat pricing a promoční aktivity efektivněji, a srozumitelně vysvětlovat svoje závěry a doporučení kolegům z obchodu a marketingu.
Část práce bude pravidelná (weekly/monthly/quarterly reporty, přehledy), část hodně různorodá (ad-hoc analýzy, práce na projektech zlepšování procesů, implementace nových nástrojů etc).
Práce s Excelem a Power BI.




Koho hledáme?




Zájem o data a analytické myšlení – hledáme někoho, koho baví objevovat, co se skrývá za čísly.
Excel na pokročilé úrovni (min. pivotky, pokročilé funkce, ideálně i makra).
Zkušenost s Power BI či obdobným nástrojem je super (ale když nemáš, naučíme tě).
Chuť mluvit s lidmi – často budeš zjišťovat, co kolegové potřebují, a pomáhat jim dělat lepší rozhodnutí.
Angličtinu na úrovni, kdy zvládneš napsat e-mail nebo odprezentovat jednoduchý výstup i expatům (min B2).
A hlavně: otevřený mindset, odvahu zkoušet nové věci a chuť posouvat věci dopředu.




Proč pracovat právě s námi?

Práce, která má smysl – uvidíš dopad toho, co děláš, a pomůžeš firmě chytře růst.
Možnost růst spolu s námi – naučíš se toho fakt hodně o prodejních procesech, zákaznících i strategii.
Fajn tým, kde se nebojíme ptát, sdílet nápady a zkoušet nové věci. Role reportuje RGM manažerovi a komunikuje i s top managementem.
Flexibilní prostředí, kde můžeš přicházet s vlastními zlepšováky.
Značky, které mají jméno, a firemní kultura, která vám dá prostor zazářit.
Osobní i profesní rozvoj – talentové programy, školení a rozvojové aktivity. + e-learning platforma
Široká škála benefitů:
5 týdnů dovolené + 2 flexi days
Fasování: produkty zdarma (3 balení měsíčně) + zvýhodněný nákup firemních produktů a merche
Flexibilní benefity (Multisport karta, Kafeterie)
Příspěvek na penzijní připojištění nebo dlouhodobý investiční produkt
Stravování v kantýně nebo příspěvek na stravu.
Zvýhodněné volání pro rodinu (tarif: 5 simkaret) + výhodné vedení bankovního účtu
Možnost koupit zaměstnanecké akcie
Notebook, mobilní telefon

Du unterstützt unser Team bei Projekt-Aufgaben und im Tagesgeschäft im IT-Umfeld.
Viel von dem, was wir tun bedeutet Change, daher werden deine Aufgaben erstaunlich wenig IT-typisch sein.
Deine Aufgaben sind abwechslungsreich und umfassen die Recherche und Aufbereitung von Informationen, das Erstellen von internen Kommunikationsmitteln wie Blogbeiträgen und Newslettern, das Erstellen und Überarbeiten von Präsentationen und Schulungsmaterial, Support bei Veranstaltungen, Pflege von Intranetinhalten und Dokumentationen .
Du bist ein wichtiger Teil unseres Teams und erlebst eine Kommunikationskultur, in der ein offener Austausch gelebt wird und in der sich alle Teilnehmenden auf Augenhöhe begegnen.
Dank der Kombination aus Remote-Work und unserer Präsenz im wunderschönen Rheinauhafen, wo wir mittwochs und donnerstags zusammenarbeiten, kannst du deine Arbeitszeiten optimal mit deinem Studium vereinbaren.




Profil


Du studierst in einem passenden Bereich, der dich in unserem IT-lastigen Bereich und/oder im Thema Change/Kommunikation sicher macht und bist bereit, dir fehlendes Wissen anzueignen .
Du hast keine Scheu davor, dich in (technische) komplexe Zusammenhänge reinzufuchsen und kannst sie anderen vermitteln .

Are you passionate about improving our environment for this generation and those to follow? Are you ready to take on new challenges and collaborate with a future-focused team leading the way into new markets? Join Nexamp! 

This is where you can learn from industry leaders and become one yourself. It's fast-paced, mission-based work that challenges the status quo. Be on the team that's changing the world. 

What we’re looking for: 

We're looking for a Lead Data Analyst to craft insightful and compelling data stories, empower business owners across Nexamp to make more effective data-driven decisions, and help build our self-service data platform. As one of the nation’s largest and longest tenured solar and storage owner operators – and one of the few that is fully vertically integrated – our data is a differentiator in the market and a catalyst for future growth. You’ll be solving uniquely challenging data problems, alongside a strong team, and for a company in which the business model and mission are inseparably intertwined: our solar farms save customers money, help the planet, and are profitable for Nexamp and its investors. 

This role will be hybrid, based out of our Boston office, and you will report to the Director of Product, Data.

What you’ll do:  

Own and Deliver Data Products: Independently gather requirements for, prioritize, deliver, maintain, and continuously improve reusable data models, dashboards, analyses, A/B tests, and other data assets. Act as the product manager and implementer for your domain’s data offerings. Implement work using advanced SQL and BI tool skills. 
Be a Trusted Data Partner: Become the subject matter expert for data in your business areas. Identify opportunities for impact, proactively surface insights, support decision-making, and contribute to and influence business strategy and initiatives. Serve as your business stakeholders’ right hand. Support other business areas opportunistically.
Drive Data Quality, Documentation, and Engineering: Create and maintain comprehensive data documentation and communicate updates to your stakeholders. Write user stories or tickets for data engineering, validate data mapping, conduct QA, and implement data quality monitoring.
Foster Data Culture and Adoption: Monitor the usage of data assets, increase data literacy, and promote self-service through BI tools among stakeholders. Provide training, guidance, and support as needed.  
Collaborate Across the Data Team: Work within a centralized data team using agile methodologies. Collaborate with peer analysts through overlapping work, priority shifting, and code reviews to broaden your Nexamp knowledge.
Influence Data Strategy: Partner with the data architect, engineers, scientists, and analysts to shape the vision and roadmap for Nexamp’s data platform. Define and track annual OKRs to measure your impact.  

What you’ll bring: 

5-7 years of experience as a data analyst serving business owners and collaborating with data engineers (experience in the energy/construction industry is a plus, but not required) 
Advanced in SQL and BI tool administration and usage (experience with Databricks and Sigma are a plus, but not required) 
Strong track record of independently solving problems.
Commitment to Nexamp's mission and have a passion for solving tomorrow's climate crisis today.
Demonstrated experience in effectively communicating information, ideas, and perspectives with people inside and beyond your organization.   
Experience in showcasing initiative to make improvements to current work, processes, products, and services across the organization. We value accountability and an ownership mentality. 
Ability to ask appropriate questions, analyze data, identify the root causes of problems, and present creative solutions. 
Expertise in building strong internal and external relationships with customers and stakeholders, instilling trust and loyalty across the industry. 
Eagerness to develop a fundamental understanding of how Nexamp operates and then apply that knowledge effectively to inform business decisions.  

If you don’t meet 100% of the above qualifications, but see yourself contributing, please apply.

At Nexamp, our mission is to build the future of energy so it is clean, simple, and accessible for all. We are committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination.

You’ll love working here because:

This includes our competitive compensation package; a 401(k) employer-match; health, dental, and vision insurance starting day one; flexible paid time off and holiday PTO; commuter benefits, and cell phone reimbursement. We have headquarters in Boston, MA and Chicago, IL, in addition to growing offices nationwide. We provide healthy snacks, coffee, service days and other volunteer opportunities, company outings, and more!
