Deep Dive & Exploratory Analysis: Conduct complex, end-to-end exploratory analyses on large-scale user behavior data (transactional, clickstream, etc.) to uncover non-obvious insights, identify root causes of trends, and directly inform product strategy and roadmap development.
Technical & Mentorship Leadership: Contribute significantly to the growth and development of fellow product analysts through knowledge sharing sessions, best practice dissemination, workflow optimizations, and active participation in hiring and onboarding processes. Champion and drive analytical excellence within the team and broader organization.

About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We‚Äôre not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We‚Äôre a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare‚Äôs enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here‚Äôs the deal - we don‚Äôt store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Sound like something you‚Äôd like to be a part of? We‚Äôd love to hear from you!

Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements

Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders

Citylitics delivers predictive intelligence on local utility & public infrastructure markets.

What is Infrastructure? It is the roadways you rely on to safely get to Grandma's house, it's the potable water that comes out of your kitchen tap that you wash your family's food with and it's the energy that heats our homes and powers our digital lifestyles.

Every year, trillions of dollars are spent on all areas of infrastructure to maintain our quality life and move our economy forward. However, our infrastructure is no longer equipped to meet the needs of the future. We hear about infrastructure failures, whether bridge collapses, power blackouts, or water main breaks, every day in the news. Climate change and extreme weather events are disrupting the basic infrastructure we took for granted for years.

Citylitics is solving the hardest data problems in infrastructure while building the sales intelligence platform that enables a faster, more transparent, and more efficient infrastructure marketplace. We turn millions of unstructured documents into high value intelligence feeds and datasets that are available on an intuitive user experience. Our goal is to enable solution providers to connect with cities with relevant infrastructure needs in a faster and more digital way than historic market channels. As more companies adopt our platform, cities & utilities will be able to access solutions that deliver on the promise of moving towards a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable infrastructure future.

Who Are We Looking For?

We're looking for a Data Systems Manager to join our team in Toronto. The ideal candidate has a background in software development, product management, or project management, and a strong interest in structuring data. This isn't a formal Information Architecture role, but you will be responsible for creating order from the raw data signals we receive, designing the schemas, tables, and data models that will serve as the foundation for our AI tools and insights.

You'll report to our CPO and work with multiple teams including Product, Data Operations, Platform Dev, and Data Engineering. This is a unique opportunity to apply your expertise to help our teams build faster and more impactful products with our data.

The position will be out of our Toronto Headquarters.

What Will You Accomplish?


Design and Implement Data Structures: Analyze raw data inputs to identify patterns and relationships. You will design and document data schemas, tables, and data models that make sense to implement in our data warehouse
Drive Data Strategy: Develop and implement a data architecture strategy that aligns with our business goals. Define ontologies, metadata schemas, and classification standards to improve data discovery and usability
Manage Projects: Take ownership of data structuring projects from analysis to implementation. We are looking for someone with experience managing their own projects or with previous solo projects as a developer. You will need to be able to work with a high degree of autonomy and deliver independent reports after analysis sprints
Collaborate and Advise: Work with cross-functional teams to ensure our data systems support strategic decision-making and usability. You will provide strategic recommendations and document approaches and suggestions
Other duties as assigned


Requirements


Experience: 2-4 years of experience in data systems development, project management, product management, or a related field with a focus on data structuring. You have a background in data-driven projects within software, tech, or consulting
Skills: Strong understanding of data structures and algorithms, schema design, and database principles. You are passionate about seeing the potential structure through raw data noise
Technical Acumen: Proficiency with visualizing tools to share your designs and associations is a nice-to-have, as is familiarity with languages like SQL, Python, or BQML


Qualities: We need someone with curiosity, strong organizational skills, and an interest in working with unknowns and frontiers that have not been fully fleshed out. You should be detail-oriented and have the ability to work independently with high autonomy.

Benefits

Why Citylitics?


This is a rare opportunity to influence positive change within one of the biggest societal challenges of our generation: sustainable public infrastructure
You get to support a disruptive solution with a compelling value proposition into an industry that is eager to hear from you and in a market with no direct competition
We live at the cross section of infrastructure, scaleup and data science/AI. There is no other team like us in Toronto
There is no corporate bureaucracy here. You will accomplish more here in a few months than what you would in a few years at a large, entrenched technology company
We believe that Data and AI will play an outsized role in our future, so we equip every team member with access to Generative AI tools and our full Data Universe to enhance their productivity and encourage innovation through experimentation
We are proud to offer every CityZen an internal mentorship program, in-role professional growth, skill-based development & learning, and internal promotion opportunities
We work hard, we play together, we win as a team! We are on a mission to solve infrastructure while savoring the moment and celebrating the little details along the way


Citylitics is an equal opportunity employer. We are passionate about providing a safe workplace where everyone is accepted and has the opportunity to grow with us. We are committed to making diversity and inclusivity part of our culture!

Experience working with Salesforce or other CRM tools




Our commitment to our Shifties:

Opportunity: Our product is evolving in exciting ways, and we‚Äôre focused on delivering even more value to restaurants. This momentum creates real opportunities to learn and grow. Whether you‚Äôre honing your craft or exploring new paths, you‚Äôll be supported and empowered to own your growth and impact a product shaping the future of the restaurant industry.
Challenge: We‚Äôre tackling real problems in a fast-moving, complex industry. The work is scrappy and ambiguous, but meaningful. You‚Äôll think critically, act with intention, and shape solutions that make a real difference for restaurant teams.
Culture: We‚Äôre proud to be recognized among the best workplaces in North America. Guided by our mission and values, we move fast to solve meaningful problems and celebrate wins together. Whether through in-office and remote events, team offsites like Sparks, or everyday moments of connection, we create space for shared growth, collaboration, and fun.
Equity: We‚Äôre a Series C, VC-backed SaaS company, and we believe everyone should share in the success they help create. When we build together, we grow together.
Health and Wellness: We support Shifties in and outside of work, knowing that what people need can change over time. From day one, you‚Äôll have access to benefits like health and dental, lifestyle spending accounts to a parental leave program built with flexibility in mind, to help you bring your best self to work.
Flexibility: Our team is intentional around how and where we work, whether remotely, in person, or a mix of both. We prioritize candidates who thrive in a hybrid work environment with offices in Saskatoon and Toronto, ensuring in-person collaboration and connection when possible. Plus, we offer a flexible vacation policy to encourage everyone to recharge when needed. Oh, and our ‚Äò90 Day Shift‚Äô program lets Shift work from (almost) anywhere because who wouldn‚Äôt want to trade their desk for a beach view once in a while?
Support: We set Shifties up for success with the tools they need, like the latest Apple tech, a home office setup, and some 7shifts swag to make it official. But support goes beyond day one. We‚Äôre serious about professional growth, offering coaching, feedback, development planning, and opportunities to grow from within.




We know you might not check every box, and that‚Äôs okay. If you‚Äôre excited about this role, inspired to contribute to a meaningful product, and eager to share ideas that drive real change, we‚Äôd love to hear from you. We‚Äôre building an inclusive team that reflects the diverse industry we serve, and we welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

Citylitics delivers predictive intelligence on local utility & public infrastructure markets.

What is Infrastructure? It is the roadways you rely on to safely get to Grandma's house, it's the potable water that comes out of your kitchen tap that you wash your family's food with and it's the energy that heats our homes and powers our digital lifestyles.

Every year, trillions of dollars are spent on all areas of infrastructure to maintain our quality life and move our economy forward. However, our infrastructure is no longer equipped to meet the needs of the future. We hear about infrastructure failures, whether bridge collapses, power blackouts, or water main breaks, every day in the news. Climate change and extreme weather events are disrupting the basic infrastructure we took for granted for years.

Citylitics is solving the hardest data problems in infrastructure while building the sales intelligence platform that enables a faster, more transparent, and more efficient infrastructure marketplace. We turn millions of unstructured documents into high value intelligence feeds and datasets that are available on an intuitive user experience. Our goal is to enable solution providers to connect with cities with relevant infrastructure needs in a faster and more digital way than historic market channels. As more companies adopt our platform, cities & utilities will be able to access solutions that deliver on the promise of moving towards a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable infrastructure future.

We're seeking a proactive Data Quality Analyst who takes initiative and possesses a balanced blend of technical skills and a business mindset focused on delivering real customer value. You're passionate about public infrastructure and innovative technologies, and you bring an analytical approach with exceptional attention to detail, capable of discerning correlation from causation. We value out-of-the-box thinkers with an appetite for exploring new tools and approaches to solve problems, someone comfortable navigating the unknown and finding answers to open-ended questions. If you're action-biased, comfortable working with ambiguity, willing to explore various approaches to find what works, and you embrace collaboration, transparency, and openness, you'll thrive in this role.

What Will You Accomplish?


Provide insights into the quality of Citylitics data, including causes of data issues, explanations of anomalies, and approaches to remedy data inaccuracies
Leverage your understanding of existing data pipelines to propose opportunities for improvement in data collection, coverage and comprehensiveness
Uphold the integrity of our data sources by proactively identifying root causes of data quality issues and developing resolution plans that mitigate downstream impacts
Collaborate with customer-facing teams in investigating incoming data quality requests, then developing and implementing resolution plans that deliver customer value and satisfaction
Collaborate with backend teams on projects centered around improving quality processes, including data retrieval, enrichment, and labeling
Participate in discussions with internal and external (client) stakeholders to understand needs and inform decisions related to data quality
Communicate findings through concise summary reports and storytelling decks for a range of audiences, incorporating a combination of both technical and plain language as well as visualizations where required
Inform the Citylitics data roadmap and contribute to both the planning and execution of expansion projects to grow our data universe
Other duties as assigned


Requirements

Must haves


Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or Data Analytics. A background in a relevant field such as Environmental Science or Urban Planning will also be considered
2 to 4 years of experience in a data analysis or data modelling role
Advanced skills in Microsoft Excel and SQL with experience using data warehousing tools like BigQuery, Snowflake, etc
Exceptional attention to detail with an ability to identify inconsistencies in data and distinguish anomalies from regular patterns or trends
Experience with identifying opportunities for process improvements (i.e. automated workflows)
Strong visual, written and verbal communication skills including summarizing and presenting technical information to non-technical audiences
Experience collaborating with internal and/or external stakeholders to uncover data-related challenges and develop impactful, scalable solutions
Ability to manage competing priorities and deadlines


Nice to haves


Familiarity with data visualization tools such as Looker Studio, Tableau, Plot.ly Dash, etc
Exposure to data governance, cataloging, and lineage practices
Experience with unstructured datasets and/or qualitative analytics
Previous consulting or client-facing experience
Previous experience in the public sector or municipal infrastructure industry


Benefits

Why Citylitics?


This is a rare opportunity to influence positive change within one of the biggest societal challenges of our generation: sustainable public infrastructure
You get to support a disruptive solution with a compelling value proposition into an industry that is eager to hear from you and in a market with no direct competition
We live at the cross section of infrastructure, scaleup and data science/AI. There is no other team like us in Toronto

We are proud to offer every CityZen an internal mentorship program, in-role professional growth, skill-based development & learning, and internal promotion opportunities
We work hard, we play together, we win as a team! We are on a mission to solve infrastructure while savoring the moment and celebrating the little details along the way
