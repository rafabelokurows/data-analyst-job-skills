That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Working remotely at Stripe

A remote location is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Working remotely at Stripe

A remote location is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $182,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.

Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.

Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1.4B+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.

We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.

About The Role

Rippling is building the future of how businesses run — and our Data Cloud team is on a mission to give every customer a full-stack data platform to understand and operate their business, across every function: HR, IT, Finance, and beyond.

We’re looking for a Data Analyst to join our product team — but this isn’t your typical analyst role. You won’t be sitting in a silo writing dashboards for exec reviews. Instead, you’ll be at the center of how we dogfood our own analytics products, solve real reporting needs for our internal teams (starting with HR), and translate those solutions into customer-facing templates, recipes, and product feedback.

If you’re the kind of person who’s happiest when you’re deep in SQL one minute, building dashboards the next, and collaborating with product managers to make tools better the minute after that — this is your role.

What You Will Do


Support internal reporting use cases: Be the go-to person for Rippling’s internal HR reporting needs — helping them define the right metrics, write the SQL, and build clean dashboards using our own reporting tools.
Productize real solutions: Take the reports and dashboards you build for internal teams and turn them into recipes or templates that any Rippling customer can use.
Shape the future of the product: Because you’ll be living in our product every day, you’ll become a key voice for what’s working and what’s not — surfacing gaps, proposing improvements, and even influencing the roadmap.
Be the “power user” of our data stack: Our team builds everything from ingestion to transformation to dashboards. You’ll be working across this full stack, helping make it more usable and scalable through your daily work.
Drive self-serve analytics adoption: Help internal teams (starting with HR) reduce their dependence on ad hoc requests by building the right dashboards and templates to unlock self-serve.


What Success Looks Like


Internal teams can get the reports they need faster — and without asking twice.
Your dashboards become models for how customers solve similar reporting problems.
Your feedback helps us make major product improvements.
We ship better data products because you’ve helped us dogfood our own tools thoroughly and thoughtfully.
You are seen as both a trusted reporting partner and a product-minded analyst who can bridge internal needs and customer-facing solutions.


What You Will Need


3+ years working with data.
Proficiency in SQL and hands-on experience with data exploration and dashboarding tools (Looker, Mode, Tableau, etc.).
A strong sense of product empathy — you don’t just solve the problem, you think about how others could solve it too.
Experience working with People, HR, or GTM teams is a plus.
Comfort navigating ambiguity, unstructured questions, and imperfect data.
Bonus: familiarity with dbt, analytics engineering, or data governance principles.


Why This Role Is Special

This role lives inside the product team, not on a siloed analytics team. That means:


Your work directly informs how we build and improve our data products.
You’re empowered to propose ideas, templates, and workflows based on real usage.
You get to see immediate impact — both internally and externally — from what you build.


This is a great fit for someone who wants to stay hands-on with data, but also get exposure to product development and influence what we ship.

Apply if…


You love using data to unlock clarity for others.
You get excited by operational reporting — not just vanity metrics.
You want to be part of a team building powerful tools and using them every day.
You’re curious, self-directed, and opinionated about what great looks like.

The User Operations team is central to ensuring that our customers' experience with our products is nothing short of exceptional. We resolve complex issues, provide technical guidance, and support customers in maximizing value and adoption from deploying our products. We work closely with Sales, Technical Success, Product, Engineering and others to deliver the best possible experience to our customers at scale. OpenAI's customers represent a range of diverse backgrounds and maturity, from early-stage startups to established global enterprises. Given OpenAI’s breakneck shipping cadence and growth—and the expectation that it will only accelerate—transforming our rich support data into real‑time insights and scalable, self‑serve analytics is critical to sustaining exceptional customer experiences on the path to AGI.

About The Role

We’re seeking a User Operations Data Analyst who will dig deep into user‑support data—surfacing trends, volumes, and friction signals—and turn these findings into actionable insights and always‑on reporting. You’ll design, build, and maintain self‑serve dashboards that keep every stakeholder informed in real time, partnering closely with Data Science and Engineering to ensure clean pipelines, robust models, and scalable tooling. Think proactive friction detection and real‑time service‑health views that help us stay ahead of demand—delivering decision‑grade insights, not just prettier slide decks.

This role is based in San Francisco, California. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In This Role, You Will


Explore large support and product datasets to uncover trends, volume drivers, and user‑experience pain points, distilling findings into clear, actionable narratives.
Build, enhance, and maintain self‑serve dashboards and reporting tools, enabling non‑technical teams to answer their own data questions.
Establish a unified metrics taxonomy for service‑health and performance—and build automated data‑sharing pipelines and scorecards with our BPO partners to ensure everyone operates from the same real‑time view of success
Leverage LLMs to build bespoke classifiers that automatically label and segment inbound volumes—powering smarter routing, richer self‑serve insights, and swifter root‑cause analysis.
Partner with Data Engineering to ensure reliable pipelines, implement data‑quality checks, and document sources of truth.
Jump into high‑priority special projects to conduct bespoke deep‑dive analyses and deliver clear, strategic recommendations to leadership.
Prototype quickly—leveraging ChatGPT, Jupyter notebooks, Retool, and other tools—to prove value before hardening with Engineering.
Collaborate with Data Science on predictive models and experimentation, translating results into operational recommendations.


You Might Thrive In This Role If You


8 + years in analytics, business intelligence, or data science, ideally supporting customer support or operations teams.
Expert‑level SQL skills and proficiency in Python or R for advanced analysis and automation
Hands‑on experience designing and maintaining BI dashboards (e.g. Looker, Mode, Tableau, Sundial) with a focus on clarity and self‑serve usability.
Hands‑on experience fine‑tuning or prompt‑engineering LLMs to build text classifiers, sentiment analysis, or tagging systems.
Demonstrated ability to translate complex datasets into clear business stories and recommendations for both technical and non‑technical audiences.
Familiarity with support metrics (SLAs, FCR, deflection) and ability to define service health KPIs.
Strong cross‑functional communication skills—comfortable collaborating daily with engineers, data scientists, and operations leaders.
An eye for detail, a zero‑defect mindset, and a bias toward action over theoretical perfection
Possess a strong bias for automation and can defend governance decisions that keep data and processes healthy as they grow.
Thrive in a fast‑moving, ambiguous environment where priorities can shift quickly.

While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $182,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$160,000 - $205,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Designed with simplicity in mind, Verkada's six product lines — video security cameras, access control, environmental sensors, alarms, workplace, and intercoms — provide unparalleled building security through an integrated, cloud-based software platform. Over 33,500 organizations, including 96 companies in the Fortune 500, across 93 countries worldwide trust Verkada as their physical security layer for easier management, intelligent control, and scalable deployments. Founded in 2016 with more than $700M in funding raised to-date, Verkada has expanded rapidly with 15 offices and 2,200+ full-time employees.

About The Role

We are looking for an exceptional Sr. People Analytics Associate to join our growing People team. This role will partner with our Sr. Director of People Strategy and Operations to continue building and scaling our people analytics capability. This is a high-impact role for someone who’s excited to partner with People, Sales, Finance, and Executive teams to unlock insights that drive strategic talent decisions, improve employee experience, and support business growth.

What You'll Do


As a member of our People Strategy and Operations team, you will have an integral role in driving the insights, operations, and strategy. This role blends technical expertise, business acumen, and a passion for storytelling through data.
You will continue building the foundation for people analytics, including data pipelines, dashboards, and reporting standards across systems like Workday, Looker, Greenhouse, and Lattice.

You will also partner with Recruiting Operations and Talent Aquision leaders to design and maintain recruiting analytics dashboards that provide visibility into key metrics (e.g., pipeline health, time-to-fill, source effectiveness) and equip leaders to make data-driven hiring decisions.
You will drive cross-functional analytics projects that support strategic decisions on org design, retention, performance, and compensation.
You will maintain a strong data governance framework to ensure accuracy, privacy, and consistency across systems and reporting.


What You Bring


Since we’re still in scrappy startup mode, you’ll need to be a high-impact self-starter. You take initiative to move projects forward and can operate well with little guidance.
Raw Smarts: You’ve fine-tuned your first principle and conceptual problem-solving skills. You can look at complex problems and solve them from start to finish.
Strong analytical skills: you nerd out about data, can quickly structure analyses to answer key business questions to drive decision-making, and will also have perspectives on building the right data architecture. Advanced Excel and Google Sheets skills, with experience building and managing complex data models and calculations.
Technical capabilities: Proven experience designing data warehouses and dashboards (e.g., Looker, Workday, BigQuery), working with SQL, and integrating data across People systems.
Flexibility and hustle: You manage change and ambiguity well, and have no problems juggling multiple priorities while executing in a fast-paced environment. You’re comfortable pivoting quickly and often.
5+ years of experience in people analytics, workforce strategy, or business analytics, ideally in a high-growth or tech environment.

Through its robust suite of tools, Realtor.com® not only makes a significant impact on the real estate industry at large, but for consumers, navigating the biggest purchase they will make in their life, by providing a user experience that is easy to use, easy to understand, and most of all, easy to make decisions.

Data Analyst, Client Product Analytics

About http://Realtor.com :

At http://realtor.com , we have the most comprehensive and accurate coverage of real estate listings and the most engaged users across all the online real estate portals. Our mission is to make buying, selling, renting, and living in homes easier and more rewarding for everyone.

The Data Science and Analytics organization at http://realtor.com sits at the heart of this mission. We process and analyze terabytes of data every day that enable decisions for millions of home buyers, sellers, renters, dreamers, and real estate professionals. Our goal is to use this data to make the home buying experience a breeze for our consumers. We empower them with the most up-to-date information on properties, help them find their dream homes in the least amount of time, and match them with the most suitable realtor to meet their unique, individual needs.

Role Description:

We are looking for the best data and analytical minds to help us measure the effectiveness of our products that aim to make it simple and easy to buy and sell a home. To accomplish that task, we are looking for a Senior Data Analyst with a consumer services, business, or technology background to join our expanding Product Analytics team within the Enterprise Data Science and Analytics organization. The team you are joining acts as a “trusted” partner to our key product stakeholders helping them answer their most critical business questions. This could be accomplished by conducting strategic deep insight analysis, A/B experimentation design and measurement, or creating new innovative ways to measure the success of the business. This is a job for someone who not only possesses strong technical skills, but also the ability to take data and mold it into a cohesive story that enables our stakeholders to make informed business decisions. Ideal candidates will be comfortable presenting their findings to stakeholders.

We are looking for a Data Analyst III to join our Product Analytics team within the Data Science & Analytics organization with the goal of helping the extended product team evaluate the launch of new features aimed at accelerating the growth of our ecommerce sales channel, the Online Store. This role will be focused on measuring the effectiveness of the Online Store (think funnel performance) combined with helping the product team test and learn into new features and enhancements. The mission of the Product Analytics team is to be very strategic and pivotal to ensure that the company stays on course with meeting key OKRs (Objective and Key Results). This is not a traditional reporting role - a successful candidate will be able to take large amounts of data and be able to surface the “why” around data movements - not just the “what”

Responsibilities:

Business Performance Reporting, Visualization and Analysis: Be the primary partner for our cross-functional stakeholders to understand product performance. When a metric is ahead or behind expectations, dig in to drive meaningful, actionable insights that help the business performance improve or double-down on success.
Deep-Dive Analysis: Use advanced techniques (A/B experimentation, statistical modeling, matched pair, and/or machine learning) to analyze consumer product performance at a lead and feature level.  Create a rich understanding of how people are interacting with product features and use these insights to then make recommendations.
Opportunity Identification and Sizing: Both to set goals and help evaluate potential product enrichment  opportunities, you will be tasked with forecasting and opportunity sizing. This will help our Product stakeholders understand the short-run and long-run dynamics of proposed changes to our product strategy, and create targets for driving business performance as well as optimize lead generation and funnel improvement opportunities.
Partnership and Communication: Partner closely with our Product stakeholders to identify and unlock opportunities, and with other data teams to improve platform capabilities around data architecture, data visualization, data modeling, and testing platforms.
Build trust in all interactions and with Enterprise Consumer Data Mart and be an advocate for adoption
Be responsible for monitoring the success of visitors' engagement and conversion by tracking metrics and building new estimated KPIs if necessary (e.g., product usage metrics)
Build relationships with other products and analytics teams to share best practices and enrich analytic practices
Conduct quantitative analysis, ad hoc reports, & statistical models to understand the health and latest trends among product engagement and funnel conversion consumer metrics
Create impactful data insights and analysis from Analytic Plan creation thru End-of-Analysis summaries

Requirements:

Bachelor's Degree in Business Analytics, Math, Economics
2-5+ years of work experience analyzing data to answer business questions
Experience using data to analyze product feature performance is preferred
Experience in a consumer subscription business also relevant
Advanced knowledge in SQL and knowledge in Python or R a plus
Experience with digital analytics platforms like Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics is preferred
Experience with data exploration and data visualization tools such as Tableau, Shiny, Streamlit, etc.
Experience with cloud-based data environments such as AWS and Snowflake
Advanced technical and modeling skills including Excel or Google Sheet skills (e.g. pivot, vlookup, etc.) and data analytics 
Understanding of experimentation and statistics concepts (e.g. confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, etc.)
Ability to think strategically, analyze and interpret product performance drivers as well as how analyze a conversion funnel with key fallout points identified
Intense curiosity, high intellectual and analytical horsepower, passionate pursuit of analytics driven insights
Strong communication skills as well as written and verbal presentation skills and experience presenting to diverse audiences
Ability to thrive in a largely remote organization
Comfort working in a highly agile, intensely iterative environment
Self-motivated and self-managing, with strong time management and organizational skills

Mindful movement. It’s at the core of why we do what we do at ALO—it’s our calling. Because mindful movement in the studio leads to better living. It changes who yogis are off the mat, making their lives and their communities better. That’s the real meaning of studio-to-street: taking the consciousness from practice on the mat and putting it into practice in life.

OVERVIEW

We are seeking a Lead Data Analyst with a sharp strategic mindset, and a passion for turning data into business impact. This role goes beyond traditional analytics—you're not just crunching numbers; you're actively shaping the business. Acting as a close partner to the team leader, you’ll serve as both a thought leader and execution driver, helping translate complex data into persuasive narratives and strategic action. You’ll independently engage with cross-functional business stakeholders, influence high-impact decisions, and help build a scalable analytics function. You’ll also manage junior team members and contribute to AI-driven initiatives, empowering the business with smarter, faster insights. If you're a proactive, influential communicator who thrives at the intersection of business, data, and AI innovation, this is the role for you.

RESPONSIBILITIES


Partner directly with business stakeholders at all levels to define success metrics, lead strategic analyses, and guide decision-making across e-commerce, retail, marketing, and customer strategy.
Translate complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive growth and operational efficiency.
Design and lead high-impact A/B and multivariate tests.
Build and scale dashboards and automated reporting to enable data democratization.
Ensure data quality and partner with Data Engineering to validate end-to-end data implementation, from tracking to reporting.
Collaborate with AI and data science teams to integrate AI tools (e.g., LLMs, recommendation engines) into business workflows and decision support systems.
Leverage generative AI tools to accelerate insight generation, automate repetitive analysis, and enhance stakeholder communication.
Mentor junior analysts and foster a high-performance culture through best practices and coaching.
Support as the analytical right hand to the Senior Director of Analytics, helping prioritize and drive high-value data initiatives across the company.


QUALIFICATIONS


7–8 years of professional experience in data analytics, with a track record of using insights to shape business strategy in high-growth e-commerce or digitally enabled retail environments.
Minimum of 2 years of professional experience managing and developing junior team members.
Strong e-commerce domain expertise, including digital funnel optimization, omnichannel performance, customer segmentation, and merchandising analytics.
Strong business acumen and executive presence, with the ability to influence senior stakeholders through data storytelling.
Advanced SQL and proficiency in Python or R; strong grasp of experimentation design, statistics, and data modeling.
Proficiency in BI tools like Tableau or Thoughtspot; able to build scalable, intuitive dashboards from the ground up.
Experience collaborating with Data Science teams to build, deploy, and evaluate predictive models (e.g., forecasting, churn, LTV).
Familiarity with AI/ML applications in analytics, including generative AI (e.g., prompt engineering, LLMs), and AI-based tools for business decision support.
Self-starter with excellent communication and prioritization skills; comfortable managing projects with ambiguity and shifting priorities.


The base salary range for this position is $170,000-$190,000 per year which represents the current range for the base salary for this exempt position. Please note that actual salaries will vary based on factors including but not limited to location, experience, and performance.

Want to make an impact? Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.




We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.




Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, we work closely with our teams in Barcelona, San Antonio, Spokane, and remote locations. We’ve got a reputation for being a great place to work, having been named among the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Seattle Business Magazine and Washington’s Best Workplaces in the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies.




At Rover, our furry coworkers are just as important as our human ones—and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Along with making the joys of pet parenthood more accessible, we’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community of pet people—and that starts with our employees.




Who we're looking for:

The Marketing Analytics team supports the company’s marketing efforts, while also working with teams throughout the organization. The analytics team is responsible for a number of business-critical reports and data models that our global marketing teams rely on for daily reporting, budgeting, and analysis. We measure marketing attribution to understand how people become Rover customers, provide campaign reporting to monitor trends in cost efficiency and optimization, deliver lifecycle data to action against a variety of customer behaviors, and narrate the business to identify and prioritize new opportunities.




We are looking for an Analyst to support our Growth, International Expansion, Lifecycle, and SEO stakeholders with a focus on improving our reporting and dashboard structure. The ideal candidate will have experience working closely with business stakeholders and building data-driven narratives that enable clear decision making.




*This is a hybrid position that has the minimum expectation to work out of our Barcelona Office in the Poblenou neighborhood two days per week on Mondays and Thursdays. For this reason, candidates must be based in Barcelona or willing to relocate.




Your Responsibilities:

Work closely with analytics peers and marketing teams to narrate trends and insights, with a particular focus on our customer acquisition marketing programs.
Design reports and dashboards that enable clear, data-driven decision-making for marketing and cross-functional teams.
Refine our marketing attribution models to drive optimal resource allocation across paid and organic marketing channels.
Expand your expertise by supporting experiments such as A/B testing and Market Match tests to optimize strategies across multiple marketing functions.




Your Qualifications:

At least 2 years experience working with complex datasets to support business decision making.
Fluency in SQL.
Data visualisation tool experience (e.g. Mode, Looker, Tableau, etc.)
Ability to adapt your communication style to translate complex data insights for different audiences.
You have experience in owning small-to-medium projects from design to completion with limited guidance from your manager.
You understand when you are blocked, proactively seeking out for help within the team or the organization to move the project forward.




Nice to Have:

Python or R familiarity is helpful, but we welcome candidates eager to develop these skills.
Experience evaluating results of A/B tests as well as expertise in statistical analysis.
Understanding of marketing metrics such as clicks, CPC, CTR, impressions, and unit economics like customer LTV, payback period, and CAC.




Benefits of working at Rover:

Competitive compensation
Long-term incentive plan with a company performance-based cash payout
Permanent contract
Pension plan
Meal tickets through Cobee
Generous PTO allowance
Private health insurance
Discounted gym membership
Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time)
Monetary help for adopting a dog or cat plus yearly credit to use on our platform
A wide variety of snacks, fresh fruit, and beverages in our kitchen to keep yourself going
Regular team activities, including happy hours, game nights, and more

• Develop and maintain documentation for archival processes, testing scripts, and compliance checks.

• Monitor vendor performance and ensure deliverables are met according to project timelines and SLAs.

• Identify and troubleshoot issues in data archival processes and recommend improvements where applicable.

• Excellent analytical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills.

• Strong attention to detail with a methodical and organized approach to data.

Data Analyst (Ads Team)

As an Ads Data Analyst, you’ll play a critical role in analyzing considerable amounts of structured and unstructured data generated by both sides of our advertising platform (advertisers and users) and delivering insights that drive product development, customer success, user experience, and business objectives.

eMAG Ads is a distinct business vertical spanning both sides of the Marketplace, advertisers and customers. It consists of a demand-side suite of campaign, budget, targeting management and reporting tools, and a supply-side array of applications responsible for the real-time bidding, delivery and data collection functions of a cohesive PPC advertising Platform.

What you’ll have to do:


Extract, transform and load raw data from access logs, change data capture systems, databases, datalakes and other sources.
Perform exploratory data analysis on structured and unstructured data.
Derive insights and produce monitoring dashboards, reports, funnels and visualisations.
Produce insights from data related to operational, exploratory, hypothesis driven and experimental objectives.
Work closely with product, development, data platform and data science teams in problem and solution discovery, experiment design and decision making processes.
Understand existing datasets and available data; help design and shape new data collection and processing pipelines for new and existing features.
Monitor data quality, operational and experimental metrics and KPIs.


What makes you a good fit:


Proficient in SQL (capable of executing complex SQL queries); proficient in spreadsheet software such as Excel or Google Spreadsheets.
Experienced in deriving and communicating insights from data (abstract), via reports, visualizations or other modes of presentation (concrete), for a diverse stakeholder audience.
Resourceful, problem-solver.
Having a continuous improvement mindset, in love with the problem, not the solution.
Good communication skills, both written and oral (Romanian, English).
2-3 years of proven experience in a Data Analyst or similar role.


What makes you stand out:


Good command of Python/Jupyter Notebook.
Familiarity with Python libraries for more advanced data analysis and visualizations.
Working statistical knowledge.
Experience with query engines (AWS Athena, GCP Big Query, Impala).
Experience with cloud-based data solutions (AWS, GCP).


What we’ve prepared for you:


Medical subscription: Medicover, MedLife or Regina Maria.
A flexible budget that you can invest in yourself as you wish: meal tickets, holiday tickets, cultural vouchers, private pension, foreign language classes, eMAG, Fashion Days, Therme and Genius, membership to different gyms or even professional development classes.
Different discounts from our partners: banking, mobile, dental medicine or wellness.
Access to the Bookster library and free credits on the Hilio psycho-emotional health platform.
An accelerated learning environment, with access to over 100.000 curated online resources and platforms, learning academies and development programs.
New headquarters, where sleek design, natural light, and versatile spaces create an energizing and comfortable environment for hybrid work.

About Us

Vento is a venture capital firm backed by Exor, one of Europe’s leading investment companies, and the team behind Italian Tech Week, one of the continent’s most influential tech events. Over the past three years, we’ve invested in more than 130 startups and built over 30 from the ground up through our Venture Building program.

What is the Vento Venture Building Program?

Our program connects talented individuals, forms strong founding teams, explores new market opportunities, and helps build high-potential startups from the ground up. We’re looking for ambitious, driven people ready to fully commit to the founder journey.

How It Works


The program is a 6-month, full-time experience starting January 2026 in Turin, designed for those ready to take the leap and build a startup from scratch.
In the first three months, each selected founder receives a €3,750 grant to focus entirely on team formation, problem exploration, and market validation.
The first weeks are dedicated to getting to know each other through business case workshops, group activities, and market challenges developed with industry experts.
Teams of 2–3 people are formed based on complementary skills, motivation, and personal chemistry.
After team formation, you’ll move through fast-paced, iterative cycles of problem exploration, ideation, implementation, and testing. Speed and iteration are key.
Each team receives ongoing support: weekly check-ins, vertical and horizontal mentorship, and access to founders and investors through events and informal gatherings.


Investment

After three months, each team pitches to the Vento Investment Committee. If your team and idea are deemed investable, Vento will invest €80,000 for 10% equity. The journey concludes with the Investor Day at Italian Tech Week, where you’ll present your startup to leading funds and angel investors from across Europe.

Who We’re Looking For

We seek talented individuals with drive, clarity of thought, ambition, and execution skills. We’ve selected philosophers, architects, engineers, lawyers, and experienced operators. What matters is your willingness to build and your readiness to go all in.

You don’t need an idea or a team to apply, our structure focuses on people first and their ability to explore new markets and problems.

Key Dates


Applications open: Now until October 12, 2025
Bootcamp (in-person): Choose between the first session (November 29–December 2, 2025) or the second session (December 6–10, 2025)
Program kickoff: January 26, 2026
Investment Committee: May 2026
Investor Day: Italian Tech Week, September/October 2026 (dates TBD)


Apply by October 12th, 2025

Kraken powers some of the most innovative global developments in energy.




We’re a technology company focused on creating a smart, sustainable energy system. From optimising renewable generation, creating a more intelligent grid and enabling utilities to provide excellent customer experiences, our operating system for energy is transforming the industry around the world in a way that benefits everyone.




It’s a really exciting time in energy. Help us make a real impact on shaping a better, more sustainable future. 




Kraken Customer




What we do: build the most AI-driven, innovative, forward-thinking platform for energy management. From optimizing resources to delivering cost-effective, exceptional customer experiences through advanced Customer Information Systems (CIS), billing, meter data management, CRM, and AI-driven communications, Kraken is powering the next wave of innovation in the energy industry.




Why we do it: future energy will not look like energy as we know it today. We need to not just think about our future, but build for it. Now.




Who are we looking for?




We’re looking for an influential data and analytics leader who’s excited to work directly with clients — helping them build modern data capabilities, coach on data best practices, and help them get transformative from Kraken data. 

You should bring experience leading a high-performing analytics or data team; a love of working with clients; and a passion for driving the clean energy transition. (Energy experience nice-to-have, but not required.)




The role

You’ll work directly with Kraken clients to help them develop modern, transformative data and analytics capabilities as part of their broader Kraken transformation.




You’ll:

- Guide them as they rebuild critical reporting & analytics on Kraken data

- Coach client teams on “what good looks like” in analytics practices — including roles, tools, and processes.

- Occasionally get hands-on with sample SQL or BI to help unblock or demonstrate.

- Translate client needs into clear input for Kraken product and engineering

- You won’t be an implementation manager or a full-time analyst. This is a hybrid role: part coach, part practitioner, part translator — helping clients both adopt Kraken data smoothly and build lasting data capabilities to drive their transformation. Perfect for someone with strong data leadership chops who wants more client face-time and a high-impact role. 

- This is one of the first hires onto a new client-facing data team, giving you a chance to play a strategic role in establishing vision, practices, and playbook.







PLEASE SEND YOUR CV IN ENGLISH




What you’ll do:
Guide clients in redefining critical reporting and analytics to use new Kraken data and concepts, through working sessions, trainings, and occasional SQL/BI examples
Coach client data teams on best practices and help them spot gaps in skills, roles, tools, or process
Help clients identify reporting & analytics outcomes they need Kraken to drive and partner with product to deliver these 
Train Kraken’s broader client delivery team on how to ask effective data questions and leverage data to drive business impact





What you’ll need to have / be:
8+ years of experience in data analytics, business intelligence or related field (e.g., analytics manager or director, data consultant, lead data analyst, analytics engineer)
Familiarity with SQL and modern BI tools – enough to recognize and speak to what “good” looks like & construct examples
Excellent communications, collaboration and presentation skills
Strong grasp of modern data practices (team structure, tools, ways of working)
Experience working in an agile, product-led context
Excitement for a fast-paced, high-autonomy, fun environment
Strong influencing skills and ability to challenge traditional ways of thinking
For senior roles: Experience leading data teams

Kraken powers some of the most innovative global developments in energy.




We’re a technology company focused on creating a smart, sustainable energy system. From optimising renewable generation, creating a more intelligent grid and enabling utilities to provide excellent customer experiences, our operating system for energy is transforming the industry around the world in a way that benefits everyone.




It’s a really exciting time in energy. Help us make a real impact on shaping a better, more sustainable future. 




Kraken Customer




What we do: build the most AI-driven, innovative, forward-thinking platform for energy management. From optimizing resources to delivering cost-effective, exceptional customer experiences through advanced Customer Information Systems (CIS), billing, meter data management, CRM, and AI-driven communications, Kraken is powering the next wave of innovation in the energy industry.




Why we do it: future energy will not look like energy as we know it today. We need to not just think about our future, but build for it. Now.




Who are we looking for?




We’re looking for an influential data and analytics leader who’s excited to work directly with clients — helping them build modern data capabilities, coach on data best practices, and help them get transformative from Kraken data. 

You should bring experience leading a high-performing analytics or data team; a love of working with clients; and a passion for driving the clean energy transition. (Energy experience nice-to-have, but not required.)




The role

You’ll work directly with Kraken clients to help them develop modern, transformative data and analytics capabilities as part of their broader Kraken transformation.




You’ll:

- Guide them as they rebuild critical reporting & analytics on Kraken data

- Coach client teams on “what good looks like” in analytics practices — including roles, tools, and processes.

- Occasionally get hands-on with sample SQL or BI to help unblock or demonstrate.

- Translate client needs into clear input for Kraken product and engineering

- You won’t be an implementation manager or a full-time analyst. This is a hybrid role: part coach, part practitioner, part translator — helping clients both adopt Kraken data smoothly and build lasting data capabilities to drive their transformation. Perfect for someone with strong data leadership chops who wants more client face-time and a high-impact role. 

- This is one of the first hires onto a new client-facing data team, giving you a chance to play a strategic role in establishing vision, practices, and playbook.







PLEASE SEND YOUR CV IN ENGLISH




What you’ll do:
Guide clients in redefining critical reporting and analytics to use new Kraken data and concepts, through working sessions, trainings, and occasional SQL/BI examples
Coach client data teams on best practices and help them spot gaps in skills, roles, tools, or process
Help clients identify reporting & analytics outcomes they need Kraken to drive and partner with product to deliver these 
Train Kraken’s broader client delivery team on how to ask effective data questions and leverage data to drive business impact





What you’ll need to have / be:
8+ years of experience in data analytics, business intelligence or related field (e.g., analytics manager or director, data consultant, lead data analyst, analytics engineer)
Familiarity with SQL and modern BI tools – enough to recognize and speak to what “good” looks like & construct examples
Excellent communications, collaboration and presentation skills
Strong grasp of modern data practices (team structure, tools, ways of working)
Experience working in an agile, product-led context
Excitement for a fast-paced, high-autonomy, fun environment
Strong influencing skills and ability to challenge traditional ways of thinking
For senior roles: Experience leading data teams

Location: Hybrid - Boston/Springfield, MA  

Department: MM -- Data Eng & Analytics - Corp Tech  

Job Category: Systems Analysis/Design/Dev/OPS  




Job Summary:  

Are you a data detective with a knack for turning spreadsheets into gold? As a Senior Data Analyst at Ascenteum, you'll be supporting a complex SAP R/3 to S/4HANA finance migration project—think of it as a digital makeover for our financial systems, but without the dramatic music and reality TV cameras. Your mission? Ensure that our Finance Data Mart and Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) stay as accurate as your favorite trivia knowledge. You’ll collaborate with business partners, data engineering teams, BI developers, and SAP stakeholders in a hybrid work environment—because who said you can’t enjoy your pyjamas while being a data hero?




Key Responsibilities:  

- Lead the creation and maintenance of EDW data mapping documentation between EDW and finance systems (SAP)—sort of like being the GPS for our data, but without the annoying re-routing.  

- Team up with business and functional leads to gather and clarify financial data transformation and reporting requirements—think of yourself as the translator between finance and tech, minus the cape but with all the superpowers.  

- Support data profiling, cleansing, transformation, and validation activities—no, it's not as glamorous as a spa day for your data, but it does require a gentle touch!  

- Write and execute test strategies, including:  

 - Unit testing  

 - Functional integration testing  

 - User acceptance testing (UAT)—and yes, that means you must convince the users that data isn’t out to get them.  

- Collaborate with the BI reporting team to validate data structures and assist with post-migration reporting needs—like being a supportive friend who always has a backup plan.  

- Partner with data engineers and solution architects to define and verify transformation rules—because every hero needs a sidekick!  

- Log and track issues, supporting resolutions during testing cycles; and keep appropriate documentation—if only life had a tracking number for all our problems!  

- Contribute to SteerCo reporting by providing data readiness updates, issue status, and impact summaries—this is where you become the oracle of all things data!  

- Collaborate with Project Managers to maintain and support the RAID log (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies)—no, not that kind of RAID, this one won't need a therapist!  

- Align with both offshore and onshore teams on requirements, deliverables, and timelines—because teamwork makes the dream work, even if we are all in different time zones!




Required Qualifications:  

- 6+ years of experience in data analysis, particularly in finance or enterprise data systems—you’ve wrestled data before, and you won!  

- 2+ years of experience working on SAP projects—because learning curve? What learning curve?  

- Proficient in SQL and familiar with data validation and reconciliation techniques—your SQL skills should impress even the most stubborn databases.  

- Functional knowledge of SAP finance modules (General Ledger, Accounts Payable/Receivable, Fixed Assets, Controlling)—you basically know these modules better than most folks know their grocery lists.  

- Experience with data mapping, data dictionaries, and transformation logic documentation—this makes you the librarian of our data universe!  

- Hands-on experience writing and executing test plans, especially for functional integration testing—think of it as being the referee in a data wrestling match.  

- Strong analytical and communication skills—you can communicate complex issues to others without making them weep.  

- Proficiency in Microsoft Excel and BI tools such as Power BI, Tableau, or SAP Analytics Cloud—because you’re the wizard who can conjure visuals from thin air!




Preferred Qualifications:  

- Familiarity with Finance Accounting Transformation and finance data migration—you could probably write a book on this stuff (or at least the first few chapters).  

- Experience supporting financial reconciliation, audit readiness, or compliance-driven data initiatives—because who doesn’t love a good compliance story?  

- Exposure to cloud-based data platforms (e.g., Snowflake, AWS, Azure)—just don’t try to fly the cloud.  

- Comfortable working in hybrid project delivery environments that incorporate Agile or waterfall methodologies—whether you’re paddling a kayak or sailing a yacht, you know how to navigate the waters!




Why Join Ascenteum?  

At Ascenteum, we believe that work doesn’t have to be serious all the time. Here, we value innovation, collaboration, and the occasional bad joke to lighten the mood. If you’re a detail-oriented analyst with a passion for data and a sense of humor, we want to hear from you! No capes required, but they are welcome.




---




Feel free to adjust the humor to fit the culture you envision for your workplace!
