Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Working remotely at Stripe

A remote location is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

But it’s also pretty exciting. We pull together data from thousands of jurisdictions to normalize, contextualize, and visualize these metrics so the data is approachable and understandable.




Every day, we learn something about our country, how to make complex data understandable, and how to make the American people interested in the numbers. We’re a collaborative group and are always learning from each other, too. The team is mission driven, with no political agenda nor commercial incentive; we do this work purely as a public service.

Design user experiences that guide viewers effectively through data stories, while collaborating with editorial teams to ensure accurate and engaging content.

Technical Implementation: Develop visualizations using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and specialized libraries like D3.js. Build interactive features that enhance user engagement and data exploration.

Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.

Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.

Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1.4B+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.

We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.

About The Role

Rippling is building the future of how businesses run — and our Data Cloud team is on a mission to give every customer a full-stack data platform to understand and operate their business, across every function: HR, IT, Finance, and beyond.

We’re looking for a Data Analyst to join our product team — but this isn’t your typical analyst role. You won’t be sitting in a silo writing dashboards for exec reviews. Instead, you’ll be at the center of how we dogfood our own analytics products, solve real reporting needs for our internal teams (starting with HR), and translate those solutions into customer-facing templates, recipes, and product feedback.

If you’re the kind of person who’s happiest when you’re deep in SQL one minute, building dashboards the next, and collaborating with product managers to make tools better the minute after that — this is your role.

What You Will Do


Support internal reporting use cases: Be the go-to person for Rippling’s internal HR reporting needs — helping them define the right metrics, write the SQL, and build clean dashboards using our own reporting tools.
Productize real solutions: Take the reports and dashboards you build for internal teams and turn them into recipes or templates that any Rippling customer can use.
Shape the future of the product: Because you’ll be living in our product every day, you’ll become a key voice for what’s working and what’s not — surfacing gaps, proposing improvements, and even influencing the roadmap.
Be the “power user” of our data stack: Our team builds everything from ingestion to transformation to dashboards. You’ll be working across this full stack, helping make it more usable and scalable through your daily work.
Drive self-serve analytics adoption: Help internal teams (starting with HR) reduce their dependence on ad hoc requests by building the right dashboards and templates to unlock self-serve.


What Success Looks Like


Internal teams can get the reports they need faster — and without asking twice.
Your dashboards become models for how customers solve similar reporting problems.
Your feedback helps us make major product improvements.
We ship better data products because you’ve helped us dogfood our own tools thoroughly and thoughtfully.
You are seen as both a trusted reporting partner and a product-minded analyst who can bridge internal needs and customer-facing solutions.


What You Will Need


3+ years working with data.
Proficiency in SQL and hands-on experience with data exploration and dashboarding tools (Looker, Mode, Tableau, etc.).
A strong sense of product empathy — you don’t just solve the problem, you think about how others could solve it too.
Experience working with People, HR, or GTM teams is a plus.
Comfort navigating ambiguity, unstructured questions, and imperfect data.
Bonus: familiarity with dbt, analytics engineering, or data governance principles.


Why This Role Is Special

This role lives inside the product team, not on a siloed analytics team. That means:


Your work directly informs how we build and improve our data products.
You’re empowered to propose ideas, templates, and workflows based on real usage.
You get to see immediate impact — both internally and externally — from what you build.


This is a great fit for someone who wants to stay hands-on with data, but also get exposure to product development and influence what we ship.

Apply if…


You love using data to unlock clarity for others.
You get excited by operational reporting — not just vanity metrics.
You want to be part of a team building powerful tools and using them every day.
You’re curious, self-directed, and opinionated about what great looks like.

The User Operations team is central to ensuring that our customers' experience with our products is nothing short of exceptional. We resolve complex issues, provide technical guidance, and support customers in maximizing value and adoption from deploying our products. We work closely with Sales, Technical Success, Product, Engineering and others to deliver the best possible experience to our customers at scale. OpenAI's customers represent a range of diverse backgrounds and maturity, from early-stage startups to established global enterprises. Given OpenAI’s breakneck shipping cadence and growth—and the expectation that it will only accelerate—transforming our rich support data into real‑time insights and scalable, self‑serve analytics is critical to sustaining exceptional customer experiences on the path to AGI.

About The Role

We’re seeking a User Operations Data Analyst who will dig deep into user‑support data—surfacing trends, volumes, and friction signals—and turn these findings into actionable insights and always‑on reporting. You’ll design, build, and maintain self‑serve dashboards that keep every stakeholder informed in real time, partnering closely with Data Science and Engineering to ensure clean pipelines, robust models, and scalable tooling. Think proactive friction detection and real‑time service‑health views that help us stay ahead of demand—delivering decision‑grade insights, not just prettier slide decks.

This role is based in San Francisco, California. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In This Role, You Will


Explore large support and product datasets to uncover trends, volume drivers, and user‑experience pain points, distilling findings into clear, actionable narratives.
Build, enhance, and maintain self‑serve dashboards and reporting tools, enabling non‑technical teams to answer their own data questions.
Establish a unified metrics taxonomy for service‑health and performance—and build automated data‑sharing pipelines and scorecards with our BPO partners to ensure everyone operates from the same real‑time view of success
Leverage LLMs to build bespoke classifiers that automatically label and segment inbound volumes—powering smarter routing, richer self‑serve insights, and swifter root‑cause analysis.
Partner with Data Engineering to ensure reliable pipelines, implement data‑quality checks, and document sources of truth.
Jump into high‑priority special projects to conduct bespoke deep‑dive analyses and deliver clear, strategic recommendations to leadership.
Prototype quickly—leveraging ChatGPT, Jupyter notebooks, Retool, and other tools—to prove value before hardening with Engineering.
Collaborate with Data Science on predictive models and experimentation, translating results into operational recommendations.


You Might Thrive In This Role If You


8 + years in analytics, business intelligence, or data science, ideally supporting customer support or operations teams.
Expert‑level SQL skills and proficiency in Python or R for advanced analysis and automation
Hands‑on experience designing and maintaining BI dashboards (e.g. Looker, Mode, Tableau, Sundial) with a focus on clarity and self‑serve usability.
Hands‑on experience fine‑tuning or prompt‑engineering LLMs to build text classifiers, sentiment analysis, or tagging systems.
Demonstrated ability to translate complex datasets into clear business stories and recommendations for both technical and non‑technical audiences.
Familiarity with support metrics (SLAs, FCR, deflection) and ability to define service health KPIs.
Strong cross‑functional communication skills—comfortable collaborating daily with engineers, data scientists, and operations leaders.
An eye for detail, a zero‑defect mindset, and a bias toward action over theoretical perfection
Possess a strong bias for automation and can defend governance decisions that keep data and processes healthy as they grow.
Thrive in a fast‑moving, ambiguous environment where priorities can shift quickly.

We Build The Most Complete And Accurate Picture Of The B2B Buyer By Integrating With Every Tool Your Team Uses, Partnering With Third-party Data Providers, And Deploying Custom AI Research Agents. We Use This Data To Power Applications That Automate High-value, High-complexity Workflows Across The Go-to-market And Revenue Teams. Our Core Products Include


Marketing Intelligence – instantly answers questions like “What led to that sudden drop in pipeline?”
Account Intelligence – surfaces next-best actions to help reps move target accounts toward conversion


Since launching in January 2023, we’ve come through Y Combinator, raised a $20M Series A led by Bessemer. We’re growing 3× year-over-year, have hit multimillion ARR, and process over 60 TB of GTM data monthly. Based at our San Francisco HQ, we operate fully in-person, move fast and hire people who are ready to win.

🚀 Your Mission

We are seeking a customer-focused Data Analyst to help our clients answer their most important business questions around GTM revenue performance and marketing spend optimization. This is not a heavy data-engineering role; instead, you’ll use HockeyStack’s platform and available data to guide customers toward impactful insights and recommendations.

🔧 What You’ll Do


Partner with customers to solve their revenue goals, challenges, and questions. Use HockeyStack’s platform to uncover insights and deliver clear, actionable recommendations.
Translate complex metrics into straightforward explanations for non-technical audiences.
Be the Data Partner to support Customer Success Managers in delivering strategic guidance to clients.
Identify patterns and trends in marketing and sales data to advise customers on where to focus efforts.
Collaborate with internal teams to continuously enhance the customer experience.


🧩 Core Strengths


Business Insight: Ability to connect data to revenue outcomes and business strategy.
Customer Orientation: Skilled at understanding client goals and delivering value through insights.
Analytical Thinking: Comfortable framing and answering complex questions with data-driven logic.
Clear Communication: Able to translate analytics into simple, impactful recommendations.


🧬 What We’re Looking For


Ownership-first mindset — you take initiative, move fast, and figure things out
Thrive in early-stage, high-urgency environments where speed and impact matter
Curious, self-aware, and feedback-driven — you bring energy, not ego
See this role as a defining chapter — not a stepping stone or side quest
Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Data Science, Applied Economics, or a related field.
1–3 years of experience in Data Analytics or Consulting with Analytical focus. Strong preference for candidates with Marketing Analytics or GTM/Sales Analytics Experience.
Strong problem-solving skills with the ability to structure and answer key business questions.
Excellent communication skills to convey data-driven insights to senior stakeholders.
Familiarity with SaaS, B2B marketing, or revenue analytics is a strong plus.
Ability to think strategically and recommend actions based on data, without needing to deep-dive into raw datasets.


✨ Why Join Now?

We’re at an inflection point. The product is proven, the market is massive, and the opportunity is wide open. You’ll be joining a company with real traction, rapid growth, and meaningful backing—where every person still shapes the outcome. This isn’t just a job. It’s a chance to build something category-defining with people who care deeply about doing it right.

We’re building a high-performing, in-person culture at our San Francisco HQ, where the team collaborates shoulder-to-shoulder five days a week. While that's our standard for most roles, this position is uniquely flexible—offering remote options for exceptional candidates based in the U.S. or internationally, as long as you're fully available during U.S. business hours. The base salary range for this role is $40,000 to $120,000 USD, adjusted for location, experience, and qualifications.

HockeyStack is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, protected veteran status, disability, or any other legally protected status.

Built by ex-Googlers, startup veterans, and industry pros, our AI boosts productivity, slashes admin burden, and creates new ways to support patients with chronic conditions. We scale connections between patients, payors, and providers — empowering care teams and improving health outcomes.

The Mission

At Infinitus, our mission is simple: create time for healthcare by making access, adherence, and affordability easier than ever. Using multimodal AI, human-in-the-loop systems, and a rich knowledge graph, we’ve automated over 5 million calls—saving millions of hours for patients and providers.

Backed by top investors like Kleiner Perkins, Google Ventures, and a16z, we’re a team that loves to challenge the status quo and move fast at the intersection of AI and healthcare.

Your Role

We’re looking for a Senior Data Analyst to play a pivotal role in shaping how our organization uses data to make decisions, improve products, and drive growth.

This is a senior, high-visibility role where you’ll partner with leaders across Product, Engineering, Finance, Operations, and Marketing to solve challenging problems, from portfolio optimization to user experience analysis. You’ll also mentor other analysts, help set analytical standards, and ensure our work meets the highest compliance and governance requirements.

Our mission is to create time for healthcare by making access, adherence, and affordability easier than ever—and we need your expertise to make our data work harder toward that goal.

Build better tools: Lead the development of AI-powered analytics and automated reporting systems to improve performance and outcomes.

Drive insight at scale: Create and maintain KPIs, dashboards, and monitoring systems that identify trends, uncover opportunities, and guide business strategy.

Collaborate deeply: Work closely with cross-functional teams to integrate analytics into product roadmaps, operational processes, and strategic initiatives.

Mentor and elevate: Help junior analysts grow their skills in analysis, communication, and technical execution.

Safeguard data integrity: Ensure analytics work meets rigorous compliance, governance, and privacy standards—especially in a regulated healthcare environment.

Your Skillset

Experience: 7+ years in data analytics, with proven ability to extract insights from large, complex data sets.

Industry: Background in regulated industries; healthcare experience strongly preferred.

Technical skills:


Deep fluency in SQL (5+ years)
Strong Python skills for analytics workflows
Experience with visualization tools (Sigma, Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Mode, Metabase, or Hex)
Proficiency in building and validating statistical / machine learning models
Expertise in optimization algorithms, seasonal models, and portfolio analysis


Strategic skills: Able to translate ambiguous business problems into clear, data-driven solutions.

Collaboration: Comfortable working with multiple commercial partners on data sourcing, integration, and model building.

Communication: Strong ability to translate complex findings into clear, compelling narratives for technical and non-technical audiences.

Mindset: Startup-tested, adaptable to shifting priorities, energized by complex problems.

Education: Master’s degree in Mathematics, Engineering, or Data Science; Bachelor’s in a related field such as Statistics, Computer Science, Economics, or Physics.

Why You’ll Love It Here


Hybrid work (SF office Mon/Tues/Thurs) + catered lunches
Competitive salary, equity, and 401(k)

Millions of people around the world come to our platform to find creative ideas, dream about new possibilities and plan for memories that will last a lifetime. At Pinterest, we’re on a mission to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love, and that starts with the people behind the product.

Discover a career where you ignite innovation for millions, transform passion into growth opportunities, celebrate each other’s unique experiences and embrace the flexibility to do your best work. Creating a career you love? It’s Possible.

The mission of the Business Operations team is to assess how well Pinterest’s strategy is delivering enterprise performance and influence exec-level decisions to evolve strategy and operations accordingly. As the Data Analyst II (Users & Engagement), you will shape, support and deliver on the analytical agenda that provides critical business insights for our Exec Team while partnering with Product, Engineering, Data Science, and others to improve how we execute. With a combination of exceptional analytical skills, insatiable curiosity, and strong partnering skills, you’ll help us better understand how to grow user adoption and engagement on Pinterest.

What You’ll Do


Business Analytics & Reporting. Develop a deep understanding of the Users & Engagement challenges and roadmap and how they drive our business / user experience to inform important decisions and priorities across the organization. Define critical KPIs and build key reporting deliverables and dashboards to help senior leadership understand key metric movements and trends, drive operational rigor and manage performance.
Planning & Forecasting. Manage the forecast models for core topline metrics that drive company-wide forecasting, goal-setting, and strategic planning. Work with a range of senior leaders to update their strategic priorities and goals on a regular basis.
Strategy & Special Projects. Tackle ambiguous strategic questions and critical business initiatives, and partner with leaders throughout Pinterest to build business cases for potential investments. Present insights and recommendations to senior leadership, and drive the “follow through” of those recommendations to ensure smooth execution with a diverse array of cross-functional partners.



What We’re Looking For


Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as economics, business administration, or data analytics or equivalent experience.
3+ years of experience in analytical or strategic roles. You’ve been a top performer in an investing, consulting, investment banking, product, and/or other highly analytical role at a fast-growing company; knowledge of the consumer internet and media ecosystem is a plus.
Exceptional data analysis skills. You’re a true expert in a variety of analytical tools, including SQL, Tableau, and Excel (and in areas you’re not, you have the growth mindset to learn it); knowledge of Python and R is a plus.
Entrepreneurial self-starter. You thrive in a fast-moving, ambiguous environment, and are independently capable of seeking information, corralling resources, and delivering results without waiting for direction.
Strong communication skills. You can move seamlessly between conversing with engineers or frontline ops employees and leading presentations with senior executives.
Keen aptitude to scale the team. Help build out processes for a small (but mighty) team. Help build our influence across the organization to tackle each of the above for your coverage area.

EVERY™ is a leading VC-backed food tech ingredient company and market leader using precision fermentation to create animal proteins without the animal for the global food and beverage industry. EVERY™ is a team of passionate change-makers who are reimagining the factory farm model with a kinder, more sustainable alternative. Leveraging precision fermentation to produce hyper-functional and one-to-one replacement proteins from microorganisms, EVERY™ is on a mission to decouple the world’s proteins from the animals that make them. We are a passionate, determined (and fun!) team with a vital objective, and we're on the lookout for like-minded people to join our mission. For more information, visit www.every.com 

The Role: 

We’re looking for a Data Analytics Engineer who can bridge the gap between data analysis and software engineering. This is a hybrid role for someone who’s excited to work across systems, dig into messy data, and build tools and pipelines that help teams make better decisions, faster.

You are a technical expert that will partner closely with stakeholders across science, product, and operations, helping us translate questions into clean, usable data and insights. This role is part of our long-term data strategy and will own key parts of our analytics reporting services supporting the organization’s data infrastructure.

What you'll accomplish

Bring dashboards to life for teams across R&D, manufacturing, supply chain, and business operations making it easier for them to access the data they need without manual work or spreadsheet juggling.
Cut down reporting delays by connecting backend systems (like BigQuery and Cloud SQL) to intuitive dashboards and tools that surface real-time insights.
Take ownership of internal data tools, helping keep it running smoothly while making quick improvements when bugs or user requests come up.
Scale our data systems and company tools as business needs expand to require additional software.
Partner with stakeholders to understand what really matters, then turn those needs into usable, self-serve tools and dashboards that make decisions faster and more accurate.
Write clean, maintainable SQL and Python that powers everything from dashboards to lightweight backend fixes—removing blockers and improving the flow of information across the org.
Jump in where needed on smaller data and analytics projects whether that’s building a quick connector, cleaning up an API, or filling a gap in reporting.

What you bring (required)

3–5+ years of experience in data analytics, analytics engineering, or full-stack data roles
Strong SQL skills, with experience modeling data for reporting and decision-making (e.g., via dbt, Looker, or custom dashboards)
Python experience for scripting, automation, and backend data support
Building data visualization and dashboards (Looker, Tableau, Qlikview etc.)
Experience working with data warehouses & API integration  (GCP, AWS, BigQuery preferred) and connecting them to downstream tools
Familiarity with building or supporting internal tools and applications  (Netsuite, LIMS, or similar lightweight frameworks)
Comfortable working directly with business users to translate messy needs into clean, usable dashboards and reports
Strong problem-solving skills and ability to move quickly in ambiguous or fast-changing environments
Bonus: Familiarity with working in biotech/manufacturing settings and data architecture.

Pay Range: $130,000 - $170,000 + Stock Options

At EVERY™, pay ranges are subject to change and assigned to a job based on the location-specific market median of similar jobs according to 3rd-party salary benchmark surveys. Individual pay within that range can vary for several reasons including skills/capabilities, experience, and available budget.

EVERY’s Dedication to Fairness

EVERY is dedicated to building a just environment based on merit and kindess. EVERY’s goal is to have a workplace that enables productivity and meaningful work for individuals from all backgrounds, experiences, and lifestyles, allowing all employees to feel comfortable being their true, authentic selves at work.

Legal authorization to work in the U.S. is required.  We are not able to sponsor individuals for employment visas for this job. In compliance with federal law, all persons hired will be required to verify personal information and eligibility to work in the United States and to complete the required employment eligibility verification form upon hire.

Want to make an impact? Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.




We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.




Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, we work closely with our teams in Barcelona, San Antonio, Spokane, and remote locations. We’ve got a reputation for being a great place to work, having been named among the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Seattle Business Magazine and Washington’s Best Workplaces in the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies.




At Rover, our furry coworkers are just as important as our human ones—and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Along with making the joys of pet parenthood more accessible, we’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community of pet people—and that starts with our employees.




Who we're looking for:

Project Management: Define business cases, monitor KPIs, and manage project plans and budgets.
Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of analytics trends and share knowledge within the team.
Quality Assurance: Ensure data accuracy and maintain high-quality documentation.

A place where you can contribute to something bigger! Many of our brands have societal/environmental causes to make a concrete difference.

As the role is our entry level, this is a great entry point for a career path at Lokad, either as a future technical expert or as manager.




We help companies in different verticals (aerospace, automotive, ecommerce…) to forecast and make decisions about their inventory. The vast majority of our clients are based outside of France, mainly in North America and Europe.




As a Business Data Analyst (or Supply Chain Scientist in Lokad's terminology), your role is to make sure our clients get the most from Lokad's technology. The role is a mix between technology, data crunching and supply chain expertise. You will address complex supply chain issues and craft quantitative strategies. Your goal is not only to advise your clients on strategies to adopt, but to craft and execute these strategies on a daily basis while leveraging the data available as much as possible. Your goal is also to keep refining these strategies over time to keep them aligned with the needs of our clients.




At Lokad, you will benefit from the extensive training and coaching of our expert team. You will gain skills in supply chain, predictive analysis and overall quantitative optimization for business. You will learn how to achieve measurable business results grounded on scientific analysis of data.




About one quarter of your time is spent interacting with clients in order to better understand their business (mainly over the phone or by mail, with occasional travels). Note that, in order to benefit from your colleagues expertise, you won't be required to work on the customers' premises.




The rest of your time is spent on data analysis, including manipulating and cleaning data, setting up forecasts, economic optimization, reporting and data vizualisation. In order to do this, you'll learn to use our Differentiable Programming tools and a DSL (Envision) developped by Lokad.




We are looking for candidates with the following skills and qualities:




A strong engineering background.
A keen interest in data and quantitative analysis in general.
Good Excel skills or programming skills (e.g. Python, VBA, SQL, etc.).
Impeccable command of English ( French is optional).
Excellent communication skills and telephone manners.
A well-made head, rather than a well-filled head. We are not looking for someone who is already an expert in supply chain or programming. We’re looking for a fast learner, with an ability to quickly grasp technology and concepts, since our technology is by no means a simple and plug-and-play product. Knowledge or understanding of supply chain would be a bonus, but the ability to quickly assess and grasp a new situation or get a clear picture of how an organization works and what are the pain points is what we are really after.
Candidates must be self-motivated, confident and highly driven to achieve results with a “hands on” attitude.




The role is predominantly office based, although some travel will be occasionally required to customers, partners or events. We are located in the very center of Paris, France (station Chevaleret).

Data Analyst (Ads Team)

As an Ads Data Analyst, you’ll play a critical role in analyzing considerable amounts of structured and unstructured data generated by both sides of our advertising platform (advertisers and users) and delivering insights that drive product development, customer success, user experience, and business objectives.

eMAG Ads is a distinct business vertical spanning both sides of the Marketplace, advertisers and customers. It consists of a demand-side suite of campaign, budget, targeting management and reporting tools, and a supply-side array of applications responsible for the real-time bidding, delivery and data collection functions of a cohesive PPC advertising Platform.

What you’ll have to do:


Extract, transform and load raw data from access logs, change data capture systems, databases, datalakes and other sources.
Perform exploratory data analysis on structured and unstructured data.
Derive insights and produce monitoring dashboards, reports, funnels and visualisations.
Produce insights from data related to operational, exploratory, hypothesis driven and experimental objectives.
Work closely with product, development, data platform and data science teams in problem and solution discovery, experiment design and decision making processes.
Understand existing datasets and available data; help design and shape new data collection and processing pipelines for new and existing features.
Monitor data quality, operational and experimental metrics and KPIs.


What makes you a good fit:


Proficient in SQL (capable of executing complex SQL queries); proficient in spreadsheet software such as Excel or Google Spreadsheets.
Experienced in deriving and communicating insights from data (abstract), via reports, visualizations or other modes of presentation (concrete), for a diverse stakeholder audience.
Resourceful, problem-solver.
Having a continuous improvement mindset, in love with the problem, not the solution.
Good communication skills, both written and oral (Romanian, English).
2-3 years of proven experience in a Data Analyst or similar role.


What makes you stand out:


Good command of Python/Jupyter Notebook.
Familiarity with Python libraries for more advanced data analysis and visualizations.
Working statistical knowledge.
Experience with query engines (AWS Athena, GCP Big Query, Impala).
Experience with cloud-based data solutions (AWS, GCP).


What we’ve prepared for you:


Medical subscription: Medicover, MedLife or Regina Maria.
A flexible budget that you can invest in yourself as you wish: meal tickets, holiday tickets, cultural vouchers, private pension, foreign language classes, eMAG, Fashion Days, Therme and Genius, membership to different gyms or even professional development classes.
Different discounts from our partners: banking, mobile, dental medicine or wellness.
Access to the Bookster library and free credits on the Hilio psycho-emotional health platform.
An accelerated learning environment, with access to over 100.000 curated online resources and platforms, learning academies and development programs.
New headquarters, where sleek design, natural light, and versatile spaces create an energizing and comfortable environment for hybrid work.

Job Description

About L.E.K. Consulting

L.E.K. Consulting is a global strategy consulting firm that addresses the most critical commercial issues for the leaders of some of the world's most successful businesses.

Clients come to us time and again because we are proven to act as an insightful expert and a trusted partner. We are uncompromising in our approach to help clients make better decisions at crucial moments, changing the trajectory of their enterprise, delivering improved business performance and creating greater shareholder returns.

Our teams combine our core capabilities of research, benchmarking, modelling, data & analytics and strategy development to create game-changing insights and practical solutions that seize competitive advantage and unlock new growth opportunities. We enable clients to make critical decisions with greater certainty and empower them to master their moments of truth.

With more than 2,300 professionals located across five continents, L.E.K. specialises in Strategy and Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) support with clients across the full range of corporates and private equity. We are expert in a wide range of industries, including Life Sciences and healthcare, retail and consumer, financial services, industrials, energy and transportation.

The Associate position

The Associate role at L.E.K. offers exposure to multiple industry sectors and a wide variety of commercial challenges. The nature and pace of L.E.K.’s strategic work facilitates the rapid development of a highly analytical skill set in a collaborative and rewarding team-based environment. As you progress you will take on a significant level of responsibility and build your leadership skills.

Responsibilities

Associates are crucial to the success of L.E.K. project teams. With the guidance and support of an experienced senior team, you will be responsible for:


Conducting primary and secondary research on markets, competitors, and customers
Performing rigorous strategic and financial analyses, using leading-edge software and techniques, to develop deep understanding of commercial issues
Collaborating with team members to identify trends, draw conclusions, develop insights and transform those insights into actionable recommendations for the client
Making L.E.K. an enjoyable and rewarding place to work by coaching colleagues and transferring skills, offering constructive advice, and contributing to a welcoming and friendly office culture


Who We Are Looking For

We are currently seeking exceptional and committed individuals with the ability to solve complex problems in a creative way. Successful candidates typically possess outstanding academic achievements, are comfortable with quantitative analysis, have excellent verbal and written communication skills in Spanish and English, relevant professional experience, and notable extracurricular interests. Fluency in another European language is considered an asset.

We are looking for a sense of intellectual curiosity that will inspire you to develop a deep understanding of any client situation, and to generate innovative answers to complex questions. We want people with the ability to think in logical, structured ways, together with the creativity to look beyond the obvious. We recruit from a wide range of disciplines in both the arts and sciences, and do not require existing technical skills – just a strong desire to learn.

Our team-oriented approach requires individuals who can collaborate and communicate well. We seek proactive, energetic, and enthusiastic candidates who take ownership of their work and make a meaningful impact.

What We Offer

Training and development

The Associate position at L.E.K. is a launch-pad for your career. As a new Associate you will be supported with a comprehensive initial two-week orientation programme, followed by thorough monthly training sessions designed to complement your on-the-job experience. These cover the full range of skills needed to develop and progress your career within L.E.K., allowing promotion to the Consultant role without attaining an MBA. For those who go on to pursue roles in industry or Private Equity, the highly valuable commercial and analytical skill set, and broad commercial experience of an L.E.K. Associate are in great demand.

International Experience And Exchange Programme

L.E.K. offers you the opportunity to swap to one of our global offices for six months. This is a popular way to experience a different business environment, gain exposure to new industries and specialisms and experience a different culture. In addition, you will often work with colleagues from other offices, on projects with an international scope.

Application Process

Our application process is now open for positions starting in March 2026.

Please upload your application documents (cover letter, CV, references) on our career site by clicking the ""Apply"" button.

After completing the online application process, selected candidates will be contacted by our Recruitment Team and invited to a numerical reasoning test followed by a series of interviews. Applicants stating 'fluency' in a language will have this assessed during the recruitment process. Please note that fluency in both Spanish and English are a requirement for this position.

We are looking forward to receiving your application!

Diversity and inclusion at L.E.K.

Here at L.E.K., we appreciate the value of a diverse and inclusive workforce and are committed to a culture that is inclusive and accepting of all people. Above all, we are committed to ensuring that all employees are treated with respect and dignity. L.E.K. Consulting is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

We have several affinity groups to support and enrich our employees and in addition, our Diversity and Inclusion committee celebrate events throughout the year with a focus on awareness and education.

Job Description

About L.E.K. Consulting

L.E.K. Consulting is a global strategy consulting firm that addresses the most critical commercial issues for the leaders of some of the world's most successful businesses.

Clients come to us time and again because we are proven to act as an insightful expert and a trusted partner. We are uncompromising in our approach to help clients make better decisions at crucial moments, changing the trajectory of their enterprise, delivering improved business performance and creating greater shareholder returns.

Our teams combine our core capabilities of research, benchmarking, modelling, data & analytics and strategy development to create game-changing insights and practical solutions that seize competitive advantage and unlock new growth opportunities. We enable clients to make critical decisions with greater certainty and empower them to master their moments of truth.

With more than 2,300 professionals located across five continents, L.E.K. specialises in Strategy and Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) support with clients across the full range of corporates and private equity. We are expert in a wide range of industries, including Life Sciences and healthcare, retail and consumer, financial services, industrials, energy and transportation.

The Associate position

The Associate role at L.E.K. offers exposure to multiple industry sectors and a wide variety of commercial challenges. The nature and pace of L.E.K.’s strategic work facilitates the rapid development of a highly analytical skill set in a collaborative and rewarding team-based environment. As you progress you will take on a significant level of responsibility and build your leadership skills.

Responsibilities

Associates are crucial to the success of L.E.K. project teams. With the guidance and support of an experienced senior team, you will be responsible for:


Conducting primary and secondary research on markets, competitors, and customers
Performing rigorous strategic and financial analyses, using leading-edge software and techniques, to develop deep understanding of commercial issues
Collaborating with team members to identify trends, draw conclusions, develop insights and transform those insights into actionable recommendations for the client
Making L.E.K. an enjoyable and rewarding place to work by coaching colleagues and transferring skills, offering constructive advice, and contributing to a welcoming and friendly office culture


Who We Are Looking For

We are currently seeking exceptional and committed individuals with the ability to solve complex problems in a creative way. Successful candidates typically possess outstanding academic achievements, are comfortable with quantitative analysis, have excellent verbal and written communication skills in German and English, relevant professional experience, and notable extracurricular interests. Fluency in another European language is considered an asset.

We are looking for a sense of intellectual curiosity that will inspire you to develop a deep understanding of any client situation, and to generate innovative answers to complex questions. We want people with the ability to think in logical, structured ways, together with the creativity to look beyond the obvious. We recruit from a wide range of disciplines in both the arts and sciences, and do not require existing technical skills – just a strong desire to learn.

Our team-oriented approach requires individuals who can collaborate and communicate well. We seek proactive, energetic, and enthusiastic candidates who take ownership of their work and make a meaningful impact.

What We Offer

Training and development

The Associate position at L.E.K. is a launch-pad for your career. As a new Associate you will be supported with a comprehensive initial two-week orientation programme, followed by thorough monthly training sessions designed to complement your on-the-job experience. These cover the full range of skills needed to develop and progress your career within L.E.K., allowing promotion to the Consultant role without attaining an MBA. For those who go on to pursue roles in industry or Private Equity, the highly valuable commercial and analytical skill set, and broad commercial experience of an L.E.K. Associate are in great demand.

International Experience And Exchange Programme

L.E.K. offers you the opportunity to swap to one of our global offices for six months. This is a popular way to experience a different business environment, gain exposure to new industries and specialisms and experience a different culture. In addition, you will often work with colleagues from other offices, on projects with an international scope.

Application Process

Our application process is now open for positions starting in March 2026.

Please upload your application documents (cover letter, CV, references) on our career site by clicking the ""Apply"" button.

After completing the online application process, selected candidates will be contacted by our Recruitment Team and invited to a numerical reasoning test followed by a series of interviews. Applicants stating 'fluency' in a language will have this assessed during the recruitment process. Please note that fluency in both German and English are a requirement for this position.

We are looking forward to receiving your application!

Diversity and inclusion at L.E.K.

Here at L.E.K., we appreciate the value of a diverse and inclusive workforce and are committed to a culture that is inclusive and accepting of all people. Above all, we are committed to ensuring that all employees are treated with respect and dignity. L.E.K. Consulting is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

We have several affinity groups to support and enrich our employees and in addition, our Diversity and Inclusion committee celebrate events throughout the year with a focus on awareness and education.

La satisfaction d’être reconnu pour son travail et d’évoluer dans une bonne ambiance

Geoffroy, Consultant Expert – Practice Finance Quantitative

Après des études en Ingénierie et un Master de Recherche en Nanotechnologie, j’ai travaillé dans les secteurs de l’Energie et du Retail, au sein de cabinets de conseil / ESN du Big Four. Puis j’ai rejoint Quanteam, en 2018, en tant que Développeur Full Stack sur des problématiques de produits structurés et produits exotiques au sein d’une grande banque française. J’avais déjà le souhait de m’orienter vers le secteur de la Banque / Finance, sur lequel j’avais commencé à me former, et j’ai été rassuré de voir que, à travers son process de recrutement sélectif, Quanteam était un acteur incontournable du marché. Dès le début, j’ai senti le soutien du cabinet dans l’accompagnement de ses consultants, via la formation. Grâce à Quanteam, j’ai d’ailleurs pu renforcer mes compétences à travers un Master en Finance Quantitative, en cours du soir, qui m’a permis d’intégrer la Practice Quant et de conjuguer mes compétences techniques à ma compréhension des problématiques Métiers, Business et Fonctionnelles.

Je souhaitais rejoindre un acteur du conseil en Banque / Finance

Salim, Senior Business Manager chez Quanteam

J’ai choisi de rejoindre le cabinet en 2020 et je suis très heureux d’y occuper un poste complet au sein d’une entreprise humaine, qui favorise la montée en compétences et qui sait reconnaitre le travail accompli. Il y a une vraie émulsion entre les équipes ainsi qu’une bonne ambiance qu’on retrouve au quotidien ou lors des afterworks et des évènements du cabinet. La proximité que nous entretenons soigneusement avec nos clients ainsi que nos consultants est à l’image de celle qui existe en interne avec les équipes et avec la direction. Plus que tout, j’ai le sentiment que le travail est reconnu à sa juste valeur et qu’il a un impact direct sur l’évolution de carrière.

J’ai toujours eu des missions géniales chez QUANTEAM

François, Consultant Manager – Practice Finance Quantitative

Ingénieur de formation, j’ai rejoint les équipes de Quanteam il y a plus de 10 ans, après une expérience mitigée dans un cabinet de conseil concurrent. C’est la mission proposée qui m’a attiré en premier lieu (support pre-trade en salle de marché) , mais ce sont les valeurs humaines et l’accompagnement dont fait preuve le cabinet qui m’a fait rester. J’ai toujours eu des missions géniales chez Quanteam. J’ai pu rejoidre le bureau de Londres, pendant plusieurs mois, et j’ai évolué grâce aux nombreuses opportunités de postes internes. Quanteam est très bien référencé chez nos clients et le cabinet propose de belles missions, avec de beaux challenges techniques et fonctionnels. Pour ceux qui attendent plus qu’une simple mission de la part d’un cabinet, Quanteam est l’endroit idéal.

De belles missions dans le secteur Bancaire et une proximité dès les premiers échanges

Ghaoutia, Consultante Manager – Practice Transformation et Organisation

Après un passage au sein de plusieurs cabinets de conseil et ESN, essentiellement sur des missions de chefferie / direction de Projets MOA, j’ai rejoint Quanteam en 2021. J’avais une très belle proposition côté éditeur, mais j’ai rapidement senti un feeling humain et une sensation de bienveillance lors de mes premiers échanges avec Quanteam, qui ont fait la différence et qui m’ont convaincue de rejoindre le cabinet. La qualité et la diversité des missions proposées dans le secteur Bancaire, domaine de prédilection du cabinet, étaient également un atout non négligeable pour moi. J’ai d’ailleurs pu réaliser deux belles missions (direction de projets et de conseil) et j’ai pu coacher des consultants en amont de leurs entretiens de missions. Deux ans après, je ne regrette pas mon choix. Je retrouve cette proximité et cette volonté de collaborer, au quotidien, notamment avec l’équipe commerciale mais également au sein des équipes projets.

Chacun peut trouver sa place et évoluer

Marc, Chef de projet MOA chez Quanteam / co-directeur de la Practice Operations & Finance

Je suis consultant depuis plus de 20 ans, au sein de différentes Banques et Assurances. J’ai rejoint le bureau parisien de Quanteam il y a 7 ans car j’ai apprécié les valeurs humaines lors des premières rencontres, valeurs que je partage au quotidien. La direction reste également très accessible et transparente dans ses échanges avec les collaborateurs du cabinet, comme ce fut le cas lors de la période COVID. Ce qui est d’autant plus appréciable que ce n’a pas été le cas partout. Enfin, les missions proposées diversifiées et variées permettent à chacun et chacune de s’enrichir professionnellement et personnellement.

La liberté de choisir ses missions est très appréciable

Mathieu, Consultant Manager – Practice Transformation et Organisation

J’ai rejoint Quanteam en 2019, après plusieurs expériences dans le conseil, en tant qu’Analyste Equity Derivatives, puis comme Chef de Projets IT. J’occupe aujourd’hui un rôle de Scrum Master / BA au sein d’une équipe anti-fraude. Ce qui me plaît chez Quanteam, c’est la richesse et la diversité des missions proposées, et la forte implantation du cabinet sur les secteurs bancaires et financiers. Le cabinet écoute les souhaits de ses consultants et leurs donne le choix des missions, ce qui n’est pas le cas partout. En termes d’évolution, j’ai souhaité intégrer la Practice Transformation et Organisation afin d’acquérir de nouvelles compétences, grâce aux experts qui la compose. J’ai réalisé plusieurs formations certifiantes, ce qui me donne vraiment l’impression que le cabinet investi sur moi.

🏆 The Opportunity 🏆

We are looking for an entrepreneurial Chief of Staff to own and drive strategic initiatives that shape the future of cargo.one. You will be a high trust operator to the Founders and SLT - solving critical problems, launching new bets, and designing and levelling up the systems that scale our business. This opportunity is for a builder - someone who is comfortable with the unknown and ambiguity, can make things happen and values impact. You will graduate from this role with the track record, experience, and mentorship to build your own company or own a strategic domain at cargo.one, as others in this role have done before you.

This is a unique, entrepreneurial opportunity to be working alongside our successful three time founders and global team to drive the digitalization of air freight and logistics in a fast-growing Series B company backed by leading Venture Capital firms including Index and Bessemer.

🌍 This is a fully remote role so you can work from a permanent location (almost) anywhere within 2 hours of CET. See which countries we can employ in currently by checking out this list here. In Berlin? You are welcome to join us at our Moritzplatz office. Elsewhere? You can work from home or a local coworking space via our partner and we will fly you in for regular company offsites.

We foster a positive, dynamic, hard-working and feedback-heavy culture, with a strong dose of playfulness. Join us now and transform air cargo!

🎬 A snapshot of what you will be doing here:


Be the right hand to the Founders and SLT, acting as a force multiplier across strategic, operational, and execution priorities.
Identify, scope, and lead high-priority projects across departments - e.g. launching new business models, improving operational efficiency, managing OKR cycles and alignment, or solving cross-functional friction points.
Analyze data, spot opportunities, and frame crisp decisions for our leadership team and board.
Build the business and systems that scale - from internal operating cadences to tooling and knowledge systems.
Work directly with the CEO on communication and relationship building with current and future investors.
Partner cross functionally with Product, Partnerships, Commercial, People and Finance to align the company around what matters most - and make it happen.


🕵 We are looking for individuals with:


5+ years of experience in fast-paced and high-performance work environments like VC-backed start-ups or top-tier consulting.
Builder mindset - you have a bias to action and love of execution, and thrive in solving problems and clearing blocker to deliver impact.
Exceptional analytical skills - you’re comfortable with Excel, SQL, dashboards and turning noise into signal.
Extensive project management experience driving complex and cross functional initiatives.
Low ego, high output - you care about outcomes over optics, you earn trust quickly, and you get things done even when the path isn’t clear.
Outstanding communication - you can distill complex issues into simple narratives, influence without authority, and get buy-in at all levels.
A demonstrated ability to apply new technologies to solve problems.


❤️ We think you will love working here if:


You are a builder, are hungry to drive change and have impact
You value building great relationships and trust with your team and managers.
You thrive in the unknown - from experimenting and iterating new ideas, from dealing with ambiguity and finding opportunity in the unknown
In everything you do, you take ownership and get a kick out of exceeding expectations.
When faced with the choice, you’d rather opt for the ambitious to ensure you grow, than take the easy option.
You see the value of giving and receiving feedback and incorporate this into everything you do.
You are not afraid to voice your opinions and like using data to back them up
You see working remotely successfully as a pioneering challenge which is constantly evolving.


🤔 What is so exciting about working in the air cargo industry?

Imagine trying to book a holiday without Skyscanner or Kayak—that’s exactly the challenge facing the air cargo industry today. Despite being a $182bn global market, air cargo is still dominated by manual, time-consuming processes. We’re changing that. Backed by leading international investors, we’re building the tech platform that brings transparency and instant booking to airlines and freight forwarders worldwide.

You’ll join a truly international team, working with partners and customers across the globe, and help drive the digital transformation of one of the last major industries yet to modernize. If you want to have a real impact at the forefront of change, we’d love to hear from you.
