However, steep entry barriers, including high minimum investments (~€10m), hefty paperwork and the challenge of selecting the right fund have traditionally kept individual investors at bay, with access largely limited to big institutions or a select few.

Enter Moonfare.




We've made investing in private equity more accessible and straightforward with our fully digital investment platform. Now, qualified investors can access some of the most sought-after private market funds at lower minimum investment amounts*.




The diverse Moonfare team – which includes alumni from top private banks, groundbreaking startups and beyond – is united in pushing boundaries and redefining the private equity landscape.




Join us!

You will shape how we understand performance, measure success, and identify new opportunities across the company. Your work will help ensure that decisions at Moonfare are always backed by clear, well structured, and meaningful data.




You will:

Develop and maintain advanced SQL-based data models to power business reporting and analysis

Perform exploratory and strategic analysis to support product launches, marketing campaigns, and commercial initiatives
Partner closely with product managers, marketing, and business stakeholders to understand goals and define relevant KPIs

Advocate for data quality and consistency, ensuring models and reporting are accurate, well documented, and easily understood
Collaborate with the wider data and analytics team to improve data infrastructure and analytics tooling
Drive initiatives that increase data literacy and empower teams to use data more effectively




The next Moonfarian:

Has 5–7 years of experience as a Data, Product, or Marketing Analyst
Has a proven track record of transforming data infrastructure and metrics to support business growth
Possesses advanced SQL skills (BigQuery, PostgreSQL), along with strong Spreadsheet and Tableau proficiency; experience with dbt and Snowflake is a plus
Has hands-on experience working with commercial, product, or marketing datasets
Is comfortable designing and interpreting A/B tests and leading experimentation efforts
Collaborates effectively across both technical and non-technical teams
Communicates clearly, takes ownership, and is passionate about driving business impact through data




If you feel you do not meet all of the requirements, we still encourage you to apply!




Our Values:

Our clients come first, Moonfare comes second, and we prioritise ourselves third - Client-Centric Focus. Putting clients first means creating value for them is essential. Placing Moonfare second signifies that our individual professional future at Moonfare depends on the company's commercial success. Prioritising ourselves third reflects our humility in putting clients and Moonfare before personal interests.
We pursue excellence and honor our promises - Commitment to Excellence. We hold ourselves to the highest standards, taking responsibility for our failures, and celebrating our successes. We commit to deadlines and stick to them and we learn from our mistakes.
We are here to win and to celebrate our collective achievements - Win together. We are mission-focused and think and act like owners. We exemplify the attitude we expect and each of us commits to do what it takes to succeed.
We foster personal growth but each of us earns our place as a Moonfarian through merit - Growth and Merit. We hire, retain, and develop exceptional people and invest in empowering them to excel. We must all earn our place at the table every day.




We understand the important role that diversity plays in our success. Different backgrounds, experiences and ideas push us further and raise the bar. We’re committed to developing an inclusive and safe culture where everyone — regardless of colour, race, religion, sex, origin, sexuality, disability, marital status, citizenship or gender identity — knows that they are an integral part of the team and can bring their full potential to their work.

With deep expertise in product and technology, we built Homa Lab, our proprietary platform that gives developers the market intelligence, data tools, and game tech, with AI built-in, to find product-market fit fast and scale mass-market games into lasting experiences players enjoy for years.

Since the start, we've raised $165M from Headline, Northzone, Eurazeo, Bpifrance, and the founders of King, Sorare, and Spotify, people who've built and backed the games and platforms we admire, now supporting our drive to create the next ones.

Payrails is a global payment software company helping leading enterprises to take control of their payment operations and maximize performance. With deep experience in the payments space and firsthand knowledge of merchants' challenges, we’ve seen how fragmented, complex, and inefficient these systems can become. Now, we are setting a new industry standard for how enterprises around the world manage and optimize payments, with more control, visibility and flexibility than ever before.

Our vision is to reimagine payments from the ground up. We are building a deeply integrated meta layer that spans the entire payment lifecycle with a modular architecture. This helps us give leading brands building blocks to craft solutions to most complex operational challenges, tailor seamless customer experiences and grow their business.

We are backed by some of the world’s top investors including Andreessen Horowitz, HV Capital, EQT Ventures and General Catalyst, who share our mission to simplify payment complexity globally.

At Payrails, we’re committed to building a team of exceptional people - not just talented, but driven to build, solve, and deliver at the highest level. Excellence isn’t just a value here; it’s a way of working. We believe that great people thrive in environments where there’s trust, clarity, and shared purpose. We work openly and collaboratively, with deep respect for each other’s craft. Everyone is encouraged to understand the bigger picture - what we’re building, why it matters, and what stands in the way. When people have that context, they move faster, take ownership, and make better decisions. We care about creating a culture where people feel inspired to do their best work and a deep sense of responsibility to help us bring our vision to life. Success at Payrails means staying focused on the problems that matter most, and executing with purpose.

About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

Job Description

We are on the lookout for a Staff Product Analyst to join the Consumer Product Analytics team on our journey to always deliver amazing experiences.

At Delivery Hero, you’ll shape the global consumer experience for millions of users. Your work will have a direct impact on how we attract and retain customers, creating data-driven, personalized interactions that keep them coming back. As part of our Consumer Team, you’ll enhance customer satisfaction and drive global growth and profitability through innovative projects.

The Consumer Product Analytics Team drives product strategy and innovation by providing actionable insights on customers and products, contributing to business success. In this role, you'll have the opportunity to shape the experience for millions of users across our worldwide portfolio of platforms (FoodPanda, Pedidos Ya, Woowa, Yemeksepeti, Foodora, Talabat, HungerStation, eFood, and Glovo), directly impacting customer satisfaction and driving growth. Our diverse team of data professionals is based in Berlin, working closely with product directors, product managers, engineers, and business stakeholders to directly influence product direction. We collaborate with a larger data team, including data engineers, data scientists, and ML engineers, to share knowledge and expertise.

At Consumer Product Analytics, you will have the opportunity to access high volume, rich user behavior data, engage in end to end product development cycles, work on complex product problems, and learn from many experienced data professionals.

The main responsibilities of the Product Analytics Team include:


Strategic Impact & Product Leadership: Act as a key strategic data partner to product leadership, influencing product roadmap and investment decisions through deep analytical insights and foresight. Proactively identify high-impact analytical opportunities to drive significant customer satisfaction and business growth.
Advanced Experimentation & Causal Inference: Design, implement, and rigorously analyze A/B tests and other experimental designs (e.g., multi-variate, quasi-experiments) with a strong emphasis on advanced statistical methods for robust hypothesis validation, accurate impact measurement, and understanding causal relationships. Drive the standardization and continuous improvement of our experimentation framework across multiple brands.
Metric Framework & OKR Ownership: Define, establish, and own comprehensive product metric frameworks and quarterly OKRs. Drive alignment on ""what good looks like"" across product teams, ensuring clear, measurable goals that align with strategic business outcomes.
Data Integrity & Tracking Excellence: Take ownership of tracking definition and work closely with various Delivery Hero brands to significantly improve the reliability, consistency, and completeness of user behavior tracking for our discovery tools. Proactively identify and resolve data quality issues at scale.
Scalable ETL & Reporting Solutions: Design, build, and maintain robust data pipelines and self-service dashboards, ensuring data accessibility and empowering product teams to make data-driven decisions independently.
Deep Dive & Exploratory Analysis: Conduct complex, end-to-end exploratory analyses on large-scale user behavior data (transactional, clickstream, etc.) to uncover non-obvious insights, identify root causes of trends, and directly inform product strategy and roadmap development.
Technical & Mentorship Leadership: Contribute significantly to the growth and development of fellow product analysts through knowledge sharing sessions, best practice dissemination, workflow optimizations, and active participation in hiring and onboarding processes. Champion and drive analytical excellence within the team and broader organization.


Qualifications


9+ years of experience in product analytics or a related data-focused role, preferably within rapidly growing and dynamic environments, and with a broad mission scope or multiple stakeholders.
Experience working in Search & Recommendations systems.
Expert proficiency in SQL and Python for complex data manipulation, analysis, and modeling. Experience with BigQuery and large-scale cloud data warehousing concepts is a strong plus.
Expertise in statistical methods applied to experimental design (A/B testing, multivariate tests, etc.), causal inference, and robust hypothesis validation. You should be able to navigate complex statistical challenges and explain methodologies clearly.
Extensive experience working with large-scale user behavior data (e.g., transactional, clickstream, app usage), including data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to derive actionable insights.
Proficiency with at least one data visualization tool such as Looker Studio (Data Studio), Tableau, QlikView, or Power BI, with a proven ability to create compelling and insightful dashboards.
Demonstrated ability to influence and collaborate with multiple stakeholders, including senior product managers, engineers, and business leaders. You can clearly communicate complex analytical findings and successfully drive large-scale analytics projects end-to-end (e.g., defining success metrics for a tribe, standardizing measurement across brands, or implementing new experimentation methodologies).
Experience with customer behavior tracking platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, MixPanel, Snowplow, Segment, Tealium).


Nice to have:


Experience with Airflow, DBT, or other data pipelining tools
Familiarity with recommender systems, ML models, or ranking algorithms
Experience scaling analytics processes or experimentation programs across multiple teams or brands.

Wir sind ein zukunftsorientiertes Unternehmen mit einem motiviertem Team, erfolgreichen Produkten und ambitionierten Zielen. Mit unseren Stärken in IT und effizienten Prozessen verändern wir die Energiebranche.

Wir suchen Dich unbefristet zum nächstmöglichen Zeitpunkt für die Abteilung Finance im Team BI & Reporting Automation als BI Manager (Mensch).

Unsere BI-Strategie ist ein zentraler Treiber für die Skalierung unseres Unternehmens. Sie schafft Transparenz, fördert datenbasierte Entscheidungen und verbindet operative Exzellenz mit strategischer Weitsicht. In dieser Rolle gestaltest Du aktiv mit, wie wir Daten sinnvoll strukturieren, verständlich visualisieren und strategisch einsetzen.

Deine Aufgaben Im Detail


Du entwickelst, gestaltest und pflegst interaktive Dashboards und Reports mit Microsoft Power BI sowie weiteren BI-Tools.
Du analysierst komplexe Datensätze, erkennst Muster, Trends und leitest daraus konkrete Handlungsempfehlungen für das Business ab.
Du arbeitest eng mit verschiedenen Stakeholdern zusammen und übersetzt Business-Anforderungen in smarte Datenlösungen.
Du stellst sicher, dass Datenqualität, -integrität und -konsistenz (Data Governance) über alle Quellen hinweg gewährleistet sind.
Du optimierst Datenmodelle, Abfragen und Visualisierungen, sodass Insights schnell und verständlich verfügbar sind.
Du bringst Dich aktiv bei der Weiterentwicklung unserer Datenstrategie, Data Governance und BI-Best Practices ein.


Deine Tätigkeit kannst Du entweder in unserem Berliner Office oder ganz bequem von zu Hause aus (mobiles Arbeiten bzw. Homeoffice) ausführen.


Du hast einen Studienabschluss in einem relevanten Bereich, z. B. Mathematik, Statistik, (Wirtschafts-)Informatik oder einem verwandten Fachgebiet.
Du bringst bereits fundierte Erfahrung als Data Analyst oder im BI-Umfeld mit und kannst komplexe Daten klar strukturieren und interpretieren.
Du bist fit in Microsoft Power BI (DAX, Power Query, Datenmodellierung) und kennst Dich idealerweise auch mit weiteren BI-/Visualisierungstools (z. B. Tableau) sowie Python aus.
Du verfügst über solides SQL-Wissen und hast Erfahrung im Umgang mit Data Warehouses.
Du verstehst Datenarchitekturen, ETL-Prozesse und die Prinzipien von Data Governance.
Du kommunizierst klar und überzeugend - sowohl auf Deutsch als auch auf Englisch - und kannst Insights verständlich auf den Punkt bringen.
Du bist detailorientiert, proaktiv und behältst auch in einem dynamischen Umfeld mehrere Themen im Blick.
In der interdisziplinären Zusammenarbeit zeigst Du Teamgeist, Offenheit und die Fähigkeit, gemeinsam tragfähige Lösungen zu entwickeln.


Wir sind uns bewusst, dass kaum ein Profil alle Anforderungen vollständig abdecken kann. Wenn Du bereit bist, Dich fachlich weiterzuentwickeln und bereits erste einschlägige Erfahrungen mitbringst, bist Du bei uns ebenso richtig!

Mit deinem Lächeln und einem professionellen Auftreten begrüßt du unsere Gäste und sorgst dafür, dass ihr Aufenthalt bei uns reibungslos verläuft.

Anstellungsart: Vollzeit

Als Empfangsmitarbeiter oder –mitarbeiterin bewältigst du mit Gelassenheit und organisatorischem Geschick die vielfältigen Aufgaben, die täglich auf dich zukommen. Du bist ein kommunikationsfreudiges Organisationstalent, das mit Leidenschaft neue Ideen einbringt und die Qualität am Front Office sicherstellt.

Die Rolle Umfasst


Gästebegrüßung, Check-in & Check out:Du bist der Sonnenschein, der die Gäste mit einem Lächeln begrüßt und ihnen das Gefühl gibt, herzlich willkommen zu sein. Du sorgst dafür, dass die Gäste ihren Besuch bei uns problemlos beenden können, rechnest ab und hilfst bei Fragen oder Anliegen.
Information und Beratung: An der Rezeption bist die Anlaufstelle für alle Fragen und Anliegen der Gäste, sei es bezüglich der besten Restaurants, Sehenswürdigkeiten oder Aktivitäten in der Umgebung. Dein Ziel ist es, den Aufenthalt der Gäste unvergesslich zu gestalten, indem du ihnen wertvolle Ratschläge und Empfehlungen gibst.
Reservierung:Du jonglierst mit Buchungsanfragen und gewährleistest, dass die Bedürfnisse und Wünsche der Gäste in Bezug auf ihren Aufenthalt bei uns erfüllt werden. Deine Fähigkeiten im Reservierungsmanagement tragen dazu bei, jedem Gast ein maßgeschneidertes und unvergessliches Erlebnis zu bieten.
Beschwerdemanagement:Manchmal gibt es kleine Stolpersteine. Du bist der Problemlöser, der Beschwerden in ein Lächeln verwandelt.
Kassenführung:Du behältst stets den finanziellen Überblick und sorgst dafür, dass alle Buchungen und Transaktionen korrekt und präzise erfasst werden. Deine Genauigkeit und Verlässlichkeit sind hierbei von großer Bedeutung.


Wir bei Seminaris lieben die Veränderung. Deshalb geben wir nicht nur innerhalb unseres Aufgabengebiets unser Bestes, sondern wollen unsere Organisation jeden Tag zum Besseren verändern. Als Front Office Agent (m/w/d) wünschen wir uns deshalb passionierte Teamplayer, die offen sind für neue Arbeitsweisen und interessiert an fachlichem und persönlichem Wachstum.

Was Wir Uns Zusätzlich Wünschen


Qualifikation:Du verfügst über eine abgeschlossene Berufsausbildung als Hotelfachfrau oder Hotelfachmann und bringst erste Berufserfahrung als Rezeptionist oder Rezeptionistin mit. Die Abläufe rund um Buchung, Check-in und Rechnungsstellung sind dir vertraut. Das Arbeiten mit einer Hotelsoftware (Sihot von Vorteil) und Reservierungssystem ist dir nicht neu.
Hospitality: Du stehst unseren Gästen mit deiner offenen und herzlichen Art mit Rat und Tat zur Seite und ziehst die größte Motivation daraus, wenn der Gast am Ende strahlend unser Haus verlässt. Deine aufrichtige Herzlichkeit und starke Empathie befähigen dich, dich in die Lage der Gäste zu versetzen und ihre Bedürfnisse zu verstehen.
Kommunikationsfähigkeiten:Du kannst mit deinem Lächeln und deiner freundlichen Art jeden überzeugen. Du bist ein Teamplayer und arbeitest gerne und proaktiv mit anderen Abteilungen zusammen. Gute mündliche Sprachkenntnisse in Deutsch und Englisch sind uns wichtig.
Nachhaltigkeitsinteresse:Du zeigst Interesse an Nachhaltigkeit in ökologischer, sozialer und prozessualer Hinsicht und möchtest dazu beitragen, nachhaltige Praktiken in unserem Unternehmen zu fördern.


Onboarding bei Seminaris findet auf sehr persönlichem Weg statt. Mit einem Buddy an deiner Seite lernst du vom ersten Tag an, wie wir ticken und die Unternehmenskultur leben. Dabei ist dein Buddy nicht nur bei der Einarbeitung an deiner Seite, sondern begegnet dir bereits im Kennlerngespräch.

Warum Seminaris: Beste Bedingungen für neue, gute Arbeit

Bei Seminaris glauben wir daran, dass man Hotellerie auch anders machen kann: nachhaltig, transformierend und mit unseren Mitarbeitenden im Zentrum. Wir schaffen Räume zum Wachsen, für dich, für uns, unsere Partner und Gäste. Das ist unser Benefit - ein echter Mehrwert für (d)ein persönliches und fachliches Wachsen.

Dazu Gehören Ebenso


Flexible & hybride Arbeitszeitmodelle: Dein Vertrag wird für deinen Arbeitsbereich individuell und bedarfsorientiert ausgestaltet, damit er zu deinem Leben passt.
Teilhabe & Mitsprache: Unsere interne Transformation wird von den Mitarbeitenden getragen – auch du kannst Teil unseres übergreifenden Transformations-Teams werden und Seminaris mitgestalten!
Moderne Unternehmenskultur: Unsere gelebten Werte Kommunikationsfreude, Selbstbestimmtheit, Wertschätzung und Teamstärke sorgen für ein positives Arbeitsklima.
Verantwortung & Nachhaltigkeit: Bei uns finden deine Ideale ein Zuhause: Wir arbeiten sozial und ökologisch nachhaltig, wir achten auf einen respektvollen Umgang mit Mensch und Natur.
Individuelle Lernreise: Neben deiner fachlichen Weiterentwicklung bieten wir dir zahlreiche Möglichkeiten, um deine Potenziale zu entdecken und dich persönlich zu entfalten.
Wohlbefinden: Selbstverständlich kannst du jedes unserer Häuser auch privat zu Top-Konditionen genießen.

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Sound like something you’d like to be a part of? We’d love to hear from you!

This position may require access to information protected under U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations.

Job Description

Location:

London, GB

Condé Nast is a global media company, home to iconic brands including Vogue, GQ, Glamour, CN Traveller, Vanity Fair, Wired, The World of Interiors, House & Garden and Tatler, among many others.

We are headquartered in New York and London and operate in 32 markets worldwide, with a footprint of more than 1 billion consumers across print, digital, video and social platforms.

Condé Nast thrives on collaboration, and our teams come together in the office four days a week (Monday - Thursday).

We value diversity of background, views and cultures. We celebrate people for their personal qualities, skills and contributions, recognising the power our brands have to influence and shape culture.

The Role

The Data Analyst is a key role in the European Consumer Revenue team. We are a recently formed department covering five markets (UK, Germany, Spain, France and Italy), focused on growing and building diversified consumer revenue streams (including print and digital subscriptions, newsstands, Commerce, Memberships and new and emerging direct to consumer opportunities). The customer is at the heart of everything we do and we are of course incredibly passionate about delivering propositions that meet the varied consumer needs for our brands. We are advocates of using data in our decision making - and believe that multivariate testing, customer insight and journey funnel analysis is at the heartbeat of a successful business. We are looking for two new Data Analysts (both new roles) and so if you are bright, dynamic, ready to roll your sleeves up and want to quickly see the results of your hard work, then please get in touch - and we're confident you’ll enjoy working within our growing team!

The Data Analyst is responsible for ensuring we accurately report on all our revenue streams - and moreover, conduct analysis to provide insight and recommendations to support continuous optimisation and improvement across all of our KPIs. Your role will have a considerable impact on the success of the business and your analysis will range from acquisition, churn, conversion rates, average order size, clickstream data, consumer behaviour, multivariate testing, segmentation, etc. We're in the early stages of transforming our Consumer Revenue business and you will be at the forefront of what will fuel continuous improvement - supplying data and reporting that will significantly influence key decision making, both on a long-term strategic level and in successfully delivering short tactical optimisation opportunities.

To be successful in this role you must be commercial and numerate. You are likely to have had operational experience of working in a B2C internet or eCommerce business, although we are equally open to Graduates who can demonstrate a good knowledge of digital. You have a good understanding of online marketing and a real interest in user journey experience. Ultimately though, you are passionate about data and a real advocate of ""if you can't measure it, don't do it"".

What will you be doing?


You will create comprehensive dashboards by integrating data from a variety of different data sources and distribute with insight and commentary to key stakeholders
You will analyse performance and customer behaviour to deliver insight and improvement recommendations to cover online journeys, online and offline campaigns, cross-sell activity, sales funnel analysis, CustSat, etc


Who you are:


You are analytic, inquisitive and have a huge thirst for data
You are of course naturally numerate and advanced in Excel – and therefore you probably have a degree in Maths, Computer Science, Economics, or in a similar field
Should you have experience or knowledge of other key analytical tools and systems (SQL, Python, Business Objects, Tableau, etc) that would be beneficial, but not essential
You have the ability to identify trends and analysis through reading data, but equally can support your analysis with excellent verbal and written communication skills
You have an inclination for problem-solving and are a strong communicator, who can explain trend analysis and potentially complicated data analysis both verbally and by means of a written report
You are highly collaborative and recognise that you will ultimately only be successful by working as a team - both in terms of your direct team colleagues and cross-functionally across the business.


Does this sound like you?

Please upload your CV and cover letter/portfolio, which highlights why you'd love to take on this role and why you're a great match for what we're looking for.

We value the time and effort behind every application. All submissions are reviewed by a member of our talent team - we don’t use AI-assisted technology to review applications.

What benefits do we offer?


25 days holiday (plus bank holidays) and extra days of annual leave if you move house or want to volunteer.
You’ll have access to a competitive pension scheme, Bupa Private Healthcare, Season ticket loans and eye tests.
We offer a range of tools to support your wellbeing, including core hours, 10 remote days (from home or a country with a Condé Nast office location), access to our Employee Assistance Programme, corporate gym membership and cycle to work scheme.
We’re a dog friendly office, plus you’ll enjoy discounts and magazine subscriptions, keeping you up to date with all things Condé Nast.
We encourage personal and professional growth through the Condé Nast Learning Hub where you’ll find an extensive portfolio of learning courses and training, available in local languages.
Our Employee Resource Groups provide a platform for employees to identify shared objectives, exchange ideas, and work on community priorities for our global workforce.

At Dines, our mission is simple yet powerful: to serve those who serve. We empower hospitality businesses with a cutting-edge POS and payments platform, helping renowned festivals, events, theatres, and restaurants across the UK and Ireland operate seamlessly.

We’re more than just a technology provider – we’re a trusted partner built on three pillars: Relationships, Service, and Delivery. Our clients love us because we genuinely have their backs, and we take pride in being there when they need us most.

You’ll collaborate with developers, clients, and internal teams to ensure data integrity, uncover insights, and help businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions. Accuracy, curiosity, and problem-solving will be key to your success here.

Build dashboards & reports – Use QuickSight and other tools to simplify complex data for clients.
Investigate customer data queries – Provide clear, accurate resolutions to client concerns.
Support internal teams – Deliver insights to improve company strategies and decision-making.
Write & refine SQL queries – Manage large datasets efficiently to extract meaningful insights.


Who We're Looking For


Detail-oriented – You ensure data is accurate and reliable.
Problem-solver – You thrive on tackling complex challenges.
Curious & proactive – Always seeking better ways and fresh insights.
Clear communicator – Able to turn data into stories everyone understands.
Adaptable & independent – Comfortable in a fast-moving environment.
Collaborative – A team player who works well across functions.
Analytically strong – Skilled in SQL and data analysis.
Passionate about learning – F&B knowledge or experience helps, but enthusiasm for data matters most.


Why Join Dines?

Generous Leave: 30 days plus eight public holidays (five of which are flexible).
Personal Budgets: Invest in your well-being, learning, and workspace.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.

To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Collaborate with Product and Business teams to determine the most pressing questions that big data can help answer, and then figure out how to uncover those insights.
Query and analyze massive sets of usage data to identify product-improvement opportunities and actionable insights to profoundly impact our product strategy and roadmap.
Create brief, high-quality reports to explain your findings and discuss their implications with the relevant team members.
Screen the app stores and study competing products in search of insights and ideas we could learn from.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field.


What we look for
Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.


What we offer
Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. For a candidate that we assess as possessing considerable relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.


Commitment & contract
Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time or part-time.

Location
Milan (Italy), London (UK).

The selection process
If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests designed to assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. They’re challenging and may take several hours to complete. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.

We set the bar high and won't extend an offer until we're convinced we've found the right candidate. This is why a job may stay open for months or be reposted several times.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and provide reasonable accommodations for an individual with disabilities—just let us know through this form.

Before you apply
If you’ve applied before but didn't receive an offer, we recommend waiting at least one year before applying again.

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment. We’re extremely ambitious and we hold ourselves—and one another—to a high standard. While this tends to lead to extraordinary learning, achievement, and career growth, it also requires significant commitment.

To help you ramp up quickly and set yourself up for success, we recommend spending your first few months working from our Milan office, regardless of your long-term work location. It’s the best way to rapidly absorb our company culture and build trust with your new teammates. We’ll support you with generous travel and accommodation assistance. After that, you’re welcome to work from our offices in Milan or London, or remotely from approved countries—depending on what we agree at the offer stage.

If the role speaks to you and you’re excited to give your best, we’d love to hear from you. Apply now—we can’t wait to meet you.

This is your chance to step into a career that grows as you grow.

Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location.

Perform ad hoc data analysis, reporting, and data mining to support business inquiries and decision-making.

Act as a ""Product Owner"" for the reporting domain: manage incoming data and reporting requests, prioritize needs, and collaborate with engineering to implement scalable, automated solutions.
Identify and analyze trends and patterns in data to inform product enhancements and develop strategies for increasing client engagement.
Present findings and actionable recommendations clearly and effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, fostering understanding and supporting data-driven decision-making.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to align analytics initiatives with broader business strategies and objectives.

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements



Travel:-

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility.

Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-

Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements

We love what we do, and have the ability to profoundly impact millions of people's lives every single day! Named one of BC’s Top Employers, Plenty of Fish is a great place to build friendships, grow your career and collaborate with top talent.

Proficiency in SQL, and experience using Python for advanced analytics
Strong business acumen and product intuition—you understand the “why” behind the data
Excellent communication skills, you’re confident presenting insights to cross-functional teams and leadership
Comfortable working in gray areas, self-starting, and taking initiative without waiting for explicit direction

The Position

Uplight is creating a new category of energy. We make software that manages energy resources in homes and businesses—including things like smart thermostats, electric vehicles, solar panels, storage batteries, heat pumps, and even people’s behavior—to generate, shift, or save energy to balance the grid, making it more efficient and reliable. This creates clean energy capacity that can be used by the power grid instead of burning more fossil fuels. Our solutions accelerate the transition to clean energy and save money for energy customers.

We are seeking a Data Engineer focusing on data platform enablement to support our mission and scale our impact

How You Will Make An Impact

As a Data Engineer at Uplight, you’ll play a central role in designing and maintaining the infrastructure that ingests, transforms, and delivers data across our platform. Your work ensures that data systems are reliable, scalable, observable, and cost-efficient—forming the backbone of many customer-facing and data science-driven solutions.

You’ll partner with cross-functional teams including analysts, product managers, and data scientists to ensure the platform meets the evolving needs of our business and our users.

What You Get To Do


Design, build, and maintain data pipelines using Databricks (Spark, Delta Lake) and Python.
Collaborate across teams to develop core platform capabilities—such as orchestration, metadata management, and data quality—delivering scalable, reusable solutions
Improve reliability and fault tolerance of ingest pipelines handling large volumes of utility data.
Build and support MLOps tooling, including data pipelines, model registries, and serving infrastructure
Participate in the full software development lifecycle: design, build, test, deploy, and support
Contribute to a remote-first team that values agility, collaboration, and clarity—favoring whiteboarding, async design docs, and reflective retros over rigid ceremonies.
Continuously learn and grow with support from senior engineers and team leads
Help maintain a team culture rooted in curiosity, empathy, and continuous improvement


What You Bring To Uplight


2–5 years of software engineering experience, ideally in backend or data-focused roles
Experience with Databricks, Spark, or similar big data technologies
Proficiency in Python and SQL
Exposure to cloud platforms such as GCP or AWS
Familiarity with CI/CD tools and infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Docker, Terraform, CircleCI)
Strong communication and collaboration skills; a team player excited to learn and grow


Bonus Points


Familiarity with MLOps concepts and tools (e.g., MLflow, model versioning)
Experience with real-time or streaming data systems (e.g., Kafka, Structured Streaming)
Understanding of data observability, lineage, and quality
Prior work in the energy or utility space
Strong grasp of Big Data challenges including cost vs performance tradeoffs


Don’t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women, marginalized genders and people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification. At Uplight we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.
