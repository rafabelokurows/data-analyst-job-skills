Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail

Prior experience at a growth stage internet or software company.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Working remotely at Stripe

A remote location is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.

Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.

Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1.4B+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.

We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.

About The Role

Rippling is building the future of how businesses run — and our Data Cloud team is on a mission to give every customer a full-stack data platform to understand and operate their business, across every function: HR, IT, Finance, and beyond.

We’re looking for a Data Analyst to join our product team — but this isn’t your typical analyst role. You won’t be sitting in a silo writing dashboards for exec reviews. Instead, you’ll be at the center of how we dogfood our own analytics products, solve real reporting needs for our internal teams (starting with HR), and translate those solutions into customer-facing templates, recipes, and product feedback.

If you’re the kind of person who’s happiest when you’re deep in SQL one minute, building dashboards the next, and collaborating with product managers to make tools better the minute after that — this is your role.

What You Will Do


Support internal reporting use cases: Be the go-to person for Rippling’s internal HR reporting needs — helping them define the right metrics, write the SQL, and build clean dashboards using our own reporting tools.
Productize real solutions: Take the reports and dashboards you build for internal teams and turn them into recipes or templates that any Rippling customer can use.
Shape the future of the product: Because you’ll be living in our product every day, you’ll become a key voice for what’s working and what’s not — surfacing gaps, proposing improvements, and even influencing the roadmap.
Be the “power user” of our data stack: Our team builds everything from ingestion to transformation to dashboards. You’ll be working across this full stack, helping make it more usable and scalable through your daily work.
Drive self-serve analytics adoption: Help internal teams (starting with HR) reduce their dependence on ad hoc requests by building the right dashboards and templates to unlock self-serve.


What Success Looks Like


Internal teams can get the reports they need faster — and without asking twice.
Your dashboards become models for how customers solve similar reporting problems.
Your feedback helps us make major product improvements.
We ship better data products because you’ve helped us dogfood our own tools thoroughly and thoughtfully.
You are seen as both a trusted reporting partner and a product-minded analyst who can bridge internal needs and customer-facing solutions.


What You Will Need


3+ years working with data.
Proficiency in SQL and hands-on experience with data exploration and dashboarding tools (Looker, Mode, Tableau, etc.).
A strong sense of product empathy — you don’t just solve the problem, you think about how others could solve it too.
Experience working with People, HR, or GTM teams is a plus.
Comfort navigating ambiguity, unstructured questions, and imperfect data.
Bonus: familiarity with dbt, analytics engineering, or data governance principles.


Why This Role Is Special

This role lives inside the product team, not on a siloed analytics team. That means:


Your work directly informs how we build and improve our data products.
You’re empowered to propose ideas, templates, and workflows based on real usage.
You get to see immediate impact — both internally and externally — from what you build.


This is a great fit for someone who wants to stay hands-on with data, but also get exposure to product development and influence what we ship.

Apply if…


You love using data to unlock clarity for others.
You get excited by operational reporting — not just vanity metrics.
You want to be part of a team building powerful tools and using them every day.
You’re curious, self-directed, and opinionated about what great looks like.

About The Role

We’re seeking a User Operations Data Analyst who will dig deep into user‑support data—surfacing trends, volumes, and friction signals—and turn these findings into actionable insights and always‑on reporting. You’ll design, build, and maintain self‑serve dashboards that keep every stakeholder informed in real time, partnering closely with Data Science and Engineering to ensure clean pipelines, robust models, and scalable tooling. Think proactive friction detection and real‑time service‑health views that help us stay ahead of demand—delivering decision‑grade insights, not just prettier slide decks.

This role is based in San Francisco, California. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In This Role, You Will


Explore large support and product datasets to uncover trends, volume drivers, and user‑experience pain points, distilling findings into clear, actionable narratives.
Build, enhance, and maintain self‑serve dashboards and reporting tools, enabling non‑technical teams to answer their own data questions.
Establish a unified metrics taxonomy for service‑health and performance—and build automated data‑sharing pipelines and scorecards with our BPO partners to ensure everyone operates from the same real‑time view of success
Leverage LLMs to build bespoke classifiers that automatically label and segment inbound volumes—powering smarter routing, richer self‑serve insights, and swifter root‑cause analysis.
Partner with Data Engineering to ensure reliable pipelines, implement data‑quality checks, and document sources of truth.
Jump into high‑priority special projects to conduct bespoke deep‑dive analyses and deliver clear, strategic recommendations to leadership.
Prototype quickly—leveraging ChatGPT, Jupyter notebooks, Retool, and other tools—to prove value before hardening with Engineering.
Collaborate with Data Science on predictive models and experimentation, translating results into operational recommendations.


You Might Thrive In This Role If You


8 + years in analytics, business intelligence, or data science, ideally supporting customer support or operations teams.
Expert‑level SQL skills and proficiency in Python or R for advanced analysis and automation
Hands‑on experience designing and maintaining BI dashboards (e.g. Looker, Mode, Tableau, Sundial) with a focus on clarity and self‑serve usability.
Hands‑on experience fine‑tuning or prompt‑engineering LLMs to build text classifiers, sentiment analysis, or tagging systems.
Demonstrated ability to translate complex datasets into clear business stories and recommendations for both technical and non‑technical audiences.
Familiarity with support metrics (SLAs, FCR, deflection) and ability to define service health KPIs.
Strong cross‑functional communication skills—comfortable collaborating daily with engineers, data scientists, and operations leaders.
An eye for detail, a zero‑defect mindset, and a bias toward action over theoretical perfection
Possess a strong bias for automation and can defend governance decisions that keep data and processes healthy as they grow.
Thrive in a fast‑moving, ambiguous environment where priorities can shift quickly.

Collaborate deeply: Work closely with cross-functional teams to integrate analytics into product roadmaps, operational processes, and strategic initiatives.

Mentor and elevate: Help junior analysts grow their skills in analysis, communication, and technical execution.

Safeguard data integrity: Ensure analytics work meets rigorous compliance, governance, and privacy standards—especially in a regulated healthcare environment.

Proficiency in building and validating statistical / machine learning models
Expertise in optimization algorithms, seasonal models, and portfolio analysis


Strategic skills: Able to translate ambiguous business problems into clear, data-driven solutions.

Collaboration: Comfortable working with multiple commercial partners on data sourcing, integration, and model building.

Communication: Strong ability to translate complex findings into clear, compelling narratives for technical and non-technical audiences.

Mindset: Startup-tested, adaptable to shifting priorities, energized by complex problems.

Education: Master’s degree in Mathematics, Engineering, or Data Science; Bachelor’s in a related field such as Statistics, Computer Science, Economics, or Physics.

EVERY™ is a leading VC-backed food tech ingredient company and market leader using precision fermentation to create animal proteins without the animal for the global food and beverage industry. EVERY™ is a team of passionate change-makers who are reimagining the factory farm model with a kinder, more sustainable alternative. Leveraging precision fermentation to produce hyper-functional and one-to-one replacement proteins from microorganisms, EVERY™ is on a mission to decouple the world’s proteins from the animals that make them. We are a passionate, determined (and fun!) team with a vital objective, and we're on the lookout for like-minded people to join our mission. For more information, visit www.every.com 

The Role: 

We’re looking for a Data Analytics Engineer who can bridge the gap between data analysis and software engineering. This is a hybrid role for someone who’s excited to work across systems, dig into messy data, and build tools and pipelines that help teams make better decisions, faster.

You are a technical expert that will partner closely with stakeholders across science, product, and operations, helping us translate questions into clean, usable data and insights. This role is part of our long-term data strategy and will own key parts of our analytics reporting services supporting the organization’s data infrastructure.

What you'll accomplish

Bring dashboards to life for teams across R&D, manufacturing, supply chain, and business operations making it easier for them to access the data they need without manual work or spreadsheet juggling.
Cut down reporting delays by connecting backend systems (like BigQuery and Cloud SQL) to intuitive dashboards and tools that surface real-time insights.
Take ownership of internal data tools, helping keep it running smoothly while making quick improvements when bugs or user requests come up.
Scale our data systems and company tools as business needs expand to require additional software.
Partner with stakeholders to understand what really matters, then turn those needs into usable, self-serve tools and dashboards that make decisions faster and more accurate.
Write clean, maintainable SQL and Python that powers everything from dashboards to lightweight backend fixes—removing blockers and improving the flow of information across the org.
Jump in where needed on smaller data and analytics projects whether that’s building a quick connector, cleaning up an API, or filling a gap in reporting.

What you bring (required)

3–5+ years of experience in data analytics, analytics engineering, or full-stack data roles
Strong SQL skills, with experience modeling data for reporting and decision-making (e.g., via dbt, Looker, or custom dashboards)
Python experience for scripting, automation, and backend data support
Building data visualization and dashboards (Looker, Tableau, Qlikview etc.)
Experience working with data warehouses & API integration  (GCP, AWS, BigQuery preferred) and connecting them to downstream tools
Familiarity with building or supporting internal tools and applications  (Netsuite, LIMS, or similar lightweight frameworks)
Comfortable working directly with business users to translate messy needs into clean, usable dashboards and reports
Strong problem-solving skills and ability to move quickly in ambiguous or fast-changing environments
Bonus: Familiarity with working in biotech/manufacturing settings and data architecture.

Pay Range: $130,000 - $170,000 + Stock Options

At EVERY™, pay ranges are subject to change and assigned to a job based on the location-specific market median of similar jobs according to 3rd-party salary benchmark surveys. Individual pay within that range can vary for several reasons including skills/capabilities, experience, and available budget.

EVERY’s Dedication to Fairness

EVERY is dedicated to building a just environment based on merit and kindess. EVERY’s goal is to have a workplace that enables productivity and meaningful work for individuals from all backgrounds, experiences, and lifestyles, allowing all employees to feel comfortable being their true, authentic selves at work.

Legal authorization to work in the U.S. is required.  We are not able to sponsor individuals for employment visas for this job.

DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

Hightouch's mission is to empower everyone to take action on their data. Hundreds of companies, including Autotrader, Calendly, Cars.com, Monday.com, and PetSmart, trust Hightouch to power their growth.

Traditionally, only technical teams had the skills to access and use customer data. With Hightouch, every business user can deliver personalized customer experiences, optimize performance marketing, and move faster by leveraging data and AI across their organization.

Our team focuses on making a meaningful impact for our customers. We approach challenges with a first-principles mindset, move quickly and efficiently, and treat each other with compassion and kindness. We look for team members who are strong communicators, have a growth mindset, and are motivated and persistent in achieving our goals.

What else? We're based in San Francisco but have team members all over the world. Our Series C put us at a $1.2B valuation, and we are backed by leading investors such as Sapphire Ventures, Amplify Partners, ICONIQ Growth, Bain Capital Ventures, Y-Combinator, and Afore Capital.

Adapt on the fly-thrive in ambiguity, pivot quickly as priorities shift, and take ownership beyond your job description to get things done.
Be a culture carrier-support company-wide programs, events, and initiatives that keep our team connected and motivated.


What We're Looking For


Experience supporting C-level or senior executives in a high-growth, fast-paced environment.

Formation Bio is a tech and AI driven pharma company differentiated by radically more efficient drug development.

Advancements in AI and drug discovery are creating more candidate drugs than the industry can progress because of the high cost and time of clinical trials. Recognizing that this development bottleneck may ultimately limit the number of new medicines that can reach patients, Formation Bio, founded in 2016 as TrialSpark Inc., has built technology platforms, processes, and capabilities to accelerate all aspects of drug development and clinical trials. Formation Bio partners, acquires, or in-licenses drugs from pharma companies, research organizations, and biotechs to develop programs past clinical proof of concept and beyond, ultimately helping to bring new medicines to patients. The company is backed by investors across pharma and tech, including a16z, Sequoia, Sanofi, Thrive Capital, Sam Altman, John Doerr, Spark Capital, SV Angel Growth, and others.

As the role is our entry level, this is a great entry point for a career path at Lokad, either as a future technical expert or as manager.




We help companies in different verticals (aerospace, automotive, ecommerce…) to forecast and make decisions about their inventory. The vast majority of our clients are based outside of France, mainly in North America and Europe.




As a Business Data Analyst (or Supply Chain Scientist in Lokad's terminology), your role is to make sure our clients get the most from Lokad's technology. The role is a mix between technology, data crunching and supply chain expertise. You will address complex supply chain issues and craft quantitative strategies. Your goal is not only to advise your clients on strategies to adopt, but to craft and execute these strategies on a daily basis while leveraging the data available as much as possible. Your goal is also to keep refining these strategies over time to keep them aligned with the needs of our clients.




At Lokad, you will benefit from the extensive training and coaching of our expert team. You will gain skills in supply chain, predictive analysis and overall quantitative optimization for business. You will learn how to achieve measurable business results grounded on scientific analysis of data.




About one quarter of your time is spent interacting with clients in order to better understand their business (mainly over the phone or by mail, with occasional travels). Note that, in order to benefit from your colleagues expertise, you won't be required to work on the customers' premises.




The rest of your time is spent on data analysis, including manipulating and cleaning data, setting up forecasts, economic optimization, reporting and data vizualisation. In order to do this, you'll learn to use our Differentiable Programming tools and a DSL (Envision) developped by Lokad.




We are looking for candidates with the following skills and qualities:




A strong engineering background.
A keen interest in data and quantitative analysis in general.
Good Excel skills or programming skills (e.g. Python, VBA, SQL, etc.).
Impeccable command of English ( French is optional).
Excellent communication skills and telephone manners.
A well-made head, rather than a well-filled head. We are not looking for someone who is already an expert in supply chain or programming. We’re looking for a fast learner, with an ability to quickly grasp technology and concepts, since our technology is by no means a simple and plug-and-play product. Knowledge or understanding of supply chain would be a bonus, but the ability to quickly assess and grasp a new situation or get a clear picture of how an organization works and what are the pain points is what we are really after.
Candidates must be self-motivated, confident and highly driven to achieve results with a “hands on” attitude.




The role is predominantly office based, although some travel will be occasionally required to customers, partners or events. We are located in the very center of Paris, France (station Chevaleret).

Wij zijn op zoek naar een financieel data analist. En niet zomaar eentje. We zoeken geen rekenmeester die blijft hangen in Excel-tabellen. We zoeken een financieel data analist die cijfers tot leven brengt met Power BI en complexe vraagstukken vertaalt naar inzichten waar klanten écht wat mee kunnen. Jij zoekt een plek waar je jouw kennis kunt verdiepen, data écht kunt inzetten én direct waarde toevoegt voor klanten.




Bij Thésor werk je samen met een hecht team. Gezamenlijk zetten wij ons in voor maatschappelijke organisaties zoals woningcorporaties, zorginstellingen en onderwijsinstellingen.

Wat ga je doen?

Als Financieel Data Analist ben je het aanspreekpunt voor je eigen klanten en hun financiële vraagstukken. Je bezoekt samen met een treasury adviseur de klanten, doorgrondt hun situatie en geef je passend advies. Je combineert je financiële kennis met data-analyse en visualisaties en vertaalt complexe informatie naar heldere adviezen.

Je maakt financiële analyses, rapportages en dashboards in Power BI en bespreekt deze met klanten.
Je bezoekt klanten regelmatig en draagt verantwoordelijkheid voor de relatie en de kwaliteit van onze dienstverlening.
Je verdiept je in rente(curves), waarderings- en financieringsvraagstukken, of ontwikkelt je daar stapsgewijs in.
Je helpt processen slimmer en efficiënter te maken door data en tools optimaal te benutten en te ontwikkelen.
Je werkt nauw samen met collega’s en klanten en draagt bij aan verbeteringen in zowel onze interne processen als onze dienstverlening.
Je bent de spil tussen ons IT team en de gebruikers: je digitaliseert, verbetert en ondersteunt gebruikers waar nodig.
Je krijgt de ruimte om je te ontwikkelen richting treasury-expert en specialistische onderwerpen.
Je onderzoekt innovaties en ontwikkelingen in de markt en implementeert relevante verbeteringen voor onze klanten en organisatie.




Waarom kiezen voor Thésor?

Bij ons draait alles om kwaliteit, inhoud en maatschappelijke impact. Wij geloven dat jij het verschil kunt maken voor publieke en semipublieke organisaties.

Een hecht team – samenwerken, leren en elkaar uitdagen in een collegiale sfeer.

Minimaal 3 jaar relevante ervaring in een financiële of analytische rol.
Sterke analytische vaardigheden en de capaciteit om complexe materie om te zetten in duidelijke adviezen.

Affiniteit met data-analyse, dashboards en procesverbetering.
Leergierig en nieuwsgierig naar innovaties en nieuwe vaardigheden.
Sterke communicatieve vaardigheden en het vermogen om vertrouwen op te bouwen bij klanten, waarbij je fungeert als hun vaste aanspreekpunt.
Nauwkeurigheid en de drive om kwalitatief hoogwaardig werk te leveren.
Uitstekende beheersing van de Nederlandse taal, in woord en geschrift.




Wat krijg je?

€2.800 - €5.800 bruto p/m op fulltime basis (afhankelijk van kennis en ervaring)
13e maand en 8,7% vakantiegeld
32 tot 40-urige werkweek (flexibel in te delen)
30 vakantiedagen bij een fulltime dienstverband

Onze partner gelooft dat de kracht van data pas echt tot zijn recht komt als mens, proces en technologie perfect samenkomen. Daarom creëren ze een verbonden data-ecosysteem waarmee organisaties eindelijk de waarde van hun data volledig kunnen benutten.




De Rol

Als Data Engineer ontwerp, ontwikkel en optimaliseer je schaalbare datastructuren voor onze klanten. Je bouwt robuuste datapijplijnen, data-architecturen en cloudoplossingen die geavanceerde analyses en AI-toepassingen mogelijk maken. Samen met data scientists, analisten en software engineers zorg je voor betrouwbare en toekomstbestendige oplossingen die organisaties helpen écht datagedreven te werken.

Dit is de ideale rol voor een data engineer die energie krijgt van Microsoft-technologie en graag wil groeien binnen een dynamische consultancy waar strategie, data en technologie samenkomen.




Wat je gaat doen

Ontwerpen, ontwikkelen en onderhouden van schaalbare datapijplijnen en ETL/ELT-processen met Azure Data Factory en Azure Synapse Analytics.
Bouwen en optimaliseren van datamodellen voor Power BI en andere BI-tools.
Ontwikkelen van dataplatforms met Azure Databricks, Azure SQL en Microsoft Fabric.
Zorgen voor datakwaliteit, consistentie en betrouwbaarheid met duidelijke governance.
Intensief samenwerken met analisten, data scientists en business stakeholders.
Optimaliseren van opslag, verwerking en performance in cloudomgevingen.
Bijdragen aan de ontwikkeling van onze data engineering-aanpak en Microsoft-expertise.




Jij hebt:

3 jaar ervaring als Data Engineer met focus op Microsoft Azure. (iets minder mag ook ;) )
Goede kennis van Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse, Azure SQL en Microsoft Fabric.
Ervaring met Power BI, inclusief DAX en best practices voor datavisualisatie.
Kennis van data governance, security en compliance in cloudomgevingen.
Proactief, gestructureerd en in staat technische initiatieven te leiden.
Analytisch sterk en een echte doener.
Uitstekende communicatieve vaardigheden in Nederlands én Engels.




Hoe je week eruit ziet!

We vinden balans en samenwerking belangrijk. Daarom ziet een gemiddelde werkweek er zo uit:

2 dagen op locatie bij klanten, onder begeleiding van een ervaren collega.
2 dagen op ons kantoor in Arnhem, om samen te werken en te sparren.
1 dag werk je vanuit huis, met de flexibiliteit die daarbij hoort.
Je hebt de ruimte voor studie, training of certificering – zodat je altijd blijft groeien.
En dat doe je niet alleen: je hebt gedreven collega’s om je heen die altijd klaarstaan om te helpen, en je werkt aan uitdagende projecten voor internationale klanten.




Wij bieden je het volgende:

Werken aan impactvolle projecten voor grote ondernemingen en bekende merken.
Onderdeel worden van een multidisciplinair team waar strategie, data en technologie samenkomen.
Een cultuur van eigenaarschap, initiatief en continu leren.
Kansen om door te groeien, met veel aandacht voor leiderschapsontwikkeling.
Een hybride werkomgeving met flexibiliteit.
Een marktconform salaris en aantrekkelijk arbeidsvoorwaardenpakket.
