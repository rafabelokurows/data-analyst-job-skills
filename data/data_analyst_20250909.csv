However, steep entry barriers, including high minimum investments (~€10m), hefty paperwork and the challenge of selecting the right fund have traditionally kept individual investors at bay, with access largely limited to big institutions or a select few.

Enter Moonfare.




We've made investing in private equity more accessible and straightforward with our fully digital investment platform. Now, qualified investors can access some of the most sought-after private market funds at lower minimum investment amounts*.




The diverse Moonfare team – which includes alumni from top private banks, groundbreaking startups and beyond – is united in pushing boundaries and redefining the private equity landscape.




Join us!

At Moonfare, we are on a mission to democratise access to top-tier private market investments.

You’ll be part of a small, high impact team that sits at the intersection of data engineering, product, marketing, and commercial, enabling the business through actionable insights, scalable reporting, and high quality data models.




You will shape how we understand performance, measure success, and identify new opportunities across the company. Your work will help ensure that decisions at Moonfare are always backed by clear, well structured, and meaningful data.




You will:

Develop and maintain advanced SQL-based data models to power business reporting and analysis
Build scalable dashboards and self service tools using Tableau, enabling teams across Moonfare to access key metrics and insights
Perform exploratory and strategic analysis to support product launches, marketing campaigns, and commercial initiatives
Partner closely with product managers, marketing, and business stakeholders to understand goals and define relevant KPIs
Lead experimentation efforts including A/B test design, implementation, and interpretation
Advocate for data quality and consistency, ensuring models and reporting are accurate, well documented, and easily understood
Collaborate with the wider data and analytics team to improve data infrastructure and analytics tooling
Drive initiatives that increase data literacy and empower teams to use data more effectively




The next Moonfarian:

Has 5–7 years of experience as a Data, Product, or Marketing Analyst
Has a proven track record of transforming data infrastructure and metrics to support business growth
Possesses advanced SQL skills (BigQuery, PostgreSQL), along with strong Spreadsheet and Tableau proficiency; experience with dbt and Snowflake is a plus
Has hands-on experience working with commercial, product, or marketing datasets
Is comfortable designing and interpreting A/B tests and leading experimentation efforts
Collaborates effectively across both technical and non-technical teams
Communicates clearly, takes ownership, and is passionate about driving business impact through data




If you feel you do not meet all of the requirements, we still encourage you to apply!




Our Values:

Our clients come first, Moonfare comes second, and we prioritise ourselves third - Client-Centric Focus. Putting clients first means creating value for them is essential. Placing Moonfare second signifies that our individual professional future at Moonfare depends on the company's commercial success. Prioritising ourselves third reflects our humility in putting clients and Moonfare before personal interests.
We pursue excellence and honor our promises - Commitment to Excellence. We hold ourselves to the highest standards, taking responsibility for our failures, and celebrating our successes. We commit to deadlines and stick to them and we learn from our mistakes.
We are here to win and to celebrate our collective achievements - Win together. We are mission-focused and think and act like owners. We exemplify the attitude we expect and each of us commits to do what it takes to succeed.
We foster personal growth but each of us earns our place as a Moonfarian through merit - Growth and Merit. We hire, retain, and develop exceptional people and invest in empowering them to excel. We must all earn our place at the table every day.




We understand the important role that diversity plays in our success. Different backgrounds, experiences and ideas push us further and raise the bar. We’re committed to developing an inclusive and safe culture where everyone — regardless of colour, race, religion, sex, origin, sexuality, disability, marital status, citizenship or gender identity — knows that they are an integral part of the team and can bring their full potential to their work.

We partner with studios and internally develop games, having launched over 80 titles, reached over 2 billion downloads, and seen our game All in Hole break into the global top-50 grossing charts.

What powers the loop is talent density. 220+ people from 30+ nationalities, bringing expertise from the world's best studios and companies. We uphold ambition, curiosity, humility, and focus, and deliver with speed, excellence, and candor.

Since the start, we've raised $165M from Headline, Northzone, Eurazeo, Bpifrance, and the founders of King, Sorare, and Spotify, people who've built and backed the games and platforms we admire, now supporting our drive to create the next ones.

Our vision is to reimagine payments from the ground up. We are building a deeply integrated meta layer that spans the entire payment lifecycle with a modular architecture.

About Us

LYNX helps you invest in yourself""

""Working at LYNX means joining the LYNX family""

""The development opportunities make LYNX the best place to work""

This is what the employees say about LYNX and it is exactly what we want to offer: a work environment where you can get the best out of yourself. At our office in the heart of Amsterdam, Ghent, Berlin and Prague, we work every day to offer both private and professional clients the best trading opportunities, with a fast, user-friendly and reliable trading platform.

The Best Choice For Anyone Who Takes Investing Seriously

LYNX is an international FinTech that offers you a relaxed and informal work environment, where you can get the best out of yourself and where 300 people contribute together to the success of our customers since 2006.

In 2006 LYNX entered the investor market with two spearheads: very low rates and an extensive product range. This makes the online broker not only successful in the Netherlands, but also abroad. After opening offices in Belgium, Germany and the Czech Republic, LYNX now offers its services in ten different countries, making it a European broker of size.

In 2019 the product of LYNX, and therefore the offer for investors, has been greatly improved. For example, a highly advanced mobile and tablet app is available, the LYNX Masterclass webinars can be watched weekly via the Knowledge Portal, and thanks to the Morning Call, investors are quickly daily informed about the latest news on the financial markets.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified and eligible candidates without attention to gender identity/expression, age, racial, ethnic and cultural background, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation/identity, disability or neurodiversity.

Deep Dive & Exploratory Analysis: Conduct complex, end-to-end exploratory analyses on large-scale user behavior data (transactional, clickstream, etc.) to uncover non-obvious insights, identify root causes of trends, and directly inform product strategy and roadmap development.
Technical & Mentorship Leadership: Contribute significantly to the growth and development of fellow product analysts through knowledge sharing sessions, best practice dissemination, workflow optimizations, and active participation in hiring and onboarding processes. Champion and drive analytical excellence within the team and broader organization.

Expertise in statistical methods applied to experimental design (A/B testing, multivariate tests, etc.), causal inference, and robust hypothesis validation. You should be able to navigate complex statistical challenges and explain methodologies clearly.

Proficiency with at least one data visualization tool such as Looker Studio (Data Studio), Tableau, QlikView, or Power BI, with a proven ability to create compelling and insightful dashboards.
Demonstrated ability to influence and collaborate with multiple stakeholders, including senior product managers, engineers, and business leaders.

In dieser Rolle gestaltest Du aktiv mit, wie wir Daten sinnvoll strukturieren, verständlich visualisieren und strategisch einsetzen.

Deine Aufgaben Im Detail


Du entwickelst, gestaltest und pflegst interaktive Dashboards und Reports mit Microsoft Power BI sowie weiteren BI-Tools.
Du analysierst komplexe Datensätze, erkennst Muster, Trends und leitest daraus konkrete Handlungsempfehlungen für das Business ab.
Du arbeitest eng mit verschiedenen Stakeholdern zusammen und übersetzt Business-Anforderungen in smarte Datenlösungen.
Du stellst sicher, dass Datenqualität, -integrität und -konsistenz (Data Governance) über alle Quellen hinweg gewährleistet sind.
Du optimierst Datenmodelle, Abfragen und Visualisierungen, sodass Insights schnell und verständlich verfügbar sind.
Du bringst Dich aktiv bei der Weiterentwicklung unserer Datenstrategie, Data Governance und BI-Best Practices ein.


Deine Tätigkeit kannst Du entweder in unserem Berliner Office oder ganz bequem von zu Hause aus (mobiles Arbeiten bzw. Homeoffice) ausführen.


Du hast einen Studienabschluss in einem relevanten Bereich, z. B. Mathematik, Statistik, (Wirtschafts-)Informatik oder einem verwandten Fachgebiet.
Du bringst bereits fundierte Erfahrung als Data Analyst oder im BI-Umfeld mit und kannst komplexe Daten klar strukturieren und interpretieren.
Du bist fit in Microsoft Power BI (DAX, Power Query, Datenmodellierung) und kennst Dich idealerweise auch mit weiteren BI-/Visualisierungstools (z. B. Tableau) sowie Python aus.
Du verfügst über solides SQL-Wissen und hast Erfahrung im Umgang mit Data Warehouses.
Du verstehst Datenarchitekturen, ETL-Prozesse und die Prinzipien von Data Governance.
Du kommunizierst klar und überzeugend - sowohl auf Deutsch als auch auf Englisch - und kannst Insights verständlich auf den Punkt bringen.
Du bist detailorientiert, proaktiv und behältst auch in einem dynamischen Umfeld mehrere Themen im Blick.
In der interdisziplinären Zusammenarbeit zeigst Du Teamgeist, Offenheit und die Fähigkeit, gemeinsam tragfähige Lösungen zu entwickeln.


Wir sind uns bewusst, dass kaum ein Profil alle Anforderungen vollständig abdecken kann. Wenn Du bereit bist, Dich fachlich weiterzuentwickeln und bereits erste einschlägige Erfahrungen mitbringst, bist Du bei uns ebenso richtig!


Unsere Flexibilität bei Arbeitszeit und Arbeitsort gibt Dir den Freiraum, Deine beruflichen Ziele zu erreichen, ohne auf persönliche Zeit verzichten zu müssen.

You have experience in designing, building, and managing complex data models and handling large unstructured and semi-structured data



Experience is great, but what we really look for is drive, intelligence, and integrity. So even if you don’t tick every box, please consider applying if you feel you’re the kind of person described above!

About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: that’s why the majority of our product range is vegan. We also take an innovative approach to packaging: most of our products are packaged in glass, making them almost entirely recyclable.

Our diverse team in Berlin consists of over 290 employees from more than 40 nationalities and continues to grow – but at a sustainable pace. Our goal is to foster a collaborative, supportive, and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary team members.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

We’re a fast-growing PropTech startup on a mission to completely transform the commercial property industry. Backed by top-tier VCs, industry experts, and a leadership team with deep real estate and technology expertise, our all-in-one platform and rich industry data are already trusted by 80% of the UK commercial real estate market.




We’re building new product lines, unlocking untapped market segments, and scaling internationally and we’re doing it with a small, focused team that moves fast, thinks big, and communicates openly.




We need a Data Analyst who thrives in high-growth, high-energy environments. Someone who can work end-to-end from scoping questions with stakeholders, to digging into complex datasets, to delivering insights that directly influence decisions across the company.

At Kato, data isn’t just a byproduct of what we do - it drives every decision we make.




Whether it’s helping sales prioritise the hottest leads, guiding product to build features our customers will love, or giving leadership the visibility they need to set strategy - data is at the heart of it! This is not a “sit in the corner and build reports” role. You’ll be:




Embedded in conversations with decision-makers.
Helping shape the company’s direction at a strategic level.
Ensuring data is clean, reliable, and accessible so that every team can move faster.

Deliver clear, actionable insights to support fast, informed decisions.
Maintain and improve reports and dashboards to track company-wide KPIs.

Work closely with analytics and data engineers to improve accessibility and quality.
Maintain curated datasets for recurring reports and business-critical analyses.




Data Quality & Governance




Validate and QA data to ensure 100% trust in the numbers.
Document analytical processes, data definitions, and calculation logic.
Support initiatives that improve metric consistency and governance across teams.




Stakeholder Collaboration




Partner with every function such as Product, Marketing, Ops, Finance, to gather requirements and deliver data-driven insights.
Translate business needs into analytical approaches and clear, confident recommendations.Manage projects end-to-end, from scoping through to delivering outputs that land with impact.




What We’re Looking For:




Must-Haves:




Strong proficiency in SQL for querying and transforming data, plus advanced Excel skills.
Hands-on experience with BI/visualisation tools (Quicksight, Tableau, Power BI, Looker).
Comfort working with large, complex datasets from multiple sources.
Strong analytical skills, a problem-solving mindset, and a laser focus on detail.
Ability to communicate complex data stories to diverse audiences - from engineers to execs.
Experience collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver measurable business impact.




Nice-to-Haves:




Python or R for deeper analysis.
Familiarity with dbt and modern data warehouses (Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks).
Experience in statistical analysis, experimentation, or A/B testing.
Exposure to data governance best practices and documentation.




What Success Looks Like:




Teams across Kato are making faster, better decisions thanks to your insights.
Dashboards and reports are trusted, up-to-date, and directly support business goals.

Offer - If we’re aligned, we won’t hang around - we’ll get you an offer fast!




Why Join us at Kato?




Impact from day one - your work will be live and influencing decisions within days, not months.
Small, high-calibre team - work alongside talented people who care deeply about the mission.
Direct access to leadership - you’ll be in the room for important conversations, not on the sidelines.
Growth opportunities - as we scale, you’ll have the chance to take on more responsibility and shape your role.

‍

We’re making good health last a lifetime

‍

More than 1 billion people globally live with obesity, a significant leading indicator of many preventable chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.

‍

Eucalyptus is the company behind Juniper, one of the world’s largest weight management programs combining GLP-1 medication with a tailored nutrition and exercise programme, supported by our multidisciplinary care team of prescribers, health coaches, dietitians, nurses and pharmacists.

‍

Our published clinical research demonstrates that our combined approach to weight management and lifestyle change increases the likelihood of our patients losing significant weight during their treatment with Juniper by four times.

‍

Since launching, we’ve grown fast to support millions of patients. In the last 12 months:


We have grown the size of our patient base in Germany by 6x, in this year alone, and expect to grow another 2x by end-of-year.
Globally, we grew revenue by >120% YoY, while reducing cash burned by 90% YoY, with over $100M USD raised from global investors such as BOND, NewView, Blackbird and Airtree - early backers of companies like Canva, Stripe, Uber and Airbnb.



‍

What’s next?

‍

In 2025, we are charting the path to support hundreds of thousands of patients while launching into new conditions, demographics, and geographies as we move towards our vision of creating a preventive healthcare ecosystem.

‍

We’re building the world’s largest international digital healthcare company. This will be highly challenging, very rewarding and the adventure of a lifetime, working with the best operators you will ever encounter.

‍

If that gets you excited, let’s talk!

‍

About The Role (What You’ll Be Doing)

‍


Drive strategic insights – Take ownership of key analytical projects, translating complex data into actionable insights that directly inform business-critical decisions across multiple teams and functions.
Optimise data architecture – Enhance our data model for Germany, and Eucalyptus globally, collaborating with our analytics team in Australia to ensure scalability and consistency that drives decision-making at both local and global levels.
Empower data-driven decisions – Elevate our reporting and dashboard capabilities, establishing a single source of truth for critical metrics and enabling teams with self-service tools to independently access and apply data.
Monitor performance & influence growth – Track and analyse key initiatives, identify trends, and uncover growth opportunities that drive business-wide impact, from acquisition to retention and beyond.



‍

About You (Who You Are)

‍


5+ years of data analyst experience – You’ve created and owned end-to-end data products in consumer organisations.
Advanced analytical thinking & tool proficiency – Expert in SQL, Python, and Sheets, with a focus on uncovering drivers of business performance and shaping data-informed strategy.
Applied data science for commercial outcomes – Skilled in using statistical techniques, experimentation, and behavioural data to answer complex business questions and guide commercial decision-making.
Marketing analytics & martech experience – You’ve worked with CRM, campaign, and attribution data across tools like Segment and Customer.io (or similar). You’ve built models or reporting that help marketing teams understand performance, optimise spend, and improve lifecycle outcomes.
Ambiguity & a fast-paced environment excites you – Your curiosity drives you to ask ‘why?’ to get to the next level of understanding; and you can work at speed.
You see more than the data – You have strong business and commercial acumen, and get to the ‘so what’ based on the analysis you do. You help shape the right analysis for the decision at hand.
Attention to detail – You have a high bar for ‘correct’, and work through nuances in the data to surface when an insight can be relied on and when it can’t.
Exceptional communicator – You distil complex analyses into clear, actionable insights that cut through the noise, enabling teams to quickly understand the ‘so what’ and take decisive action.



‍

So, why join Eucalyptus?

‍


Make real impact, fast – We build in the open together, which helps us learn and iterate more quickly to deliver high-quality outcomes faster than anyone else. You’ll help improve patients’ lives from the moment you join Euc.
You’ll be supported to accelerate your career – Regular feedback, bi-annual performance reviews, a professional development budget, and dedicated leave help ensure you have what you need to level up. We’re committed to helping every Eucalypt reach their full potential.
You’ll work with others who are incredibly passionate about what they do – Our talent bar is high, and our work ethic is strong. You’ll stretch yourself daily, tackle meaningful problems with autonomy, and work alongside people who care deeply about our patients.
We also offer a range of benefits, including:
Your own stake in the business with our employee options program
Newly opened HQ in vibrant Old Street, designed for focus and collaboration
A flexible hybrid setup: 3 days a week in our Old Street office
A monthly wellness allowance, for you to spend on whatever wellness means to you
A yearly personal development budget and 3 extra days of leave to continuously up-skill yourself
25 days holiday + bank holidays with an enhanced parental leave policy
A fun office with regular socials including after-school sport, clubs, cycle kick-offs, and seasonal parties. We had our winter social in Paris last year! 🇫🇷
Your own MacBook and more!

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Sound like something you’d like to be a part of? We’d love to hear from you!

Avant Arte is a curated marketplace that makes discovering and collecting art radically more accessible for a new generation. Our team of passionate experts collaborate with leading contemporary artists from across the globe to create bespoke limited-edition artworks to browse and collect. We began as a cult blog of contemporary artists and since 2015 we've grown our community to over 3.3 million strong across more than 100 countries. We're proud to collaborate with leading contemporary artists to create limited edition works - from sculpture editions and works on paper to NFTs and hand-finished silkscreen prints.




OUR CULTURE

We’re a small team with really big ambitions, both for what we want to achieve and also the environment we’re building. We want to create a company that remains thoughtful as we scale and tries to be genuinely progressive in how we operate. We want people to really own what they do and be given the autonomy and freedom to make mistakes, learn, and create something meaningful.

We all work incredibly hard because we really care about what Avant Arte is here to do – we’re looking for exceptional people who are proactive, hungry to learn, and want to put their pride in our collective achievements.




We know that creating an inclusive environment that promotes and values diversity is critical if we want to build something with impact and meaning. We believe that having diversity in age, background, gender identity, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, ethnicity, and perspective will make us an infinitely better company. We were shortlisted for Women in Tech’s Best Employer - Small Company and Best Benefits, and Otta’s top 100 startups to work at. 




WHAT WE NEED

We’re looking for a full-stack data analyst. We really do encourage everyone to proactively step outside of their job description if they see something that could be improved but the core of your role will involve:




Data infrastructure - (provide overall activity e.g. artist research and outline details below subheading) 

Own and maintain data models in dbt, upholding high standards for clarity, performance, and documentation
Write clear, efficient SQL (and occasionally Python) for both ad hoc analyses and scheduled reporting




Business reporting

Partner with teams across the business to define, implement and maintain business reporting frameworks
Work closely with different functional partners to level up our teams’ access to data and enhance our self-serve data infrastructure




Insights and analyses

Conduct deep-dive analyses to answer key business questions and surface new opportunities
Share insights through crisp, accessible storytelling, tailoring outputs as appropriate for both technical and non-technical audiences




Data strategy 

Contribute to the development and maintenance of Avant Arte’s long-term data strategy
Work closely with different stakeholders to build and manage a pipeline of impactful data initiatives




The main skills we’re looking for are:

Proficient in SQL and experienced using dbt for analytics engineering
Comfortable with dashboarding tools—Metabase preferred, but Looker or Tableau is great too
Strong grasp of how to define, measure, and track meaningful metrics
Curious, self-directed, and passionate about telling clear, compelling stories with data




We think you’ll probably have:

 2–4 years of experience in a data, analytics, or similar role
Familiarity with e-commerce, digital content, or the creative industries is a plus
A love of art and culture isn’t required—but definitely encouraged

 

Don’t meet every single requirement? Avant Arte is dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic team so we encourage you to apply anyway. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.




BENEFITS INCLUDE:

Generous equity allowance
Private Healthcare (UK)
Enhanced pension contributions and parental leave policies 
25 days of holiday plus four extra company wide days
L&D budget of €1000 per year per employee
Regular company socials
Art loan scheme for employees

Curious & proactive – Always seeking better ways and fresh insights.

Adaptable & independent – Comfortable in a fast-moving environment.
Collaborative – A team player who works well across functions.
Analytically strong – Skilled in SQL and data analysis.
Passionate about learning – F&B knowledge or experience helps, but enthusiasm for data matters most.

Managing the entire research process, from drafting surveys, designing sampling strategies, managing data collection, and processing results.
Producing analysis and translating it into clear and actionable reports and presentations for an exciting range of clients. 
Learning and applying the fundamentals of data analysis, including regression, segmentation, principal component analysis and more. 
Combining quantitative and qualitative data to produce authoritative advice to clients across the public, private and not-for-profit sectors on strategy and campaigning.

You will play a pivotal part in ensuring that all data and management information processes are delivered accurately and efficiently, adhering to both internal procedures and regulatory requirements.

What You'll Do

As a Data and MI Analyst, you will be responsible for ensuring the smooth operation of all data-related activities within the Client Lifecycle Management function. Your day-to-day tasks will involve handling complex datasets, performing reconciliations for both internal use and regulatory compliance, as well as documenting essential procedures. You will be expected to communicate effectively with colleagues across departments when investigating data discrepancies or resolving queries. Your ability to manage your workload independently while remaining an active contributor to team projects will be crucial for success. By providing accurate management information in a timely manner, you will directly support decision-making processes throughout the organisation. The role also offers opportunities to participate in ad hoc projects that further develop your analytical skills while fostering a culture of collaboration.


Maintain and report on all data and management information across multiple platforms, ensuring timely uploads and oversight of internal reporting repositories.
Manipulate, clean, and structure large datasets to ensure accuracy and consistency for both internal stakeholders and regulatory bodies.
Conduct ad hoc investigations into data issues, communicating findings clearly to resolve queries efficiently.
Perform daily, weekly, and monthly reconciliations as well as prepare reports required for internal governance and external compliance.
Document and update procedures related to data management and management information processes to ensure best practices are followed at all times.
Demonstrate ownership of assigned deliverables by producing outputs that are both timely and accurate, reflecting a high standard of responsibility.
Monitor shared mailboxes diligently, responding to queries with professionalism and clarity.
Assist colleagues within the team on various projects as needed, sharing knowledge to enhance overall team performance.
Support the wider Data and Management Information Team by contributing positively to communal goals and initiatives.


What You Bring

To excel as a Data and Management Information Analyst in this setting, you will bring proven experience in managing complex datasets within regulated environments—ideally within financial services or banking. Your background should reflect not only technical proficiency but also interpersonal strengths such as empathy, dependability, and a genuine commitment to supporting others. You will have demonstrated your ability to work collaboratively within teams while taking responsibility for individual deliverables. Your analytical mindset enables you to identify trends or anomalies quickly while your communication skills ensure that findings are shared constructively across departments.

Today, Saint Laurent collections include women’s and men’s ready-to-wear, shoes, handbags, small leather goods, jewelry, scarves, ties and eyewear.

In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is CA$121,100 - CA$221,900. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

This is a cross-functional role, working closely with Sales, Revenue Operations, Support, Marketing, and other teams to translate data into meaningful narratives, and self-service tools that improve operational efficiency and drive growth.

You’ll help internal teams across the business make decisions using data and visualizations. The ability to think on one’s feet, enjoy collaborating with highly technical teams, and be comfortable working asynchronously is essential.

Analyze sales pipeline, conversion rates, and customer acquisition metrics to identify trends and opportunities.
Develop and automate reporting workflows to improve team efficiency.
Create and maintain documentation of data sources, metrics definitions, and analysis methodologies.
Collaborate with stakeholders to define KPIs and success metrics for GTM initiatives, including product-led growth metrics (user acquisition, activation, retention, etc.) by developing data strategies to provide these insights.
Provide regular insights and recommendations to the leadership team.


What We Are Looking For


Experience at a high growth B2B SaaS company.
Strong understanding of go to market motions, sales metrics, and marketing metrics.
Knowledge of SQL, and widely used tools like Salesforce, Snowflake, and dbt.
Proficiency in data visualization tools (Tableau, Looker, metabase, etc).
Ability to give and process constructive feedback, as well as work independently.
Ability to communicate openly, supporting and championing innovation.
Flexibility to adjust to the dynamic nature of a startup, and adept at dealing with ambiguity.


As a company, we strive to maintain fair compensation practices within our team across all roles and all levels.

What We Offer


An inclusive, flexible environment where you can be your authentic self. We recognize the impact of diverse voices and backgrounds on the growth of our people, product, and company. And that flexibility in how and when you work empowers our team to integrate work and life.
A competitive total compensation package. This includes a base salary, an equity incentive plan and variable commission (for quota-based roles).
Comprehensive group benefits with no waiting period. Take advantage of coverage for health, vision, dental, and more for you and your family!
Remote first company—most of our teams work fully remotely. Enjoy a change of scenery wherever you can get wifi, participate in virtual and in-person social events, and leverage our corporate co-working program to visit WeWork (or other similar spaces near you). Some roles require in-office collaboration depending on team needs, which will be clearly noted in the job description.
Connect with other Tailscalars IRL. Attend our annual company retreat, participate in team/department off-sites, or use your individual travel budget to meet up with team members in Canada, the US, or the UK.
Support for your personal and professional development. Grow your career thoughtfully with $1500 USD annually for professional development, or take advantage of mentorship, coaching, and internal promotion opportunities.
Paid time off and a healthy work-life integration. Our flexible, paid time off program supports you for any situation life throws your way, whether moving homes or travelling the world!

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements



Travel:-

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Key Responsibilities:-


Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements

Our mission is to simplify team management and improve performance for restaurants, with a long-term vision of creating a thriving restaurant industry through the power of connected & engaged teams.




As the Data Analyst at 7shifts, reporting to the Manager of Data & Analytics, you will act as a dedicated partner to our Payroll and Tips teams. You’ll help them measure what matters, uncover meaningful insights, and identify opportunities to drive business impact. Your expertise will guide the development of KPIs, data best practices, research, reporting, and visualizations that inform decisions and move the team forward. You’ll also be supported by a collaborative data team, including other analysts, analytics engineers, data engineers, and leaders, who work together to enable data-driven decisions across the company.




What you’ll do:

Conduct in-depth analyses using SQL and BI tools to identify trends, measure performance, and uncover actionable insights
Build, maintain, and enhance dashboards and recurring reports that provide accurate, timely, and business-relevant information
Develop and maintain data models using dbt and SQL to transform raw data into clean, reliable, and scalable datasets for analysis and reporting
Partner with teams across the organization to understand data needs, define analytical approaches, and deliver data-driven recommendations
Provide timely ad hoc analyses and contribute to building self-serve data tools and resources that empower teams to independently explore and use data
Validate, reconcile, and troubleshoot data to ensure accuracy and reliability in reporting and decision-making
Effectively present findings and recommendations to both technical and non-technical audiences in a clear and actionable way




What you bring:

Hands-on experience with BI tools such as Tableau, Looker, or Power BI (bonus if you’ve used Thoughtspot)
Experience building and maintaining data models using dbt
Background in business, analytics, or a technical field
Proven ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams
Strong communication skills, with the ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical audiences
Experience working in a SaaS or tech environment




It’d be even cooler if you had:

Experience working with Snowflake as a data warehouse
Familiarity with event analytics tools like Mixpanel or Amplitude
Experience working with Salesforce or other CRM tools




Our commitment to our Shifties:

Opportunity: Our product is evolving in exciting ways, and we’re focused on delivering even more value to restaurants. This momentum creates real opportunities to learn and grow. Whether you’re honing your craft or exploring new paths, you’ll be supported and empowered to own your growth and impact a product shaping the future of the restaurant industry.
Challenge: We’re tackling real problems in a fast-moving, complex industry. The work is scrappy and ambiguous, but meaningful. You’ll think critically, act with intention, and shape solutions that make a real difference for restaurant teams.
Culture: We’re proud to be recognized among the best workplaces in North America. Guided by our mission and values, we move fast to solve meaningful problems and celebrate wins together. Whether through in-office and remote events, team offsites like Sparks, or everyday moments of connection, we create space for shared growth, collaboration, and fun.
Equity: We’re a Series C, VC-backed SaaS company, and we believe everyone should share in the success they help create. When we build together, we grow together.
Health and Wellness: We support Shifties in and outside of work, knowing that what people need can change over time. From day one, you’ll have access to benefits like health and dental, lifestyle spending accounts to a parental leave program built with flexibility in mind, to help you bring your best self to work.
Flexibility: Our team is intentional around how and where we work, whether remotely, in person, or a mix of both. We prioritize candidates who thrive in a hybrid work environment with offices in Saskatoon and Toronto, ensuring in-person collaboration and connection when possible. Plus, we offer a flexible vacation policy to encourage everyone to recharge when needed. Oh, and our ‘90 Day Shift’ program lets Shift work from (almost) anywhere because who wouldn’t want to trade their desk for a beach view once in a while?
Support: We set Shifties up for success with the tools they need, like the latest Apple tech, a home office setup, and some 7shifts swag to make it official. But support goes beyond day one. We’re serious about professional growth, offering coaching, feedback, development planning, and opportunities to grow from within.




We know you might not check every box, and that’s okay. If you’re excited about this role, inspired to contribute to a meaningful product, and eager to share ideas that drive real change, we’d love to hear from you. We’re building an inclusive team that reflects the diverse industry we serve, and we welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

We’re seeking a GCP Data Analyst with deep expertise in BigQuery, strong SQL and Python skills, and a sharp analytical mindset to support both data validation initiatives and ongoing analytics work. This role is ideal for someone who can navigate large datasets, build robust queries, and identify inconsistencies with precision and insight.

The analyst will work across a variety of data workflows, from validating metrics during system migrations to supporting day-to-day data analysis and reporting needs. You’ll leverage advanced BigQuery features—such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioning strategies, and time series analysis—to ensure data integrity and surface meaningful insights. Comfort working in Python with data frames and relevant packages is also essential, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation, anomaly detection, or prototyping workflows.

A solid understanding of data engineering fundamentals and GCP infrastructure is important, as is the ability to read and interpret code in Java or Scala when collaborating with engineering teammates. Familiarity with Airflow (Composer) will help you understand orchestration logic, though this won’t be a core responsibility. Experience with BigQuery ML, anomaly detection frameworks, or Vertex AI is a plus.

Write, optimize, and execute complex SQL queries in BigQuery to validate data accuracy, identify inconsistencies, and support analytics and reporting
Analyze large datasets to assess data quality, compare trends across systems, and surface anomalies or unexpected behaviors
Utilize advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitioned tables, and joins to support scalable, high-performance analysis
Use Python (including data frames and relevant libraries) for exploratory analysis, data manipulation, and supporting validation workflows
Support time series analysis and, where applicable, anomaly detection using SQL or Python-based approaches
Assist with load/transform validation to ensure reliability and accuracy in data pipelines
Collaborate with engineering teams to understand data pipelines, with basic ability to read and interpret Java or Scala code when needed
Perform side-by-side comparisons of data across systems to ensure consistency during and after migrations
Maintain basic familiarity with orchestration tools such as Airflow (Composer) to follow pipeline logic and collaborate effectively with engineering
Work within the GCP environment, leveraging cloud tools and services to support analysis, troubleshoot issues, and navigate cloud-based workflows
Clearly communicate analytical findings and data quality issues to cross-functional stakeholders to support decision-making



Qualifications:-


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field
5+ years of experience in data analyst or analytics engineering roles with strong BigQuery, SQL, and Python skills
5+ years of experience building and operating solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Strong ability to write and optimize SQL queries to validate data, analyze trends, and detect inconsistencies
Proficient in Python, including use of data frames and common analytical libraries
Experience with advanced BigQuery features such as authorized views, materialized views, UDFs, partitions, and time series analysis
Strong analytical skills and experience validating data across systems during migrations and ongoing operations
Basic ability to read and understand Java or Scala code to support engineering collaboration
Familiarity with Airflow (Cloud Composer) to interpret and trace data pipeline workflows



Nice to have:-


Familiarity with Looker or other BI tools for metric validation and reporting support
BigQuery ML and Vertex AI
Basic familiarity with legacy systems such as Oozie or Pig for reading existing scripts



Must have's:-


Proficiency in SQL, BigQuery, and Python
Advanced SQL skills in BigQuery for complex data validation, anomaly detection, and trend analysis
Experience comparing datasets across systems
Proven ability to identify and investigate data discrepancies across platforms
Strong analytical intuition to sense-check metrics and flag issues that may not trigger formal alerts
Ability to perform side-by-side metric and trend comparisons to confirm post-migration accuracy
Skilled in root cause analysis using SQL, domain expertise, and supporting context
Effective communicator who can document findings and share insights with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
Familiarity with time series analysis to detect unexpected shifts, drops, or spikes in metrics
Ability to follow structured validation processes while proactively identifying workflow improvements

The Position

Uplight is creating a new category of energy. We make software that manages energy resources in homes and businesses—including things like smart thermostats, electric vehicles, solar panels, storage batteries, heat pumps, and even people’s behavior—to generate, shift, or save energy to balance the grid, making it more efficient and reliable. This creates clean energy capacity that can be used by the power grid instead of burning more fossil fuels. Our solutions accelerate the transition to clean energy and save money for energy customers.

We are seeking a Data Engineer focusing on data platform enablement to support our mission and scale our impact

How You Will Make An Impact

As a Data Engineer at Uplight, you’ll play a central role in designing and maintaining the infrastructure that ingests, transforms, and delivers data across our platform. Your work ensures that data systems are reliable, scalable, observable, and cost-efficient—forming the backbone of many customer-facing and data science-driven solutions.

You’ll partner with cross-functional teams including analysts, product managers, and data scientists to ensure the platform meets the evolving needs of our business and our users.

What You Get To Do


Design, build, and maintain data pipelines using Databricks (Spark, Delta Lake) and Python.
Collaborate across teams to develop core platform capabilities—such as orchestration, metadata management, and data quality—delivering scalable, reusable solutions
Improve reliability and fault tolerance of ingest pipelines handling large volumes of utility data.
Build and support MLOps tooling, including data pipelines, model registries, and serving infrastructure
Participate in the full software development lifecycle: design, build, test, deploy, and support
Contribute to a remote-first team that values agility, collaboration, and clarity—favoring whiteboarding, async design docs, and reflective retros over rigid ceremonies.
Continuously learn and grow with support from senior engineers and team leads
Help maintain a team culture rooted in curiosity, empathy, and continuous improvement


What You Bring To Uplight


2–5 years of software engineering experience, ideally in backend or data-focused roles
Experience with Databricks, Spark, or similar big data technologies
Proficiency in Python and SQL
Exposure to cloud platforms such as GCP or AWS
Familiarity with CI/CD tools and infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Docker, Terraform, CircleCI)
Strong communication and collaboration skills; a team player excited to learn and grow


Bonus Points


Familiarity with MLOps concepts and tools (e.g., MLflow, model versioning)
Experience with real-time or streaming data systems (e.g., Kafka, Structured Streaming)
Understanding of data observability, lineage, and quality
Prior work in the energy or utility space
Strong grasp of Big Data challenges including cost vs performance tradeoffs


Don’t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women, marginalized genders and people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification. At Uplight we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.
