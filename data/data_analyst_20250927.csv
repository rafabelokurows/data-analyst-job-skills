Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Data Science at Stripe is a vibrant community where data analysts, data scientists and engineers learn and grow together. You will work with some of Stripe’s most fundamental and exciting data, and use that data to help drive company-wide initiatives. We have a variety of Data Analytics roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

In this role, you will partner deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. You will work closely with partners to extract insights from Stripe's rich and complex data. You will also work with leaders to translate business needs into data problems. You will build metrics, scalable data pipelines, dashboards, and reports to inform and run the business. You will deliver actionable business recommendations through analyses and data storytelling.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong statistical knowledge
Expertise in visualization and using data insights to make recommendations and achieve goals
Proven ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with great attention to detail

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Working remotely at Stripe

A remote location is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently live or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $146,900 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.

Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.

Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1.4B+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.

We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.

About The Role

Rippling is building the future of how businesses run — and our Data Cloud team is on a mission to give every customer a full-stack data platform to understand and operate their business, across every function: HR, IT, Finance, and beyond.

We’re looking for a Data Analyst to join our product team — but this isn’t your typical analyst role. You won’t be sitting in a silo writing dashboards for exec reviews. Instead, you’ll be at the center of how we dogfood our own analytics products, solve real reporting needs for our internal teams (starting with HR), and translate those solutions into customer-facing templates, recipes, and product feedback.

If you’re the kind of person who’s happiest when you’re deep in SQL one minute, building dashboards the next, and collaborating with product managers to make tools better the minute after that — this is your role.

What You Will Do


Support internal reporting use cases: Be the go-to person for Rippling’s internal HR reporting needs — helping them define the right metrics, write the SQL, and build clean dashboards using our own reporting tools.
Productize real solutions: Take the reports and dashboards you build for internal teams and turn them into recipes or templates that any Rippling customer can use.
Shape the future of the product: Because you’ll be living in our product every day, you’ll become a key voice for what’s working and what’s not — surfacing gaps, proposing improvements, and even influencing the roadmap.
Be the “power user” of our data stack: Our team builds everything from ingestion to transformation to dashboards. You’ll be working across this full stack, helping make it more usable and scalable through your daily work.
Drive self-serve analytics adoption: Help internal teams (starting with HR) reduce their dependence on ad hoc requests by building the right dashboards and templates to unlock self-serve.


What Success Looks Like


Internal teams can get the reports they need faster — and without asking twice.
Your dashboards become models for how customers solve similar reporting problems.
Your feedback helps us make major product improvements.
We ship better data products because you’ve helped us dogfood our own tools thoroughly and thoughtfully.
You are seen as both a trusted reporting partner and a product-minded analyst who can bridge internal needs and customer-facing solutions.


What You Will Need


3+ years working with data.
Proficiency in SQL and hands-on experience with data exploration and dashboarding tools (Looker, Mode, Tableau, etc.).
A strong sense of product empathy — you don’t just solve the problem, you think about how others could solve it too.
Experience working with People, HR, or GTM teams is a plus.
Comfort navigating ambiguity, unstructured questions, and imperfect data.
Bonus: familiarity with dbt, analytics engineering, or data governance principles.


Why This Role Is Special

This role lives inside the product team, not on a siloed analytics team. That means:


Your work directly informs how we build and improve our data products.
You’re empowered to propose ideas, templates, and workflows based on real usage.
You get to see immediate impact — both internally and externally — from what you build.


This is a great fit for someone who wants to stay hands-on with data, but also get exposure to product development and influence what we ship.

Apply if…


You love using data to unlock clarity for others.
You get excited by operational reporting — not just vanity metrics.
You want to be part of a team building powerful tools and using them every day.
You’re curious, self-directed, and opinionated about what great looks like.

Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.<br><br><strong>About The Role<br><br></strong>Rippling is building the future of how businesses run — and our Data Cloud team is on a mission to give every customer a full-stack data platform to understand and operate their business, across every function: HR, IT, Finance, and beyond.<br><br>We’re looking for a Data Analyst to join our product team — but this isn’t your typical analyst role. You won’t be sitting in a silo writing dashboards for exec reviews. Instead, you’ll be at the center of how we dogfood our own analytics products, solve real reporting needs for our internal teams (starting with HR), and translate those solutions into customer-facing templates, recipes, and product feedback.<br><br>If you’re the kind of person who’s happiest when you’re deep in SQL one minute, building dashboards the next, and collaborating with product managers to make tools better the minute after that — this is your role.<br><br><strong>What You Will Do<br><br></strong><ul><li>Support internal reporting use cases: Be the go-to person for Rippling’s internal HR reporting needs — helping them define the right metrics, write the SQL, and build clean dashboards using our own reporting tools. </li><li>Productize real solutions: Take the reports and dashboards you build for internal teams and turn them into recipes or templates that any Rippling customer can use. </li><li>Shape the future of the product: Because you’ll be living in our product every day, you’ll become a key voice for what’s working and what’s not — surfacing gaps, proposing improvements, and even influencing the roadmap. </li><li>Be the “power user” of our data stack: Our team builds everything from ingestion to transformation to dashboards. You’ll be working across this full stack, helping make it more usable and scalable through your daily work. </li><li>Drive self-serve analytics adoption: Help internal teams (starting with HR) reduce their dependence on ad hoc requests by building the right dashboards and templates to unlock self-serve. <br><br></li></ul><strong>What Success Looks Like<br><br></strong><ul><li>Internal teams can get the reports they need faster — and without asking twice. </li><li>Your dashboards become models for how customers solve similar reporting problems. </li><li>Your feedback helps us make major product improvements. </li><li>We ship better data products because you’ve helped us dogfood our own tools thoroughly and thoughtfully. </li><li>You are seen as both a trusted reporting partner and a product-minded analyst who can bridge internal needs and customer-facing solutions. <br><br></li></ul><strong>What You Will Need<br><br></strong><ul><li>3+ years working with data. </li><li>Proficiency in SQL and hands-on experience with data exploration and dashboarding tools (Looker, Mode, Tableau, etc.). </li><li>A strong sense of product empathy — you don’t just solve the problem, you think about how others could solve it too. </li><li>Experience working with People, HR, or GTM teams is a plus. </li><li>Comfort navigating ambiguity, unstructured questions, and imperfect data. </li><li>Bonus: familiarity with dbt, analytics engineering, or data governance principles. <br><br></li></ul><strong><strong>Why This Role Is Special<br><br></strong></strong>This role lives inside the product team, not on a siloed analytics team. That means:<br><br><ul><li>Your work directly informs how we build and improve our data products. </li><li>You’re empowered to propose ideas, templates, and workflows based on real usage. </li><li>You get to see immediate impact — both internally and externally — from what you build. <br><br></li></ul>This is a great fit for someone who wants to stay hands-on with data, but also get exposure to product development and influence what we ship.<br><br><strong><strong>Apply if…<br><br></strong></strong><ul><li>You love using data to unlock clarity for others. </li><li>You get excited by operational reporting — not just vanity metrics. </li><li>You want to be part of a team building powerful tools and using them every day. </li><li>You’re curious, self-directed, and opinionated about what great looks like. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Additional Information<br><br></strong>Rippling is an equal opportunity employer.

The User Operations team is central to ensuring that our customers' experience with our products is nothing short of exceptional. We resolve complex issues, provide technical guidance, and support customers in maximizing value and adoption from deploying our products. We work closely with Sales, Technical Success, Product, Engineering and others to deliver the best possible experience to our customers at scale. OpenAI's customers represent a range of diverse backgrounds and maturity, from early-stage startups to established global enterprises. Given OpenAI’s breakneck shipping cadence and growth—and the expectation that it will only accelerate—transforming our rich support data into real‑time insights and scalable, self‑serve analytics is critical to sustaining exceptional customer experiences on the path to AGI.

About The Role

We’re seeking a User Operations Data Analyst who will dig deep into user‑support data—surfacing trends, volumes, and friction signals—and turn these findings into actionable insights and always‑on reporting. You’ll design, build, and maintain self‑serve dashboards that keep every stakeholder informed in real time, partnering closely with Data Science and Engineering to ensure clean pipelines, robust models, and scalable tooling. Think proactive friction detection and real‑time service‑health views that help us stay ahead of demand—delivering decision‑grade insights, not just prettier slide decks.

This role is based in San Francisco, California. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In This Role, You Will


Explore large support and product datasets to uncover trends, volume drivers, and user‑experience pain points, distilling findings into clear, actionable narratives.
Build, enhance, and maintain self‑serve dashboards and reporting tools, enabling non‑technical teams to answer their own data questions.
Establish a unified metrics taxonomy for service‑health and performance—and build automated data‑sharing pipelines and scorecards with our BPO partners to ensure everyone operates from the same real‑time view of success
Leverage LLMs to build bespoke classifiers that automatically label and segment inbound volumes—powering smarter routing, richer self‑serve insights, and swifter root‑cause analysis.
Partner with Data Engineering to ensure reliable pipelines, implement data‑quality checks, and document sources of truth.
Jump into high‑priority special projects to conduct bespoke deep‑dive analyses and deliver clear, strategic recommendations to leadership.
Prototype quickly—leveraging ChatGPT, Jupyter notebooks, Retool, and other tools—to prove value before hardening with Engineering.
Collaborate with Data Science on predictive models and experimentation, translating results into operational recommendations.


You Might Thrive In This Role If You


8 + years in analytics, business intelligence, or data science, ideally supporting customer support or operations teams.
Expert‑level SQL skills and proficiency in Python or R for advanced analysis and automation
Hands‑on experience designing and maintaining BI dashboards (e.g. Looker, Mode, Tableau, Sundial) with a focus on clarity and self‑serve usability.
Hands‑on experience fine‑tuning or prompt‑engineering LLMs to build text classifiers, sentiment analysis, or tagging systems.
Demonstrated ability to translate complex datasets into clear business stories and recommendations for both technical and non‑technical audiences.
Familiarity with support metrics (SLAs, FCR, deflection) and ability to define service health KPIs.
Strong cross‑functional communication skills—comfortable collaborating daily with engineers, data scientists, and operations leaders.
An eye for detail, a zero‑defect mindset, and a bias toward action over theoretical perfection
Possess a strong bias for automation and can defend governance decisions that keep data and processes healthy as they grow.
Thrive in a fast‑moving, ambiguous environment where priorities can shift quickly.

Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.

In-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays. This internship will take place from January – April or May – September (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our SF or NYC office during this time.

About The Role

Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means a million people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion. This is where you come in. You will be one of our first data science interns and will help us forge a performant and reliable path forward to Notion's future.

During your 12-week internship, you will be paired with a mentor that will help guide you as you work closely with our team to build and ship impactful projects. These projects will drive valuable impact to our customers.

What You'll Achieve


Conduct data analyses to gain insights about Notion and use these insights to uncover opportunities for improvements in our product and business.
Communicate these insights with actionable recommendations to cross-functional teams (insights are useful, impact is even better!).
Work with cross-functional partners across the product and business to learn about their functions and use data to advance their respective areas.
Create metrics and build dashboards to monitor the growth and health of Notion.
Communicate insights and recommendations effectively to leadership and have an impact on strategic decision-making.


Qualifications


Pursuing a bachelor's or master's in a quantitative field such as Economics, Statistics, Applied Math, Engineering, Computer Science, or Natural Sciences. Targeting a full time start date prior to Summer 2027.
This internship will take place from January – April (for winter) or May – September (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our SF or NYC office during this time.
Previous data science internship experience.
Proficient in SQL for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
Working towards proficiency in one or more scripting languages such as Python or R.
You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving them.
You are able to problem-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.


Skills You'll Need To Bring


Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
Willingness to learn: If you haven't worked in the SaaS productivity tool space before or have never analyzed an A/B test, you are open to acquiring the necessary domain knowledge and skills to contribute.
Balance work quality and speed: You can deliver high-quality, accurate analyses while recognizing that the goal is to influence business decisions rather than achieve perfect measurement.
Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.


Nice To Haves


You have previous intern experience working with product, engineering, or GTM teams.
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.


Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.

Designed with simplicity in mind, Verkada's six product lines — video security cameras, access control, environmental sensors, alarms, workplace, and intercoms — provide unparalleled building security through an integrated, cloud-based software platform. Over 33,500 organizations, including 96 companies in the Fortune 500, across 93 countries worldwide trust Verkada as their physical security layer for easier management, intelligent control, and scalable deployments. Founded in 2016 with more than $700M in funding raised to-date, Verkada has expanded rapidly with 15 offices and 2,200+ full-time employees.

About The Role

We are looking for an exceptional Sr. People Analytics Associate to join our growing People team. This role will partner with our Sr. Director of People Strategy and Operations to continue building and scaling our people analytics capability. This is a high-impact role for someone who’s excited to partner with People, Sales, Finance, and Executive teams to unlock insights that drive strategic talent decisions, improve employee experience, and support business growth.

What You'll Do


As a member of our People Strategy and Operations team, you will have an integral role in driving the insights, operations, and strategy. This role blends technical expertise, business acumen, and a passion for storytelling through data.
You will continue building the foundation for people analytics, including data pipelines, dashboards, and reporting standards across systems like Workday, Looker, Greenhouse, and Lattice.
You will partner closely with People Partners and business leaders to identify key metrics and deliver actionable insights across the employee lifecycle (e.g., hiring, attrition, engagement, organization health)
You will also partner with Recruiting Operations and Talent Aquision leaders to design and maintain recruiting analytics dashboards that provide visibility into key metrics (e.g., pipeline health, time-to-fill, source effectiveness) and equip leaders to make data-driven hiring decisions.
You will drive cross-functional analytics projects that support strategic decisions on org design, retention, performance, and compensation.
You will maintain a strong data governance framework to ensure accuracy, privacy, and consistency across systems and reporting.


What You Bring


Since we’re still in scrappy startup mode, you’ll need to be a high-impact self-starter. You take initiative to move projects forward and can operate well with little guidance.
Raw Smarts: You’ve fine-tuned your first principle and conceptual problem-solving skills. You can look at complex problems and solve them from start to finish.
Strong analytical skills: you nerd out about data, can quickly structure analyses to answer key business questions to drive decision-making, and will also have perspectives on building the right data architecture. Advanced Excel and Google Sheets skills, with experience building and managing complex data models and calculations.
Technical capabilities: Proven experience designing data warehouses and dashboards (e.g., Looker, Workday, BigQuery), working with SQL, and integrating data across People systems.
Flexibility and hustle: You manage change and ambiguity well, and have no problems juggling multiple priorities while executing in a fast-paced environment. You’re comfortable pivoting quickly and often.
5+ years of experience in people analytics, workforce strategy, or business analytics, ideally in a high-growth or tech environment.

Type: Full-Time

Compensation: Competitive salary + early-stage equity

Backed by 8VC, we’re building a world-class team to tackle one of the industry's most critical infrastructure problems.

About The Role

We’re building an AI-native platform where industrial data becomes actionable through semantic enrichment, intelligent agents, and governed interoperability. At the heart of this architecture lies our Data Fabric — an intelligent, governed layer that unifies fragmented and siloed data streams into knowledge graphs ready for high context decision-making and agentic execution.

The Data Partnerships Analyst will be on the front lines of this strategy: researching, evaluating, and supporting partnerships with leading data providers (trade, compliance, entity mapping, financial, ESG, geopolitical, etc). You’ll play a critical role in mapping data ecosystems, structuring partnerships, and ensuring Fabrion’s platform is powered by the most complete, high-quality, and strategically differentiated data.

This role is ideal for someone with sharp analytical skills, a curiosity for data-driven businesses, and a strong interest in how AI and partnerships intersect to transform global value chains.

Responsibilities


Market Landscaping & Research: Identify, track, and evaluate relevant data providers across global markets.
Deal Support: Assist in structuring partnership discussions, including preparing briefs, evaluating contract terms, and surfacing risks or dependencies.
Data Evaluation: Assess sample datasets for coverage, quality, refresh frequency, schema design, and interoperability with Fabrion’s knowledge graphs.
Partnership Pipeline: Maintain CRM-style tracking of outreach, engagements, and deal status across priority providers.
Competitive Intelligence: Benchmark competitors’ data strategies and build landscape views of potential threats and opportunities.
Cross-Team Collaboration: Work with product, engineering and legal teams to translate data partnership requirements into technical and contractual frameworks.


Core Experience

What We’re Looking For


3+ years experience in research, consulting, corporate strategy, business development or partnerships.
Experience in the automotive industry, particularly at an OEM and/or Tier 1 supplier, is a huge plus.
Strong analytical skills; comfort with messy datasets, Excel/Sheets, and SQL/Python basics.
Excellent communication and synthesis skills — able to distill complex market landscapes into crisp takeaways.
Exposure to B2B SaaS, data vendors, or enterprise technology ecosystems preferred.


Mindset


Systems thinker: curious about how fragmented datasets connect into real-world decision and execution systems.
Comfortable navigating ambiguity and building processes from scratch.
High ownership: proactive, organized, and reliable in pushing workstreams forward.
Excited to work closely with founders and investors in a fast-paced, high-stakes environment.


Bonus Skills


Prior experience evaluating or working with data providers (e.g., S&P, D&B, etc).
Understanding of trade data, entity mapping, risk and compliance frameworks (REACH, RoHS, ESG, sanctions).
Familiarity with data licensing, APIs, or data feeds.
Prior exposure to supply chain, automotive, or industrial domains.


Why This Role Matters

Our platform’s intelligence is only as strong as the data it is built on. The Data Partnerships Analyst helps ensure Fabrion gains early access to the most critical and differentiated data sources.

This role gives you direct exposure to startup founders, investors, and senior executives at leading data providers. You’ll develop a unique perspective at the intersection of data, AI, and industrial transformation, while shaping the partnerships that power Fabrion’s AI agents.

If you’re excited to map the global data landscape, help secure strategic partnerships, and build the foundation of an AI-native enterprise platform, we’d love to hear from you!

About Onos Health

Onos Health’s mission is simple but ambitious: ensure every healthcare dollar goes toward delivering the highest quality care. Today, 30% of total U.S. healthcare spending is wasted due to ineffective care and administrative burden caused by misalignment between providers and payers.

Onos is addressing this by building the largest AI-driven healthcare data platform. Our models enables payers to make faster, more accurate decisions across their populations. By guiding members to the right care, Onos is channeling more dollars to high-quality care that drives outcomes while making healthcare more affordable.

Onos recently closed a $6M Seed round with top-tier investors and is already working with some of the nation’s largest health plans, signing its first national plan just months after launch.

Come join a category-defining company and help reimagine healthcare for the better.

Why Onos?


Meaningful impact: Help fix what is fundamentally broken in healthcare
Direct collaboration: Work alongside experienced founders with deep healthcare and data expertise
Culture: Join a high-performing, transparent, and results-oriented team
Ownership: Significant responsibility and autonomy from day one
Opportunity: Play a pivotal role in building a fast-growing, category-defining healthcare AI company


The Role

We’re looking for a Healthcare Data Analyst who thrives in a fast-moving startup, loves working with messy healthcare data, and gets things done. This is not a siloed analyst role; you’ll partner closely with product, engineering, and client-facing teams to turn data into insights that directly shape how payers manage care.

As Onos’ first data analyst, you’ll not only work hands-on with claims, clinical, and operational data to build analyses and dashboards, but also lay the foundation for our data analytics infrastructure. You will take the lead in building analyses and dashboards that uncover waste, identify care gaps, and generate insights that directly inform our product roadmap and drive continuous improvement.

What you'll be doing at Onos:


Data Exploration & Analysis: Dive deep into claims and clinical data to uncover trends, outliers, and actionable insights.
Client Delivery: Build and deliver analyses that highlight opportunities to reduce waste, improve care, and demonstrate value to payers.
Product Insights: Partner with product, engineering, and clinical teams to translate findings into product features, workflows, and automation.
Dashboards & Reporting: Design and maintain clear, impactful dashboards that track performance and outcomes.
Collaboration: Work closely with the CEO, CPO, and client teams to shape narratives and outcomes for health plan executives.


What we're looking for:


5+ years of experience as a data analyst (healthcare, health plans, or clinical data experience very strongly preferred)
Strong SQL and data wrangling skills; comfortable working with large, messy datasets
Familiarity with healthcare data standards (claims, eligibility, EHR/clinical data, coding sets like ICD, CPT, HCPCS)
Experience building dashboards (Looker, Tableau, PowerBI, or similar) and communicating insights clearly
Proven ability to “own” both analysis and execution
Scrappy with an entrepreneurial mindset: resourceful, proactive, thrives in ambiguity, and moves fast
Excellent communication skills an ability to translate complex data into clear business insights
Exceptional references from colleagues and former managers


Benefits And Perks


Flexible hybrid arrangement: 2-3 days/week at San Francisco office (Financial District)
Unlimited vacation policy
Paid parental leave
Medical, dental, and vision insurance
Pre-tax commuter benefits
401(k)
Significant equity as an early employee
Direct mentorship from experienced founders
Ground-floor opportunity to help build a team and culture
Regular team events and offsites
Company-provided equipment and home office setup


We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Compensation Range: $150K - $180K
