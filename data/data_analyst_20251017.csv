We’re a UK housing association committed to a new vision – providing homes people love to live in.

With over 38,000 homes in management across London and southern England, we provide a wide range of homes for social, affordable and private rent, specialist housing services, as well as homes for sale and shared ownership.

Our 70,000 customers have diverse backgrounds and levels of income and we’re here to provide all of them with homes that are safe, high quality and sustainable. And with social housing roots going back eight decades, we continue to ensure that every penny of profit we make is reinvested into our charitable social purpose – delivering more homes and better services for customers.

We’re also members of the G15, a group of leading housing associations that work together to house one in ten Londoners and tackle the housing crisis.

Produce dashboards, scorecards, and narrative reports that clearly communicate insights to non-technical People Services and senior stakeholders. Help People services and business leaders interpret data and embed insight into decision-making
Use advanced analytics techniques (e.g. predictive modelling, segmentation, regression) to provide forward-looking insight, not just descriptive reporting
Support cyclical processes (performance, reward, pay gap reporting) by producing reports and analysis to highlight key themes and implications.


Data Quality & Governance


Partner with the Data team and colleagues to ensure People data is accurate, consistent, and well-governed and ensure adherence to the hub and spoke framework to certify datasets
Work with the People Services Systems Manager to conduct UAT testing of People Services systems, process data, and support the People Services Systems team
Monitor data quality, identifying root causes of issues and recommending process improvements
Act as People Services’s data steward, ensuring GDPR compliance, robust governance, and high data quality by managing People data assets, maintaining integrity and security, and representing People services in data stewardship meetings


Innovation & Continuous Improvement


Develop and enhance the use of analytics tools (e.g. Power BI, SQL & Excel) to improve reporting and insight capability
Proactively seek opportunities to automate standard reporting and free capacity for deeper analysis
Stay up to date with external trends in People analytics, benchmarking, and regulatory reporting, bringing new ideas into People Services
Work closely with People Business Partners and senior managers to understand their needs, framing analysis that answers business questions
Educate stakeholders on how to use data effectively to improve decision-making and operational efficiency.


More About You

Radius is a global business services company operating in 19 countries across five continents. Founded in 1990, we’ve grown from a successful fuel card business in North West England into a trusted provider of fleet and connectivity solutions for businesses of all sizes.

Our mission is to help companies adapt to market changes and seize new opportunities through integrated, scalable services.

Job Description

We are seeking an experienced Data Analyst to join our central Data Services & Reporting (DS&R) team.

This role is ideal for a data professional with at least two years commercial experience using SQL and Tableau to deliver impactful insights across a diverse business.

You’ll collaborate with stakeholders across all eight divisions of Radius, helping to shape data-driven decisions and improve reporting processes.

While experience with Salesforce reporting is advantageous, it is not essential - we offer support and development in this area.

This is a fully office-based role, located at our Radius Campus HQ in Crewe, Cheshire.

Objectives


Deliver accurate, insightful reporting solutions through agile development and service desk support.
Promote adoption of automated, self-service reporting tools across the business.
Support the broader Radius Data Strategy through training, stakeholder engagement, and continuous improvement.
Work collaboratively to enhance team performance and drive innovation in reporting.


Key Responsibilities


Design and deliver reporting solutions using Tableau and SQL, aligned with business needs and team standards.
Engage directly with stakeholders to gather requirements, understand business processes, and manage small projects to support reporting delivery.
Support the Data Service Desk on a rota basis (2-4 hours per week), providing quick development fixes and guidance to business teams.
Collaborate with DS&R colleagues, IT, and Radius business units on larger, cross-functional data projects.
Contribute to team development, process improvement, and overall wellbeing within DS&R.


What We’re Looking For


Minimum of two years’ commercial experience in a data analyst role.
Strong SQL skills and a commitment to further development in data analytics.
Proven experience with Tableau.
Ability to work with stakeholders to refine requirements and deliver actionable insights.
Analytical mindset with attention to detail and a curiosity for understanding business context.
Familiarity with Salesforce dashboards and reporting is a plus, but not required.


Additional Information

Your impact on Radius will be rewarded with the opportunity to develop and progress your career in many directions.

You’ll also have access to our competitive reward and benefits package, which includes:


Pension
Life assurance
Performance-related bonus scheme
Employee fuel card scheme
Electric Vehicle scheme
Employee assistance programme
Wellness and healthcare assistance via ‘Help@Hand’ by Unum
‘Cycle to work’ scheme
Free breakfast daily in the office


And of course, you will be part of a modern purpose-built space in Crewe that will provide you with an outstanding working environment complete with gym, café, games rooms, and more!

Allica is the UK’s fastest growing company - and the fastest-growing financial technology (Fintech) firm ever. Our purpose is to help established SMEs, one of the last major underserved opportunities in Fintech.




Established SMEs are the backbone of local communities - representing over a third of our economy - yet have been largely neglected both by traditional high street banks and modern fintech providers.




Department Description

Our vision is to reimagine Relationship Banking for established SMEs, through the very best people, products and digital tools. We don’t pretend to have all the answers yet, and you will play a role in continuing to shape our offering.




Our Relationship Manager team was formed in 2022 and continues to grow with the Bank at pace. Providing every customer who opens an account with us with a Relationship Manager, to work alongside them and provide outstanding service, is core to our strategy.

In addition to providing outstanding service, our Relationship Managers build deep levels of understanding and trust with their customers, and get to understand their ambitions, goals and motivations. Allica Relationship Managers support their customers through the provision of appropriate Allica Bank products including Business Current Accounts, Savings Accounts, Commercial Loans, Asset Finance and Working Capital Facilities.




All Relationship Manager roles at Allica Bank carry a requirement for new business acquisition as we continue to build the bank. Where portfolios are held, they are built to allow capacity to do this. Relationship Managers will bring, and continue to build, a strong network of trusted SME advisors such as accountants, solicitors, business organisations and others (but not commercial finance brokers – these are looked after by our dedicated broker team). We expect our Relationship Managers to be recognised as valued partners and experts in business finance by their clients and in the communities they serve.




Principal Accountabilities

Relationship Manage a portfolio of SME customers, understanding customer’s needs and business aspirations, and looking for opportunities to support them via Allica Bank services and through their own external networks
Originating SME lending opportunities for both existing and new customers from initial enquiry through to completion, including writing credit papers in line with Allica’s credit policy and appetite.
Delivering the business plan for your local area, and actively managing your objectives and personal development plan.
Making your colleagues proud that you represent Allica in your local area, by ensuring excellent service for local SME customers, prospects and advisors.
Working closely and collaboratively with all areas of Allica to ensure a seamless and professional service is always provided.
Being a positive contributor to Allica’s culture, and always demonstrating the bank’s values
Complying with all mandatory policies, and adherence to operational procedures to maintain internal controls.




Personal Attributes & Experience

Highly capable Relationship Manager and Business Developer with a long-term track record of building high-value, trust based and long-lasting referral relationships.
You will need to have a strong understanding of SME banking, which must include a background in commercial lending.
You will be able to demonstrate a history of exemplary level of service, and of maximising the value with prospects and customers.
You will be able to demonstrate a passion for SMEs, be a self-starter and bring an entrepreneurial mindset to your work.
You will have excellent interpersonal and communication skills together with evidence of strong career progression and/or outperformance.
You’ll be able to evidence an ability to work expertly with customers, colleagues and advisors to structure new lending proposals and write credit applications.
You’ll have a proven track record in providing excellent customer service, and in generating new income opportunities whilst effectively managing credit risk.
You’ll demonstrate an ability to analyse and review financial accounts and associated information.




Working at Allica Bank

At Allica Bank we want to ensure our employees have the right tools and environment in which to succeed in their role and in support of our customers.

Our employees are at the heart of everything we do, so our benefits are designed with you in mind:

Full onboarding support and continued development opportunities
Options for flexible working
Regular social activities
Pension contributions
Discretionary bonus scheme
Private health cover
Life assurance
Family friendly policies including enhanced Maternity & Paternity leave




Don’t tick every box?

Don’t worry if you don’t have all the skills or requirements listed on the job description. If you think you’ll be a good fit, we’d still love to hear from you!

Flexible working

We know the ‘9-to-5’ isn’t right for everyone. That’s why Allica Bank is fully committed to flexible and hybrid working. Please let us know what is best for you and, if we can, we will do our best to accommodate.

Diversity

We’re a diverse bunch here at Allica, with all kinds of experiences, backgrounds and lifestyles. Our openness and differences make us stronger, and we want everybody to feel comfortable bringing as much of themselves to work with them as they like.

Strategy Analyst Graduate - Nottingham

Salary: £50,000 plus a £5,000 joining bonus and other benefits

Location: Nottingham only

Start date: 14th September 2026

Eligibility: Open to any final year students graduating in 2026, or those who have graduated in 2025. (This includes undergraduates, masters and PhD students)

Sponsorship: We’re able to sponsor if you currently have the right to work in the UK (including student/graduate visas)

Closing date: 3rd November 2025 (subject to close early)

As we recruit on a rolling basis, we recommend applying as soon as you can

Developing the strategy behind our success. That's one good thing.

At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change credit – one good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference – to our customers, our colleagues and community.

Our Strategy Teams Are Fundamental In How We Drive The Business Forward, But Most Importantly, How We Solve Problems And Work With Our Customers. As a Strategy Analyst You Could Be


Finding innovative ways to attract new customers and ensure our products meet their needs.
Providing support and tools to help our customers manage their finances and protect them from fraud.
Creating marketing strategies that get the right messages across in the right places.
Striking the right balance in the lending we do and the risk to the business.


Key to all this work is insightful data analysis and critical judgement skills. You will be trained and developed on coding and analytical tools - enabling you to really dig deep into the datasets.

Because of this exciting range of work, rotations are a core part of the role. In return, this allows you to develop your skills and knowledge across a range of projects and business areas, supporting you in becoming a well rounded Strategy Analyst.

One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that Capital One is an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and you’ll have a manager, mentor and buddy for support as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams. We’ve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our former CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate, led the UK business, and is now an Executive Vice President for Capital One Enterprise! And that’s just one of many success stories.

What You’ll Need

We don’t mind what degree background or grades you have, but we want to see:


Your ability to identify solutions or opportunities using data and sound reasoning.
A strong aptitude for maths, and that you can apply problem solving and creative thinking to come up with suitable recommendations.
How you use your judgement within decision making.
You have strong written and verbal communication skills.
You aren’t afraid to share your ideas and you thrive in a collaborative environment.
You have a curiosity to learn and take ownership of your development.
Whilst also being focused on growth and development – yours and ours.


The Recruitment Process

Step 1: Apply! We don’t screen CV’s so there’s no need to tailor your CV or attach a cover letter. After your initial application, if you meet the eligibility criteria you will be sent out online testing to complete, which assess the core skills required for the role.

Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview

Step 3: You’ll get to (virtually) meet with one of our Strategy Analysts to complete a case study interview

Step 4: The in person assessment day, which consists of a group activity, case study and individual interview. A great chance for you to have a look around our office and see the working environment!

What’s in it for you?


Outstanding learning and career development through our Capital One Develop UK training programmes (and appropriate external providers)
Core benefits including a pension scheme, bonus, generous holidays, private medical insurance. Flexible benefits including season-ticket loans and cycle to work scheme
Open-plan workspaces and accessible facilities designed to support and inspire you, including a fully serviced gym, subsidised restaurant, mindfulness and games rooms
Plenty of volunteering opportunities to give back to the community through our community impact and investment programmes
Regular social events run by our GradComm team, as well as an annual company-wide summer festival and christmas party
You can even help to shape how our early careers programmes look for future graduates by joining one of our working groups or becoming a buddy/mentor yourself


Where And How You'll Work

This is a permanent position based at our Nottingham office.

We have a hybrid working model which gives you flexibility to work from our offices and from home. We’re big on collaboration and connection, so you’ll be based in our Nottingham office 3 days a week on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.

That’s why we make our recruitment process fair and accessible.

We are committed to creating teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We welcome applications from everyone, and would particularly love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry, such as women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.

We Also Partner With Organisations Including The Women In Finance And Race At Work Charters, Stonewall And UpReach To Find People From Every Walk Of Life And Help Them Thrive With Us. We Have a Whole Host Of Internal Networks And Support Groups You Could Be Involved In, To Name a Few

Job Title: Research Assistant

School of Medicine

Fixed-term post

Applications are invited for a motivated Research Assistant to join the School of Medicine and support an exciting study led by Dr Natalie Shur “Investigating Mechanisms of Knee Pain Improvement in Individuals with Obesity Undergoing Weight Loss: A Pilot Study on Radiological, Metabolic, and Intra-Articular Microenvironment Change”.

This project, funded by the BMA Foundation, Doris Hillier Grant, aims to investigate the mechanisms by which weight loss improves knee pain in individuals with obesity recently prescribed glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. The study will investigate changes in knee pain and function longitudinally in patients undergoing weight loss, as well as knee cartilage thickness and strain using MRI, inflammatory biomarkers, and the synovial fluid microenvironment in a subgroup of individuals. It will utilise advanced imaging techniques, metabolic assessment, and proteomic analysis. By studying both biomechanical and metabolic processes, this research will provide new insights into the mechanisms driving pain relief and may inform future non-surgical treatment strategies for knee osteoarthritis.

About The Role

The Research Assistant will play a central role in:


Longitudinal data collection via online survey
Recruiting participants and running study visits including acquisition of imaging and assistance with biological sample collection.
Managing data with accuracy and integrity.
Contributing to advanced imaging analysis (MRI, MR Spectroscopy, musculoskeletal ultrasound).
Supporting data analysis, manuscript preparation, and presentation of findings.


You will be working in a multidisciplinary environment with musculoskeletal clinicians and scientists based in the Academic Unit of Injury, Recovery and Inflammation Sciences (IRIS) and physicists working in the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre. The post will be of particular interest to people wishing to develop their experience in translational musculoskeletal research.

The role is offered on a part time basis over 18 months at 0.5FTE, however we will accept a higher FTE. Please specify your preferred hours in your application. This post is offered on a fixed term basis.

About You

We are looking for a candidate who is:


Highly organised with excellent attention to detail.
Able to work effectively with human research participants.
Interested in musculoskeletal health, obesity, imaging, and metabolic science.
Keen to contribute to high-impact research with real clinical relevance.


You must have a BSc or equivalent experience in a relevant health related discipline (physiotherapy, sport and exercise science, clinical sciences, anatomy) and be experienced in a variety of quantitative research methodologies involving human participants. Additional desirable criteria include an MSc in a related subject e.g. Sport and Exercise Medicine or working towards PhD in relevant subject area.

Interviews will take place on Wednesday, 5th November.

If you have any questions about this role, please contact Dr Natalie Shur (natalie.shur@nottingham.ac.uk). Please note that applications sent directly to this email address will not be accepted.

In order to process applications without delay, we will be sending a Criminal Record Check to Disclosure and Barring Service on your behalf.

However, we recognise in exceptional circumstances some candidates will want to send their completed forms direct. If you will be doing this, please advise Government Recruitment Service of your intention by emailing Pre-EmploymentChecks.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk stating the job reference number in the subject heading.

Please note: in addition to the standard pre-employment checks for appointment into the Civil Service, all candidates must also obtain National Security Vetting at Security Check (SC) clearance level for this vacancy. You will normally need to meet the minimum UK residency period as determined by the level of vetting being undertaken, which for SC is 5 years UK residency prior to your vetting application. If you have any questions about this residency requirement, please speak to the vacancy holder for this post.

For further information on National Security Vetting please visit the Demystifying Vetting website.

Applicants who are successful at interview will be, as part of pre-employment screening, subject to a check on the Internal Fraud Database (IFD). This check will provide information about employees who have been dismissed for fraud or dishonesty offences. This check also applies to employees who resign or otherwise leave before being dismissed for fraud or dishonesty had their employment continued. Any applicant’s details held on the IFD will be refused employment.

A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5 year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.

At Litera, we’re on a mission to Raise The Bar™️ for the legal profession by delivering transformational and globally-trusted solutions to law firms and corporate legal teams worldwide. We’ve been a leader in legal tech innovation for 30 years and are leading the legal AI revolution to this day with most of the world’s largest law firms as our clients. If you’re passionate about building AI-forward solutions that scale globally and want your work to impact millions of legal professionals worldwide, this is your opportunity to be part of an extraordinary team that’s elevating the craft of law.

This position is located in our Nottingham, UK office. Candidates should reside within reasonable commuting distance, as this role requires on-site presence at least three days per week. This hybrid approach enables us to build a collaborative and innovative work environment while maintaining the flexibility that supports both productivity and work-life balance.

Position Overview

As a Senior Technical Support Engineer at Litera, you will own end-to-end case management across the entire range of technical issues impacting our global customer base. You’ll provide expert-level troubleshooting, perform in-depth diagnostics, and guide customers through resolution for Litera’s suite of SaaS products. In our unified support model, engineers are empowered to handle issues of any severity or complexity, ensuring a seamless, customer-first experience. You will also contribute to product improvement initiatives, knowledge sharing, and mentorship within the team.

Analyze logs, gather technical data, and isolate root causes for performance or functional problems.
Execute support-led upgrades and conduct pre-upgrade validations as needed.
Develop and document actionable remediation plans (3Ws: Who, What, When) and Root Cause Analyses (RCAs).
Escalate cases requiring broader collaboration with SMEs or Development, providing complete technical context.


Knowledge & Content Contributions


Author, review, and publish knowledge base articles, FAQs, and product content to enable faster resolutions and reduce repetitive support inquiries.
Continuously search for and apply knowledge resources to resolve cases, while identifying and addressing documentation gaps.
Engage with Litera’s community platforms, answering complex or unresolved customer questions.


Cross-Functional Collaboration & Customer Advocacy


Collaborate with Product, Engineering, and Customer Success teams, sharing customer feedback, technical challenges, and patterns of recurring issues.

Operational Excellence


Manage your case queue with a focus on responsiveness, documentation quality, and resolution effectiveness.
Participate in rotating on-call, weekend, or holiday coverage to maintain Litera’s global support readiness.
Contribute to support operations initiatives aimed at improving process efficiency and customer experience.
Maintain active engagement in team communication channels to stay current with product updates, known issues, and cross-team discussions.


Mentorship & Enablement


Mentor and coach peers and new hires by sharing expertise, case strategies, and best practices.
Develop and deliver onboarding or targeted technical training sessions to elevate the skills of the support team.


Product Quality


Review and test new releases or hotfixes to identify regressions and file issues as needed (not formal QA).
Provide feedback on product usability and supportability to enhance future versions.


Qualifications & Skills


Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related technical field (or equivalent experience).
Minimum of 3-5 years in technical support roles with proven experience troubleshooting complex software issues end-to-end.
Deep technical knowledge in operating systems, virtualization, networking, and databases relevant to SaaS deployments.
Proven experience working with Microsoft Dynamics 365, with a strong understanding of its architecture, customization, and integration capabilities; certifications in Dynamics 365 (e.g. MB-910, MB-920, MB-230) are highly desirable.
Experience working with case management tools (e.g., Salesforce, Zendesk) and issue tracking systems (e.g., JIRA).
Advanced diagnostic, analytical, and problem-solving skills.
Excellent verbal and written communication, with the ability to explain technical details clearly to diverse audiences.
Strong organizational skills for managing multiple simultaneous cases with varying priorities.
Experience in scripting, SQL, or log analysis is an advantage.
