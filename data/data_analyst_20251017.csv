With over 38,000 homes in management across London and southern England, we provide a wide range of homes for social, affordable and private rent, specialist housing services, as well as homes for sale and shared ownership.

Our 70,000 customers have diverse backgrounds and levels of income and weâre here to provide all of them with homes that are safe, high quality and sustainable. And with social housing roots going back eight decades, we continue to ensure that every penny of profit we make is reinvested into our charitable social purpose â delivering more homes and better services for customers.

Weâre also members of the G15, a group of leading housing associations that work together to house one in ten Londoners and tackle the housing crisis.

Role Overview

We are looking for a People Data and Insight Analyst to join our dedicated People Services department. This role combines analytical expertise with business acumen to guide People strategy, enhance performance, and ensure compliance. The post holder will deliver reporting and insight that supports key People lifecycle events (e.g. performance, salary, and bonus reviews), fulfil cyclical reporting requirements such as Gender Pay Gap reporting, and contribute to data cleansing and migration activities as part of People Services transformation project.

Analyse People Services and workforce data to identify trends, risks, and opportunities that inform strategic and operational decisions
Produce dashboards, scorecards, and narrative reports that clearly communicate insights to non-technical People Services and senior stakeholders. Help People services and business leaders interpret data and embed insight into decision-making
Use advanced analytics techniques (e.g. predictive modelling, segmentation, regression) to provide forward-looking insight, not just descriptive reporting
Support cyclical processes (performance, reward, pay gap reporting) by producing reports and analysis to highlight key themes and implications.


Data Quality & Governance


Partner with the Data team and colleagues to ensure People data is accurate, consistent, and well-governed and ensure adherence to the hub and spoke framework to certify datasets
Work with the People Services Systems Manager to conduct UAT testing of People Services systems, process data, and support the People Services Systems team
Monitor data quality, identifying root causes of issues and recommending process improvements
Act as People Servicesâs data steward, ensuring GDPR compliance, robust governance, and high data quality by managing People data assets, maintaining integrity and security, and representing People services in data stewardship meetings


Innovation & Continuous Improvement


Develop and enhance the use of analytics tools (e.g. Power BI, SQL & Excel) to improve reporting and insight capability
Proactively seek opportunities to automate standard reporting and free capacity for deeper analysis
Stay up to date with external trends in People analytics, benchmarking, and regulatory reporting, bringing new ideas into People Services
Work closely with People Business Partners and senior managers to understand their needs, framing analysis that answers business questions
Educate stakeholders on how to use data effectively to improve decision-making and operational efficiency.


More About You

Excellent communication and storytelling skills, able to simplify complexity

Radius is a global business services company operating in 19 countries across five continents. Founded in 1990, weâve grown from a successful fuel card business in North West England into a trusted provider of fleet and connectivity solutions for businesses of all sizes.

Our mission is to help companies adapt to market changes and seize new opportunities through integrated, scalable services.

Job Description

We are seeking an experienced Data Analyst to join our central Data Services & Reporting (DS&R) team.

This role is ideal for a data professional with at least two years commercial experience using SQL and Tableau to deliver impactful insights across a diverse business.

Youâll collaborate with stakeholders across all eight divisions of Radius, helping to shape data-driven decisions and improve reporting processes.

While experience with Salesforce reporting is advantageous, it is not essential - we offer support and development in this area.

This is a fully office-based role, located at our Radius Campus HQ in Crewe, Cheshire.

Objectives


Deliver accurate, insightful reporting solutions through agile development and service desk support.
Promote adoption of automated, self-service reporting tools across the business.
Support the broader Radius Data Strategy through training, stakeholder engagement, and continuous improvement.
Work collaboratively to enhance team performance and drive innovation in reporting.


Key Responsibilities


Design and deliver reporting solutions using Tableau and SQL, aligned with business needs and team standards.
Engage directly with stakeholders to gather requirements, understand business processes, and manage small projects to support reporting delivery.
Support the Data Service Desk on a rota basis (2-4 hours per week), providing quick development fixes and guidance to business teams.
Collaborate with DS&R colleagues, IT, and Radius business units on larger, cross-functional data projects.
Contribute to team development, process improvement, and overall wellbeing within DS&R.


What Weâre Looking For


Minimum of two yearsâ commercial experience in a data analyst role.
Strong SQL skills and a commitment to further development in data analytics.
Proven experience with Tableau.
Ability to work with stakeholders to refine requirements and deliver actionable insights.
Analytical mindset with attention to detail and a curiosity for understanding business context.
Familiarity with Salesforce dashboards and reporting is a plus, but not required.


Additional Information

Your impact on Radius will be rewarded with the opportunity to develop and progress your career in many directions.

Youâll also have access to our competitive reward and benefits package, which includes:


Pension
Life assurance
Performance-related bonus scheme
Employee fuel card scheme
Electric Vehicle scheme
Employee assistance programme
Wellness and healthcare assistance via âHelp@Handâ by Unum

Allica is the UKâs fastest growing company - and the fastest-growing financial technology (Fintech) firm ever. Our purpose is to help established SMEs, one of the last major underserved opportunities in Fintech.




Established SMEs are the backbone of local communities - representing over a third of our economy - yet have been largely neglected both by traditional high street banks and modern fintech providers.




Department Description

Our vision is to reimagine Relationship Banking for established SMEs, through the very best people, products and digital tools. We donât pretend to have all the answers yet, and you will play a role in continuing to shape our offering.




Our Relationship Manager team was formed in 2022 and continues to grow with the Bank at pace. Providing every customer who opens an account with us with a Relationship Manager, to work alongside them and provide outstanding service, is core to our strategy.

In addition to providing outstanding service, our Relationship Managers build deep levels of understanding and trust with their customers, and get to understand their ambitions, goals and motivations. Allica Relationship Managers support their customers through the provision of appropriate Allica Bank products including Business Current Accounts, Savings Accounts, Commercial Loans, Asset Finance and Working Capital Facilities.




All Relationship Manager roles at Allica Bank carry a requirement for new business acquisition as we continue to build the bank. Where portfolios are held, they are built to allow capacity to do this. Relationship Managers will bring, and continue to build, a strong network of trusted SME advisors such as accountants, solicitors, business organisations and others (but not commercial finance brokers â these are looked after by our dedicated broker team). We expect our Relationship Managers to be recognised as valued partners and experts in business finance by their clients and in the communities they serve.




Principal Accountabilities

Relationship Manage a portfolio of SME customers, understanding customerâs needs and business aspirations, and looking for opportunities to support them via Allica Bank services and through their own external networks
Originating SME lending opportunities for both existing and new customers from initial enquiry through to completion, including writing credit papers in line with Allicaâs credit policy and appetite.
Delivering the business plan for your local area, and actively managing your objectives and personal development plan.
Making your colleagues proud that you represent Allica in your local area, by ensuring excellent service for local SME customers, prospects and advisors.
Working closely and collaboratively with all areas of Allica to ensure a seamless and professional service is always provided.
Being a positive contributor to Allicaâs culture, and always demonstrating the bankâs values
Complying with all mandatory policies, and adherence to operational procedures to maintain internal controls.




Personal Attributes & Experience

Highly capable Relationship Manager and Business Developer with a long-term track record of building high-value, trust based and long-lasting referral relationships.
You will need to have a strong understanding of SME banking, which must include a background in commercial lending.
You will be able to demonstrate a history of exemplary level of service, and of maximising the value with prospects and customers.
You will be able to demonstrate a passion for SMEs, be a self-starter and bring an entrepreneurial mindset to your work.
You will have excellent interpersonal and communication skills together with evidence of strong career progression and/or outperformance.
Youâll be able to evidence an ability to work expertly with customers, colleagues and advisors to structure new lending proposals and write credit applications.
Youâll have a proven track record in providing excellent customer service, and in generating new income opportunities whilst effectively managing credit risk.
Youâll demonstrate an ability to analyse and review financial accounts and associated information.

          <p><strong>About Allica Bank</strong></p><p>Allica is the UKâs fastest growing company - and the fastest-growing financial technology (Fintech) firm ever. Our purpose is to help established SMEs, one of the last major underserved opportunities in Fintech.</p><p><br></p><p>Established SMEs are the backbone of local communities - representing over a third of our economy - yet have been largely neglected both by traditional high street banks and modern fintech providers.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Department Description</strong></p><p>Our vision is to reimagine Relationship Banking for established SMEs, through the very best people, products and digital tools. We donât pretend to have all the answers yet, and you will play a role in continuing to shape our offering.</p><p><br></p><p>Our Relationship Manager team was formed in 2022 and continues to grow with the Bank at pace. Providing every customer who opens an account with us with a Relationship Manager, to work alongside them and provide outstanding service, is core to our strategy.</p><p>In addition to providing outstanding service, our Relationship Managers build deep levels of understanding and trust with their customers, and get to understand their ambitions, goals and motivations. Allica Relationship Managers support their customers through the provision of appropriate Allica Bank products including Business Current Accounts, Savings Accounts, Commercial Loans, Asset Finance and Working Capital Facilities.</p><p><br></p><p>All Relationship Manager roles at Allica Bank carry a requirement for new business acquisition as we continue to build the bank. Where portfolios are held, they are built to allow capacity to do this. Relationship Managers will bring, and continue to build, a strong network of trusted SME advisors such as accountants, solicitors, business organisations and others (but not commercial finance brokers â these are looked after by our dedicated broker team). We expect our Relationship Managers to be recognised as valued partners and experts in business finance by their clients and in the communities they serve.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Principal Accountabilities</strong></p><ul><li>Relationship Manage a portfolio of SME customers, understanding customerâs needs and business aspirations, and looking for opportunities to support them via Allica Bank services and through their own external networks</li><li>Originating SME lending opportunities for both existing and new customers from initial enquiry through to completion, including writing credit papers in line with Allicaâs credit policy and appetite.</li><li>Delivering the business plan for your local area, and actively managing your objectives and personal development plan.</li><li>Making your colleagues proud that you represent Allica in your local area, by ensuring excellent service for local SME customers, prospects and advisors.</li><li>Working closely and collaboratively with all areas of Allica to ensure a seamless and professional service is always provided.</li><li>Being a positive contributor to Allicaâs culture, and always demonstrating the bankâs values</li><li>Complying with all mandatory policies, and adherence to operational procedures to maintain internal controls.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Personal Attributes &amp; Experience</strong></p><ul><li>Highly capable Relationship Manager and Business Developer with a long-term track record of building high-value, trust based and long-lasting referral relationships.</li><li>You will need to have a strong understanding of SME banking, which must include a background in commercial lending.</li><li>You will be able to demonstrate a history of exemplary level of service, and of maximising the value with prospects and customers.</li><li>You will be able to demonstrate a passion for SMEs, be a self-starter and bring an entrepreneurial mindset to your work.</li><li>You will have excellent interpersonal and communication skills together with evidence of strong career progression and/or outperformance.</li><li>Youâll be able to evidence an ability to work expertly with customers, colleagues and advisors to structure new lending proposals and write credit applications.</li><li>Youâll have a proven track record in providing excellent customer service, and in generating new income opportunities whilst effectively managing credit risk.</li><li>Youâll demonstrate an ability to analyse and review financial accounts and associated information.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Working at Allica Bank</strong></p><p>At Allica Bank we want to ensure our employees have the right tools and environment in which to succeed in their role and in support of our customers.</p><p>Our employees are at the heart of everything we do, so our benefits are designed with you in mind:</p><ul><li>Full onboarding support and continued development opportunities</li><li>Options for flexible working</li><li>Regular social activities</li><li>Pension contributions</li><li>Discretionary bonus scheme</li><li>Private health cover</li><li>Life assurance</li><li>Family friendly policies including enhanced Maternity &amp; Paternity leave</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Donât tick every box?</strong></p><p>Donât worry if you donât have all the skills or requirements listed on the job description.

Strategy Analyst Graduate - Nottingham

Salary: Â£50,000 plus a Â£5,000 joining bonus and other benefits

Location: Nottingham only

Start date: 14th September 2026

Eligibility: Open to any final year students graduating in 2026, or those who have graduated in 2025. (This includes undergraduates, masters and PhD students)

Sponsorship: Weâre able to sponsor if you currently have the right to work in the UK (including student/graduate visas)

Closing date: 3rd November 2025 (subject to close early)

As we recruit on a rolling basis, we recommend applying as soon as you can

Developing the strategy behind our success. That's one good thing.

At Capital One, we're on a mission: to change credit â one good thing at a time. You might think of us as a credit card company. But the truth is, we're just as much a technology business. And we're here to make a positive difference â to our customers, our colleagues and community.

Our Strategy Teams Are Fundamental In How We Drive The Business Forward, But Most Importantly, How We Solve Problems And Work With Our Customers. As a Strategy Analyst You Could Be


Finding innovative ways to attract new customers and ensure our products meet their needs.
Providing support and tools to help our customers manage their finances and protect them from fraud.
Creating marketing strategies that get the right messages across in the right places.
Striking the right balance in the lending we do and the risk to the business.


Key to all this work is insightful data analysis and critical judgement skills. You will be trained and developed on coding and analytical tools - enabling you to really dig deep into the datasets.

Because of this exciting range of work, rotations are a core part of the role. In return, this allows you to develop your skills and knowledge across a range of projects and business areas, supporting you in becoming a well rounded Strategy Analyst.

One of the happy consequences of making finance easier for our customers is that Capital One is an inspiring place to launch your career. Join us, and youâll have a manager, mentor and buddy for support as you take on meaningful work in collaborative teams. Weâve got a great track record of hiring graduates and enabling them to reach their full potential. Just look at our former CEO, Lucy Hagues. She started as a graduate, led the UK business, and is now an Executive Vice President for Capital One Enterprise! And thatâs just one of many success stories.

What Youâll Need

We donât mind what degree background or grades you have, but we want to see:


Your ability to identify solutions or opportunities using data and sound reasoning.
A strong aptitude for maths, and that you can apply problem solving and creative thinking to come up with suitable recommendations.
How you use your judgement within decision making.
You have strong written and verbal communication skills.
You arenât afraid to share your ideas and you thrive in a collaborative environment.
You have a curiosity to learn and take ownership of your development.
Whilst also being focused on growth and development â yours and ours.


The Recruitment Process

Step 1: Apply! We donât screen CVâs so thereâs no need to tailor your CV or attach a cover letter. After your initial application, if you meet the eligibility criteria you will be sent out online testing to complete, which assess the core skills required for the role.

Step 2: Next up, you will be invited to complete a one way video interview

Step 3: Youâll get to (virtually) meet with one of our Strategy Analysts to complete a case study interview

Step 4: The in person assessment day, which consists of a group activity, case study and individual interview. A great chance for you to have a look around our office and see the working environment!

Whatâs in it for you?


Outstanding learning and career development through our Capital One Develop UK training programmes (and appropriate external providers)
Core benefits including a pension scheme, bonus, generous holidays, private medical insurance. Flexible benefits including season-ticket loans and cycle to work scheme
Open-plan workspaces and accessible facilities designed to support and inspire you, including a fully serviced gym, subsidised restaurant, mindfulness and games rooms
Plenty of volunteering opportunities to give back to the community through our community impact and investment programmes
Regular social events run by our GradComm team, as well as an annual company-wide summer festival and christmas party
You can even help to shape how our early careers programmes look for future graduates by joining one of our working groups or becoming a buddy/mentor yourself


Where And How You'll Work

This is a permanent position based at our Nottingham office.

We have a hybrid working model which gives you flexibility to work from our offices and from home. Weâre big on collaboration and connection, so youâll be based in our Nottingham office 3 days a week on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.

We want to work with top talent: whoever you are, whatever you look like, wherever you come from. We know itâs about what you do, not just what you say. Thatâs why we make our recruitment process fair and accessible.

We are committed to creating teams that are representative of our customers and the communities we serve. We welcome applications from everyone, and would particularly love to hear from you if you identify with an under-represented group in our industry, such as women, the LGBTQ+ community and ethnic minority candidates.

Provide analytical support for Tech, Product and analyst teams.
Develop complex procedures and scripts in SQL and Python within the team to drive improvements to data quality processes.
Support analytical teams in solving complex technical and analytical problems.
Develop a deep understanding of how data is used in Capital one, and the supporting ecosystem.



What are we looking for:


Excellent communication skills, including the ability to explain complex situations in appropriate language for others to understand .
Technical Excellence - Advanced SQL skills required, with proficiency in at least one additional programming language (e.g. Python, R) preferred.
Expertise in Data Analytics - Advanced proficiency in core data analyst skills, including coding, data transformation, comprehensive data knowledge, and a strong understanding of systems.
Initiative & Ownership - Strong ability to prioritize workloads, deliver results at pace, and escalate issues effectively when required.
Problem-Solving skills - A structured, inquisitive approach to solving challenges and delivering creative solutions.

Job Title: Research Assistant

School of Medicine

Fixed-term post

Applications are invited for a motivated Research Assistant to join the School of Medicine and support an exciting study led by Dr Natalie Shur âInvestigating Mechanisms of Knee Pain Improvement in Individuals with Obesity Undergoing Weight Loss: A Pilot Study on Radiological, Metabolic, and Intra-Articular Microenvironment Changeâ.

This project, funded by the BMA Foundation, Doris Hillier Grant, aims to investigate the mechanisms by which weight loss improves knee pain in individuals with obesity recently prescribed glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. The study will investigate changes in knee pain and function longitudinally in patients undergoing weight loss, as well as knee cartilage thickness and strain using MRI, inflammatory biomarkers, and the synovial fluid microenvironment in a subgroup of individuals. It will utilise advanced imaging techniques, metabolic assessment, and proteomic analysis. By studying both biomechanical and metabolic processes, this research will provide new insights into the mechanisms driving pain relief and may inform future non-surgical treatment strategies for knee osteoarthritis.

About The Role

The Research Assistant will play a central role in:


Longitudinal data collection via online survey
Recruiting participants and running study visits including acquisition of imaging and assistance with biological sample collection.
Managing data with accuracy and integrity.
Contributing to advanced imaging analysis (MRI, MR Spectroscopy, musculoskeletal ultrasound).
Supporting data analysis, manuscript preparation, and presentation of findings.


You will be working in a multidisciplinary environment with musculoskeletal clinicians and scientists based in the Academic Unit of Injury, Recovery and Inflammation Sciences (IRIS) and physicists working in the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre. The post will be of particular interest to people wishing to develop their experience in translational musculoskeletal research.

The role is offered on a part time basis over 18 months at 0.5FTE, however we will accept a higher FTE. Please specify your preferred hours in your application. This post is offered on a fixed term basis.

About You

We are looking for a candidate who is:


Highly organised with excellent attention to detail.
Able to work effectively with human research participants.
Interested in musculoskeletal health, obesity, imaging, and metabolic science.
Keen to contribute to high-impact research with real clinical relevance.


You must have a BSc or equivalent experience in a relevant health related discipline (physiotherapy, sport and exercise science, clinical sciences, anatomy) and be experienced in a variety of quantitative research methodologies involving human participants. Additional desirable criteria include an MSc in a related subject e.g. Sport and Exercise Medicine or working towards PhD in relevant subject area.

Interviews will take place on Wednesday, 5th November.

If you have any questions about this role, please contact Dr Natalie Shur (natalie.shur@nottingham.ac.uk). Please note that applications sent directly to this email address will not be accepted.
