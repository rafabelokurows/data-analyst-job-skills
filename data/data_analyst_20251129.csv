Since 2017, CoreWeave has operated a growing footprint of data centers covering every region of the US and across Europe, and was ranked as one of the TIME100 most influential companies of 2024. By bringing together CoreWeave’s industry-leading cloud infrastructure with the best-in-class tools AI practitioners know and love from Weights & Biases, we’re setting a new standard for how AI is built, trained, and scaled.

The integration of our teams and technologies is accelerating our shared mission: to empower developers with the tools and infrastructure they need to push the boundaries of what AI can do. From experiment tracking and model optimization to high-performance training clusters, agent building, and inference at scale, we’re combining forces to serve the full AI lifecycle — all in one seamless platform.

Weights & Biases has long been trusted by over 1,500 organizations — including AstraZeneca, Canva, Cohere, OpenAI, Meta, Snowflake, Square,Toyota, and Wayve — to build better models, AI agents and applications. Now, as part of CoreWeave, that impact is amplified across a broader ecosystem of AI innovators, researchers, and enterprises.

As we unite under one vision, we’re looking for bold thinkers and agile builders who are excited to shape the future of AI alongside us. If you're passionate about solving complex problems at the intersection of software, hardware, and AI, there's never been a more exciting time to join our team.

What We Do

The Data group at Weights & Biases works across the full range of data-related topics:


We help business partners set goals, make decisions, and understand the levers to achieve their goals.
We build reporting to keep the business attuned and aligned.
We build datasets and pipelines to support self-service analysis.
We train models to understand our customer growth, churn risk, and detect spam and abuse.
We’re exploring novel benchmarks and recs for model training.
We build and maintain a massive data platform to power it all.


About The Role

As a Senior Data Analyst (for Product), you’ll be embedded with product teams to help them understand what’s working, what’s not, and where to focus next. You’ll dig into usage data, run experiments, and build reporting that helps PMs and engineers see how customers are engaging with W&B. Your analyses will directly shape product direction.

Who You Are

You’re someone who loves exploring user behavior and finding patterns in messy product data. You enjoy collaborating with PMs and engineers, and you’re motivated by influencing product decisions with data. You’re equally comfortable writing SQL, running an A/B test, or explaining your findings in plain English.


Strong SQL and python skills; experience with large, event-driven datasets.
Strong working familiarity with analytical and statistical techniques for analysis, testing, and identifying casual relationships.
Familiarity with common analytics concepts (funnels, retention, cohort analysis, experiment design).
Ability to partner with PMs and engineers, and turn questions into structured analysis.
History of writing easy-to-follow code and effective documentation for your projects
Experience with dbt, Hex, and experimentation platforms is a plus..


Preferred


Autonomous: If you work well in a self-directed environment, and proactively find ways to improve processes and collaborate with team members or engaged users, your initiative will really shine in this role.
Outgoing and friendly: You'll love this role if you enjoy connecting with real users day to day, helping them solve issues and understand good patterns for using our tools. Day to day you'll be answering questions and requests with a kind, thoughtful tone that makes users feel appreciated and connected to our team.

Rivian is on a mission to keep the world adventurous forever. This goes for the emissions-free Electric Adventure Vehicles we build, and the curious, courageous souls we seek to attract.

As a company, we constantly challenge what’s possible, never simply accepting what has always been done. We reframe old problems, seek new solutions and operate comfortably in areas that are unknown. Our backgrounds are diverse, but our team shares a love of the outdoors and a desire to protect it for future generations.

Role Summary

The Facilities Technology team drives Rivian’s mission by empowering the Facilities organization with the data, tools, and systems needed to plan, build, and operate our manufacturing, commercial, and workplace capital projects. We build and manage analytics and systems that enable Rivian to move faster, make smarter decisions, and deliver world-class facilities that power our growth.

We’re seeking an experienced Business Intelligence Analyst based in the Greater Atlanta Area to turn complex construction and manufacturing data into clear reporting and meaningful insights that drive better, faster decisions.

This role supports Rivian’s production manufacturing facility build-out -a large program of high-complexity industrial projects requiring tight coordination across engineering, construction, and operations teams. You’ll create dashboards, reports, and models that monitor and forecast cost, schedule, and performance, unifying scattered data into trusted sources of truth.

Working in a notebook-based environment (Hex.tech), you’ll use Python, Pandas, and SQL to clean, analyze, visualize, and automate data pipelines. You’ll integrate data from systems like Autodesk Construction Cloud, Procore, Kahua, and other proprietary tools, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to translate business needs into actionable intelligence for large-scale manufacturing projects.

Responsibilities


Design, develop, and maintain robust, scalable, and interactive dashboards and reports using our primary BI tool, Hex, or similar BI tools.
Utilize Python (including libraries like Pandas, NumPy) within our notebook-based environment, Hex, for advanced data analysis, manipulation, cleaning, and scripting.
Collaborate with business stakeholders across various teams to gather requirements, understand key performance indicators (KPIs), and deliver BI solutions that meet their needs.
Connect to, query, and integrate data from the Data Warehouse and multiple systems, including key construction management platforms (e.g., Autodesk Construction Cloud, Procore, Kahua), ERPs, and internal data warehouses such as Databricks.
Develop a deep understanding of facilities data schemas to effectively model and analyze metrics related to cost, schedule, quality, safety, and asset lifecycle.
Conduct ad-hoc data analysis and present findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
Contribute to data governance and process standardization, ensuring data accuracy, integrity, and traceability across systems.
Support and train end-users to effectively use BI tools and reports for self-service analytics.


Qualifications


3-5+ years of proven experience in a Business Intelligence, Data Analyst, or similar role.
Strong proficiency in Python for data analysis and manipulation, with specific experience in a notebook-based environment (e.g., Jupyter, Hex, or similar).
Hands-on experience with data visualization and BI tools such as Tableau, Power BI, Looker, or equivalent platforms.
Proficient in SQL for data extraction, transformation, and complex queries.
Excellent analytical, problem-solving, and critical-thinking skills.
Strong communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with stakeholders at all levels.
Bachelor's degree in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, or a related quantitative field.
Preferred:
Direct, hands-on experience with the data models, APIs, and reporting/analytics modules of construction management platforms (e.g., Autodesk Construction Cloud, Procore, Kahua, or similar).
Deep domain knowledge of large capital programs, infrastructure projects, or large-scale construction, particularly from an owner's, operator's, or developer's perspective.
Direct experience with the Hex data analytics platform.
Understanding of data warehousing concepts and ETL processes.
