Key Responsibilities

Support the re-platforming of the data environment onto Microsoft Fabric, laying the foundations for ERP-ready data and future analytics.
Lead deep-dive discovery for reporting and analytics, mapping current (“as-is”) reports and data flows and defining future (“to-be”) requirements.
Act as the primary bridge between business stakeholders, internal IT/development teams and an external implementation partner.
Translate commercial and operational reporting needs into clear, structured and testable requirements.
Trace and reconcile data from source systems through to reports, validating accuracy and consistency.
Maintain strong analysis governance, including requirements logs, data dictionaries, reporting inventories and documentation.
Collaborate with finance, merchandising, insights/CRM, operations and IT stakeholders to shape reporting and data solutions.
Support the design of robust data structures and reporting layers within Microsoft Fabric.
Communicate progress, risks and issues clearly to senior stakeholders and end users.




About the Environment

Fast-paced retail/consumer environment where stock, trading performance and customer insight are critical.
Opportunity to shape a greenfield data platform.
High visibility and direct engagement with senior stakeholders.
Initial 3-month contract focused on discovery, with scope to extend into migration, ERP-ready data and longer-term initiatives on a permanent basis.




Skills & Experience

Proven experience as a Data Business Analyst working across data platforms, reporting and analytics.
Strong background in data-led transformation projects, particularly discovery and requirements definition.
Ability to work across current-state and future-state reporting, data flows and source-to-report analysis.
Excellent stakeholder management and communication skills across business, IT and third-party partners.
Organised, detail-driven and comfortable managing multiple priorities.
Hands-on mindset with the ability to balance strategic thinking and detailed data analysis.
Experience with modern data platforms (Microsoft Fabric advantageous but not essential).
Comfortable working hybrid, with regular on-site presence in Stevenage.
