Marketing Intelligence – instantly answers questions like “What led to that sudden drop in pipeline?”
Account Intelligence – surfaces next-best actions to help reps move target accounts toward conversion


Since launching in January 2023, we’ve come through Y Combinator, raised a $26M Series A led by Bessemer. We’re growing 3× year-over-year, have hit multimillion ARR, and process over 60 TB of GTM data monthly. Based at our San Francisco HQ, we operate fully in-person, move fast and hire people who are ready to win.

🚀 Your Mission

We are seeking a customer-focused Data Analyst to help our clients answer their most important business questions around GTM revenue performance and marketing spend optimization. This is not a heavy data-engineering role; instead, you’ll use HockeyStack’s platform and available data to guide customers toward impactful insights and recommendations.

🔧 What You’ll Do


Partner with customers to solve their revenue goals, challenges, and questions. Use HockeyStack’s platform to uncover insights and deliver clear, actionable recommendations.
Translate complex metrics into straightforward explanations for non-technical audiences.
Be the Data Partner to support Customer Success Managers in delivering strategic guidance to clients.
Identify patterns and trends in marketing and sales data to advise customers on where to focus efforts.
Collaborate with internal teams to continuously enhance the customer experience.


🧩 Core Strengths


Business Insight: Ability to connect data to revenue outcomes and business strategy.
Customer Orientation: Skilled at understanding client goals and delivering value through insights.
Analytical Thinking: Comfortable framing and answering complex questions with data-driven logic.
Clear Communication: Able to translate analytics into simple, impactful recommendations.


🧬 What We’re Looking For


Ownership-first mindset — you take initiative, move fast, and figure things out
Thrive in early-stage, high-urgency environments where speed and impact matter
Curious, self-aware, and feedback-driven — you bring energy, not ego
See this role as a defining chapter — not a stepping stone or side quest
Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Data Science, Applied Economics, or a related field.
1–3 years of experience in Data Analytics or Consulting with Analytical focus. Strong preference for candidates with Marketing Analytics or GTM/Sales Analytics Experience.
Strong problem-solving skills with the ability to structure and answer key business questions.
Excellent communication skills to convey data-driven insights to senior stakeholders.
Familiarity with SaaS, B2B marketing, or revenue analytics is a strong plus.
Ability to think strategically and recommend actions based on data, without needing to deep-dive into raw datasets.


✨ Why Join Now?

We’re at an inflection point. The product is proven, the market is massive, and the opportunity is wide open. You’ll be joining a company with real traction, rapid growth, and meaningful backing—where every person still shapes the outcome. This isn’t just a job. It’s a chance to build something category-defining with people who care deeply about doing it right.

We’re building a high-performing, in-person culture at our San Francisco HQ, where the team collaborates shoulder-to-shoulder five days a week. The base salary range for this role is $80,000 to $120,000 USD, adjusted for location, experience, and qualifications.

HockeyStack is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, protected veteran status, disability, or any other legally protected status. We celebrate diversity and are committed to fostering an inclusive environment for all employees.

JOB DESCRIPTION

The Trading Analyst III will be a key contributor to the performance and strategy of the Trading Department. This role requires a strong analytical mindset, domain knowledge of sports betting, and the ability to work autonomously on complex, high impact problem statements. You’ll be expected to deliver high quality, data driven insights and solutions that improve pricing accuracy, enhance risk management, boost operational efficiency, and deepen understanding of underlying performance.

The successful applicant will be naturally curious, constantly digging beneath the surface to uncover the ""why"" behind trends, while clearly articulating the impact of variance and volatility on outcomes. They will have the confidence to challenge constructively in order to ensure incorrect assumptions are corrected. They will collaborate with stakeholders to clarify needs and ensure problem statements are fully understood, delivering the right solutions, not just ticking off requirements. A strong sense of ownership, the ability to navigate ambiguity, and a collaborative mindset will be key to success.

Responsibilities


Lead complex analytical projects that support pricing, margin optimization, and risk management decisions.
Build, manage, and maintain reports and dashboards that promote self-service, consistency, and accuracy.
Develop and maintain robust data models that enable scalable, detailed, and reusable analysis.
Cultivate strong cross-functional relationships with Product, Finance, Commercial, and Data teams.
Identify performance issues and opportunities, and drive improvements independently and in collaboration with relevant stakeholders.
Translate analytical findings into clear, compelling narratives for both technical and non-technical audiences.
Mentor junior analysts and support broader Trading team efforts to enhance data literacy.
Contribute to continuous improvement of internal processes, tooling, and team workflows.
Help shape and communicate the narrative around Trading performance.


Experience And Skills


3–5 years of experience in a trading, analytics, or quantitative role, ideally within the betting and gaming industry or a comparably fast paced, data rich environment.
Strong SQL skills are essential; experience with Python, R, or similar tools is a plus.
Hands on experience building and maintaining data models in tools like DBT, Databricks, or other modern data stack components.
Deep understanding of trading fundamentals, including pricing, margin, and risk models.
Proven ability to independently solve complex problems, applying sound analytical approaches aligned with business goals.
Experience balancing and delivering against multiple priorities in high-pressure environments.
Excellent communication skills, with a track record of influencing decisions through insight and data storytelling.
Collaborative and proactive team player with a growth mindset and high standards for quality.
Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Engineering, or Computer Science.

Our studio serves as a centralized partner for a wide range of business-critical areas—spanning Global Brand and Brand Partnerships, Ads, Consumer Products, and live experiences like Netflix House.

As Netflix continues to expand into new business units, formats, and physical experiences, the volume and complexity of design output across the company continues to grow.

Cross-Functional Creative Support


Collaborate with partners across Brand, Product Marketing, Consumer Products, Netflix House, and Corporate Comms to support a wide range of creative needs.
Contribute to presentation design for executive, sales, and high-priority communications where clarity and brand expression are critical.
Ensure work is fit-for-purpose across audiences and channels while adhering to Netflix brand standards.


Systems & Workflow Contribution


Support the ongoing development and refinement of templates, modular systems, and production workflows.
Adapt existing systems to new formats, channels, and use cases as needed.
Work efficiently within fast-moving timelines while maintaining a high standard of craft.


Craft, Quality & Growth


Uphold quality and attention to detail across all production outputs.
Incorporate feedback thoughtfully and iterate quickly.
Stay current on best practices in production design, brand systems, and design tooling.


Qualifications


4–6 years of experience in design within a creative agency, design studio, or in-house brand team.
Strong foundation in visual design, including typography, layout, hierarchy, and composition.
Experience working within established brand systems and templates.
Ability to execute high-volume design work efficiently without sacrificing quality.
Exposure to a range of outputs, such as marketing assets, toolkits, sales materials, and presentation design.
Strong collaboration skills and comfort working with cross-functional partners.
Fluency in modern design tools and workflows (Figma, Adobe Creative Suite; motion experience a plus).
Clear communicator who is receptive to feedback and eager to learn.
Highly organized and comfortable working in fast-paced environments.
Interest in growing within a production design or systems-led design practice.

Fully Remote | Full-Time

Base Salary: $120,000 – $170,000




Partnering with a Leading P&C Insurance Carrier

James Search Group is proud to partner with a highly rated Property & Casualty insurance carrier that is making significant investments in data engineering, analytics, and machine learning. The company is building a centralized Data & ML/AI organization that unites experts across data architecture, engineering, analytics, governance, and modeling—creating a unique opportunity for growth, collaboration, and innovation.




We are seeking a Senior Data Engineer to design, build, and maintain the upstream components of a modern data platform. From ingestion and real-time streaming to data quality frameworks, you’ll play a pivotal role in shaping the technical foundation of the company’s next-generation data environment. This is a hands-on role where you’ll be coding daily, mentoring peers, and collaborating closely with analytics engineers, data scientists, and business partners.




Office Locations (Optional Hybrid):

This is a remote-first position, but you can also work from one of the carrier’s multiple U.S. office locations.




What You’ll Do:

Design, build, and optimize scalable data pipelines for batch and real-time processing.
Implement data ingestion frameworks including CDC from core systems, APIs, and third-party platforms (Salesforce, Workday, Duck Creek, etc.).
Develop and optimize Apache Spark jobs on Databricks, leveraging Delta Lake, DLT pipelines, and lakehouse architectures.
Ensure data quality, lineage, and governance using Unity Catalog, CI/CD, and role-based access/security controls.
Partner with analytics engineers (dbt) to deliver clean, structured upstream data.
Mentor peers, contribute to architecture decisions, and foster a culture of craftsmanship.
Leverage AWS services (S3, Glue, Lambda, etc.) and DevOps tools (GitHub, CI/CD) for scalable, production-grade deployments.




What You Bring:

3-5+ years of professional experience in data engineering, ideally within insurance or financial services.
Strong proficiency in Python, SQL, and Spark for building and optimizing pipelines.
Hands-on expertise with Databricks (Unity Catalog, Delta Lake, DLT pipelines) and/or Azure Data Services.
Strong knowledge of AWS data services, with the ability to adapt across cloud platforms (Azure, GCP).
Familiarity with modern data architectures (medallion, lakehouse, streaming).
Experience with GitHub, CI/CD pipelines, and testing frameworks.
A problem-solving mindset: balancing pragmatism with scalability, and a passion for working in collaborative teams.




What’s In It for You:

Competitive base salary ($120K–$170K)
Performance-based bonus
Comprehensive benefits package
401(k) with company match
Generous PTO and wellness programs




This is a rare opportunity to join a ground-floor data transformation at a forward-thinking P&C insurer, working with the latest tools and approaches to build something lasting.




If you’re excited to design and deliver production-grade data systems that directly empower analytics, AI, and business outcomes—we’d love to connect.
