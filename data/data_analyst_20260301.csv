PHSA is committed to anti-racism and equity in our hiring and employment practices. With learning and compassion, we are addressing existing inequities and barriers throughout our systems. PHSA is seeking to create a diverse workforce and to establish an inclusive and culturally safe environment. We invite applications and enquiries from all people, particularly those belonging to the historically, systemically, and/or persistently excluded groups identified under the B.C. Human Rights Code.

One of PHSA’s North Star priorities is to eradicate Indigenous-specific racism, which includes ongoing commitments to Indigenous recruitment and employee experience as well as dismantling barriers to health care employment at every level. We welcome Indigenous individuals to apply and/or contact the Sanya’k̓ula Team (Indigenous Recruitment & Employee Experience) for support at indigenous.employment@phsa.ca.

Indigenous-specific anti-racism initiatives are rooted in addressing the unique forms of discrimination, historical and ongoing injustices, and exclusion faced by Indigenous peoples. These initiatives align with an Indigenous rights-based approach, recognizing the inherent rights and title of BC First Nations and self-determination of all First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities. PHSA is mandated to uphold legislative obligations and provincial commitments found in the foundational documents including the Truth & Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action (2015), In Plain Sight (2020), BC's Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (2019), United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), Reclaiming Power and Place Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women & Girls Calls for Justice (2019), the Declaration Act Action Plan and Remembering Keegan: A First Nations Case Study.

Jetson is on a mission to accelerate the transition of 100 million homes across North America away from fossil fuels toward sustainable energy use. We believe in a future that is 100% electric and 100% better.

Homes are one of the largest sources of carbon emissions, yet adoption of solutions like heat pumps remains slow due to cost and complexity. Jetson is solving this by building the first fully vertically integrated home electrification company — making clean energy simple, transparent, and affordable.

We rely heavily on technology, automation, and data to scale this impact. At Jetson, we value people who are excellent at their craft, curious about new tools (including AI), and motivated to continuously improve how work gets done.

Job Overview

We are looking for an AI-native Data & Business Intelligence Lead to build Jetson’s internal data foundation and reporting systems from the ground up. This role will own the end-to-end analytics stack that powers decision-making across the organization — connecting systems like HubSpot, NetSuite, and field service software into a centralized AWS-based data lake and warehouse, implementing a modern BI layer, and delivering real-time operational visibility down to individual employee scorecards.

As one of the first hires focused specifically on internal data systems, you will play a key role in shaping how Jetson measures performance, drives accountability, and operates day-to-day. You will work closely with the founding team and business leaders, but will often be expected to make progress independently with limited structure or precedent. You will move quickly, prioritize leverage, and build systems that enable the entire company to run more effectively.

Most importantly, you will focus on delivering operational clarity and trustworthy metrics that help Jetson scale

Responsibilities


Own the design and implementation of Jetson’s centralized data platform, integrating core systems including HubSpot, NetSuite ERP, and field service management tools
Build and maintain reliable ingestion pipelines using tools like Fivetran (or similar), landing data into an AWS-based lake and warehouse
Develop and manage Jetson’s data infrastructure on AWS S3 and Amazon Redshift, ensuring clean schemas, strong governance, and high data quality
Implement a powerful BI layer (Looker, Metabase, Power BI, etc.) to support company-wide reporting and decision-making
Build dashboards and KPI reporting across Sales, Operations, Finance, Customer Success, and Leadership
Develop employee-level performance scorecards and operational accountability systems
Work toward real-time or near-real-time operational visibility across the business, replacing manual reporting and spreadsheet-driven processes
Always be looking for leverage: use modern AI tools to accelerate development, automate workflows, and generate operational insights
Identify gaps in how data is recorded throughout the company and improve instrumentation at the source
Collaborate closely with stakeholders across the organization to ensure reporting is trusted, actionable, and aligned on shared definition


Requirements


5+ years of experience in analytics engineering, business intelligence, data engineering, or a similar technical role
Strong experience building end-to-end internal analytics stacks (data ingestion → warehouse → BI)
Advanced proficiency in SQL and analytics data modeling
Hands-on experience with AWS data infrastructure, including S3 and Redshift
Familiarity with ELT tools like Fivetran, Airbyte, or similar platforms
Experience building dashboards, KPI frameworks, and operational reporting systems that drive accountability
Comfortable owning technical implementation independently without relying heavily on software engineering resources
Strong business intuition and ability to understand what metrics actually matter
Excellent written and verbal communication skill


Nice To Have


Experience working with RevOps systems, CRM/ERP integrations, or high-growth operational businesses
Familiarity with dbt or modern transformation frameworks
Experience building incentive or scorecard systems for frontline teams
Background in field service workflows or operational analytics

Pearl West is building the future of consumer brands—fast, focused, and performance-driven. Think mini-Unilever without the bloat of traditional private equity or the stale DTC playbook.
