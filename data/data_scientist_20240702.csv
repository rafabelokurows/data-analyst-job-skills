With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""which piece of Python code is better?"" to ""make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterwards to make it faster""

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Ready to ? Who you are:


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

At Arthur, we are deeply passionate about building technology to make AI understandable, effective, and fair. Arthur makes machine learning work for enterprises through performance monitoring, explainability, and bias detection. We believe strongly in front-end ethics: building a company and industry where strong performance and a positive human impact are inextricably linked. This position is a rare (and fun!) opportunity to help shape the future of AI and its real-world impact.

About The Role

Arthur is looking for a product-focused Machine Learning Engineer to join our team, to operate with autonomy and with the support of the team to lead and build out our product vision and deliver value to our customers.

What You'll Do


Focus on ML, especially LLMs, model performance, security, and robustness: make LLMs and model-based systems respond accurately, quickly, and comprehensively to general and task-specific interactions by both natural and adversarial users - for example, checking veracity of responses, hardening against prompt injection, query-based routing to different models, and generation of evaluation datasets
Build out new techniques and tooling in ML model monitoring: data drift detection, high-dimensional density estimation, time series anomaly detection; detection and mitigation of issues in fairness and bias in ML algorithms
Run machine learning experiments independently and in collaboration with product teams, and communicate results to internal stakeholders as well as the broader ML community via publications in top-tier conferences, industry conference presentations, deep technical blogs, and events
Drive value creation using our product with our customers in collaboration with our customer teams by engaging in targeted and focused short-term project work to understand, experiment, refine and deploy ML-enabled features for customer use-cases



Requirements

What we're looking for


5+ years of professional experience in Machine Learning, and/or Engineering providing strong ML support, or Data Science/Statistics with 2+ years of Engineering expertise
Deep experience writing production-grade python, in addition to experience using ML frameworks, such as JAX, Tensorflow, or PyTorch
Understanding of software engineering best practices, version control, and containerization
Customer empathy and a willingness to engage directly with customers and stakeholders
Experience with deploying ML models to production and with comprehensive model risk management
Deep interest in LLMs (to start) and multimodal generative models (soon!), specifically around measuring bias or performance
Enthusiasm for staying up to date on the latest developments in the field - we operate in a nascent space with plenty of signal and plenty of noise coming from arXiv and open source projects
Knowledge of and ability to (re)learn statistical methods and contemporary ML algorithms



You might also have (nice to have, definitely not required)


Experience with public cloud services, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure
Experience or interest in interactive machine learning, HCI, human-centered ML and LLM evaluation, etc
Experience or interest in explainability and fairness of recommender systems
A body of ML-focused publications (we tend to have a presence at NeurIPS/ICML, KDD, AAAI, CHI, and the newer responsible AI conferences like SaTML, FAccT, and AIES), technical blogging, and/or open source projects
A Masters or PhD in a quantitative field - we're not sticklers for degrees (many of us have Masters/PhDs, so we intimately understand this isn't the only way to be a domain expert)



Benefits

What to expect at Arthur


Teammates who value curiosity, hard work, collaboration, and creative problem-solving -- and good swag
A team of professionals who are passionate about our work and making a positive impact through AI
A caring culture; we value and prioritize our team's physical and mental health, encouraging and celebrating life outside of work
Autonomy to pursue your role and interests with room to grow, with a team behind you that always has your back
Joy, humor, and a little dose of healthy competition (in our business, we win as a team; on company game night, may the best Arthurian win...)



We offer


Competitive compensation plus medical, dental, and vision insurance, and a 401K (with matching)
Our target base salary range for this role is $160,000 - $230,000, based on level of experience and how your skills align with role requirements
Equity in what we're building together, backed by some of the most respected VCs in the industry
A flexible learning and development budget: we'll support ways to learn and grow in the areas that matter to you
Highly discounted wellness and fitness benefits
Flexible PTO with vacation minimums, which we really want you to take and enjoy
The ability to work in a highly flexible hybrid environment - both from home, and from our NYC office with our team

Our evaluation system is based on the full enhancement of people and their continuous dialogue as a stimulus for regular, mutual professional and personal growth. Transparent discussions between managers and team members are set up within the projects, where reciprocal and timely feedback is exchanged. The process is fully digitalized and aimed at continuously improving the development trajectory of the individual and the company.

Prometeia means ongoing training. We provide an average of 11 days of training per year to our people, in person and online. Particular attention is paid to younger colleagues, who are the protagonists of dedicated growth programs, and to the continuous sharing and internal transfer of know-how and skills. On-the-job training is also important, through immediate and direct confrontation with the market.

Clients, People of the Group, Alumni, Institutions, Academia, non-profit entities with which we actively collaborate, are stakeholders representing a great value for us, in terms of trust and collaboration.




DIVERSITY

We promote and respect equal opportunities and consider differences as a value. Diversity & Inclusion are fundamental values: from the selection phase to everyday life, also through dedicated training moments to develop individual sensitivities and unicities.




IMPACT

Our Headquarter in Bologna has obtained the Leed Gold Certification, one of the highest awards that recognizes the performance of the building in terms of energy and water savings, reduction of CO2 emissions, improvement of the ecological quality of the interior, materials and resources used.
