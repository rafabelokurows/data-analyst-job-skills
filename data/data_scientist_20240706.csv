We're on a mission to transform spoken communication for individuals, teams and organizations of any size. Meetings may be our most information-rich channel for work, but suffer from a lack of structure and documentation. At Supernormal, we're solving this problem with focus, design and craft.

We've been working on this since 2019 and have customers like Snap, Salesforce, Replay, Gitcoin, Pinterest and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we are growing rapidly and are excited for new teammates to join who are the best at what they do. We're passionately building a team that is as diverse and creative as the millions of people we serve worldwide.

Supernormal is a remote-first company and does not require co-location. We have annual team retreats and gather quarterly.

About The Role

Machine learning engineers at Supernormal build the AI that superpowers the core product experience for people's meetings including transcription, note generation, and task automation. The AI team builds reliable and secure services that use the most advanced AI models in the market to generate millions of high-quality meeting notes to a rapidly growing customer base. Our work revolves heavily around software engineering, too - we are looking for people with a drive to roll up their sleeves and get new models and features out to users as quickly as possible.

What You'll Work On

As an ML engineer on Supernormal's AI team, you will be responsible for the end-to-end development of our AI solutions for meeting notes, question answering, and task completion. Your work will encompass LLM API calls, custom model training and deployment, speech recognition, quality evaluation and fixes, retrieval augmented generation, and much more. You'll play a key role in optimizing for cost, latency, and quality. Some of the projects you'll work on include:


Prompt engineering using state-of-the-art techniques to improve the core meeting assistant scenarios
Building and shipping custom machine learning models to augment the AI stack, including improving transcript quality, reducing tokens sent to APIs, removing defects in LLM output, and extracting semi-structured data
Training and deploying custom large language models from open source using state-of-the-art techniques (LoRA, RLHF, instruction-tuning, etc)
Developing new product experiences using NLP & LLMs that get better based on user feedback & iteration while collaborating with product engineers & design team
Defining and improving business & product metrics to optimize the quality and cost of AI usage
Improving LLM-powered search and question answering (using RAG) over sets of meetings
Advocating for, and building, new and better ways of doing things. You'll leave everything you touch just a bit better than you found it



Requirements

What you will bring

We are a fast-moving startup building zero-to-one products on top of large language models. The ideal candidate has a strong machine learning background and a hacker mindset, someone who can both spin up Jupyter Notebooks to train models and also excel at writing solid, fast production code for deployment.


AI/ML Experience: Demonstrated proficiency in AI/ML with a track record of at least 3-5 years experience building machine learning systems, up to speed on the latest in NLP & LLMs, and proficient in data curation, modeling, and training models
A Solid Educational Foundation: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, AI, Mathematics, or related field; Master's degree or PhD a plus
Versatile Software Engineering Skills: A solid engineering background with a robust foundation in software engineering principles. You have written code for and supported production engineering systems.
Proficient in Python and SQL: our AI stack uses Python & PyTorch and interfaces with Ruby on Rails (bonus if you know it, but not required) and we write a lot of SQL queries on top of Snowflake to pull data


What we'll expect of you


A collaborative and open outlook — we're all about lifting each other up and getting better every day
A willingness to get deep into a problem even when it seems impossible. You'll always have support from the team
Confidence operating with high agency. We'll work together to decide what's important, but we'd love for you to bring (and build!) your own ideas
You'll come in willing to learn why things are the way they are, then suggest a better way
You'll understand that there's no difference between ""my idea"" and ""their idea."" It's our ideas and we're all responsible for it
You'll approach speed bumps and reviews through a ""how can the team level up?"" lens — let's all get better and learn, together

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe’s mission is to build the economic infrastructure for the internet. Risk Engineering brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s financial and regulatory risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. We build ML and backend systems to catch fraudsters, understand users’ cash flow and financial health, and ensure Stripe’s users are compliant with regulatory and financial partner requirements. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from financial losses that can put Stripe’s business at risk.

The Risk group consists of machine learning, backend, and full stack engineers who tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We are undertaking several new efforts, where you can have an outsized impact on the architecture, implementation, and design choices behind these systems.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching models
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly reduce Stripe’s financial losses
Building systems that evaluate businesses for risk and take appropriate actions
Working with our partner teams to launch new policies that directly impact Stripe’s bottom line
Helping engineers across the company to develop technologies for scaling our infrastructure
Debugging production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 2 years of industry experience in training ML models
Enjoy and have experience shipping ML models in a large-scale production environment
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


Have experience in Python, Scala (Spark), or Ruby



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Machine Learning Infrastructure group at Stripe aims to provide state of the art infrastructure and support for building and operationalizing AI/ML models for all business verticals within the company, including but not limited to models that mitigate risks across Stripe’s products and services globally, and models that help our customers to fight fraud by leveraging Stripe’s user facing products like Radar and Identity. ML is a top priority for Stripe in the coming years. With the phenomenal developments happening in the field of AI, we are positioned to accelerate the adoption of AI/ML across all parts of the company by building highly scalable and reliable foundational infrastructure.

What you’ll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching machine learning models using tools such as XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch.
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly impact Stripe’s top line metrics.
Propose new feature ideas and design data pipelines to incorporate them into our models
Improve the way we evaluate and monitor our model and system performance
Collaborate with stakeholders and drive end-to-end projects involving a variety of technologies and systems to successful completion.



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


At least 5 years of industry experience doing end-to-end ML development on a machine learning team and bringing ML models to production
Advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. computer science, statistics, physics, …)
Proficient in Python, Scala, Spark



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Hands-on applied ML (model training, deployment to production, etc) experience
You keep up-to-date on the latest in AI engineering practices and research
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data
Knowledge about how to manipulate data to perform analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to evaluate a hypothesis.
Experience evaluating niche and upcoming ML solutions



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Machine Learning Infrastructure group at Stripe aims to provide state of the art infrastructure and support for building and operationalizing AI/ML models for all business verticals within the company, including but not limited to models that mitigate risks across Stripe’s products and services globally, and models that help our customers to fight fraud by leveraging Stripe’s user facing products like Radar and Identity. ML is a top priority for Stripe in the coming years. With the phenomenal developments happening in the field of AI, we are positioned to accelerate the adoption of AI/ML across all parts of the company by building highly scalable and reliable foundational infrastructure.

What you’ll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching machine learning models using tools such as XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch.
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly impact Stripe’s top line metrics.
Propose new feature ideas and design data pipelines to incorporate them into our models
Improve the way we evaluate and monitor our model and system performance
Collaborate with stakeholders and drive end-to-end projects involving a variety of technologies and systems to successful completion.



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


At least 5 years of industry experience doing end-to-end ML development on a machine learning team and bringing ML models to production
Advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. computer science, statistics, physics, …)
Proficient in Python, Scala, Spark



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Hands-on applied ML (model training, deployment to production, etc) experience
You keep up-to-date on the latest in AI engineering practices and research
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data
Knowledge about how to manipulate data to perform analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to evaluate a hypothesis.
Experience evaluating niche and upcoming ML solutions



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge.

You will influence your team's roadmap by sharing your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our marketing channel spend. (Insights are useful, but impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with business functions ideally with paid marketing teams and having expertise in analyzing brand campaigns.
You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate your findings and recommendations to your partner teams.
You relish turning ambiguous questions and problems into clear deliverables and insights.
You are an expert in SQL and at least one of scripting languages such as R/Python.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the metrics and reporting you need don’t exist yet.

We are helping our early stage (Pre-Seed -> Series B) portfolio companies grow their teams.

One of our portfolio companies is looking to hire a business-oriented data scientist to help accelerate their growth and product initiatives. They are focused on candidates with prior startup experience. They run a hybrid-work environment, and you will be expected to be in their office 3 days a week.

While being good at what you do are table stakes, we believe the following will make you successful in a startup:


Optimistic individuals are persistent, determined, and unwilling to give up in the face of adversity. They keep working towards a goal or objective despite setbacks or failures. Optimism often involves a combination of perseverance, resilience, and determination.
Growth-oriented individuals embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a key to success. They are willing to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. Growth-oriented individuals are curious, see learning as a lifelong process, and embrace feedback. They are willing to try new things, and are not afraid to change direction if something isn’t working.
Effective individuals collaborate well, work consistently and purposefully towards achieving their goals, efficiently manage their time, and are self-motivated. They are able to identify problems, analyze them critically, and develop effective solutions.


Please note that many early stage startups are unable to sponsor visas of any kinds (ie, no transfers, no sponsoring of student visas, or no sponsoring of new visas).

Meet Your Future Neighbors

As a Data Scientist at Nextdoor, you will be responsible for design and oversight of product experiments, and own complex analysis to drive company and product strategy.

Develop and share key strategic insights through data analysis, evaluating the performance and impact of the product team
Conduct causal inference studies to deeply understand Nextdoor’s user behavior and acquisition pattern
Build scalable metrics and dashboards to inform product strategy
Partner with cross-functional teams to support product development efforts (including product, design, engineering, marketing, and operations)
Care deeply about data quality and empowering employees to leverage data to help them succeed in their careers and help Nextdoor grow
Participate in in-person Nextdoor events, trainings, off-sites, volunteer days, and other team building exercises

What You’ll Bring To The Team


7+ years of data science and product analytics experience with at least 2+ of those years leading teams technically. MS or PhD in a quantitative discipline: statistics, operations research, computer science, engineering, applied mathematics, physics, economics, etc.
Experience in applied statistics and statistical modeling in at least one statistical software package, preferably Python
Experience in designing trustworthy experimentation and analyzing complex product a/b testing results
Expert knowledge of SQL, Python programming, including common scientific computing packages and data science tools such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to synthesize, simplify and explain complex problems to different types of audience, including executives and compile compelling narratives
Ability to solve ambiguous business problems with structured analytics framework
Innate curiosity around finding meaningful insights that inform the way we think about and develop both our product and our business strategies

The starting salary for this role is expected to range from $167,000 to $250,000 on an annualized basis, or potentially greater in the event that your 'level' of proficiency exceeds the level expected for the role. Compensation may also vary by geography.

We also expect to award a meaningful equity grant for this role. With equal quarterly vesting, your first vest date would be within the first 3 months of your start date.

Overall, total compensation will vary depending on your relevant skills, experience, and qualifications. We have you covered! Nextdoor employees can choose between a variety of great health plans. We cover 100% of your personal monthly premium for health, dental, and vision – and provide a OneMedical membership for concierge care.

Meet Your Future Neighbors

Product finance, strategy and operations (“Product FSO”) is committed to driving growth through new user acquisition and increasing engagement amongst our existing user base of Neighbors. Today, we work closely with product and engineering teams to understand the impact and trends across growth and engagement while building and maintaining quarterly and long-range forecasts.

We are looking for an entrepreneurial and driven Senior Data Scientist to build these Business Intelligence capabilities and establish the foundation of our data and analytics work. You will work closely with various cross-functional teams such as product, engineering, etc. to develop a BI layer and assist us in better understanding key metrics through causal analyses, data tooling, and dashboarding. Successful candidates will exhibit technical acumen, product sense and business savvy. You are passionate about leveraging the power of data to drive product changes with quality and agility.

Additionally, analyze data to identify trends, discrepancies, and opportunities for improvement. Provide actionable recommendations and insights to senior management to facilitate informed decision-making
Analytics and Forecasting: Conduct statistical analyses and modeling, exploratory/causal analysis, and metric development to uncover data insights that in turn better inform key decisions and enable driver-based forecasting of user activity.
Performance management support: Assist in our weekly performance tracking and management of business operations. Ensure accuracy and timeliness in performance reporting, helping the team meet its short and long-term objectives
Analytics foundation: Partner with our Analytics Engineering team to create and maintain a solid data foundation using advanced data analysis tools and techniques. Extract and manipulate large datasets to create meaningful metrics and insights that inform strategic decisions
Collaboration: Facilitate data ownership and accountability by closely partnering with data science, product, and engineering partners to improve data robustness
Participate in in-person Nextdoor events, trainings, off-sites, volunteer days, and other team building exercises
Build in-person relationships with team members and contribute to the KIND culture that Nextdoor values


What You’ll Bring To The Team


6 - 8+ years working in data science, product analytics, or business intelligence, or equivalent (starting level is flexible)
Strategic-minded, impact-driven, and capable of incorporating larger business context into data questions and product development
Experience architecting, debugging, and executing SQL queries
Excellent knowledge of Looker (preferred) or another BI/visualization tool
Comfortable knowledge of Python or R, including common scientific computing packages and data science tools such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn

Nextdoor is where you connect to the neighborhoods that matter to you so you can belong. Our purpose is to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.

Neighbors around the world turn to Nextdoor daily to receive trusted information, give and get help, get things done, and build real-world connections with those nearby — neighbors, businesses, and public services. Today, neighbors rely on Nextdoor in more than 315,000 neighborhoods across 11 countries.

Meet Your Future Neighbors

Product finance, strategy and operations (“Product FSO”) is committed to driving growth through new user acquisition and increasing engagement amongst our existing user base of neighbors. Today, we work closely with product and engineering teams to understand the impact and trends across growth and engagement while building and maintaining our quarterly and long-range forecasts. Historically, we’ve been strong in our reporting and forecasting; however, have lacked the bandwidth and capabilities to dive deeper into our data to better understand “why” we’re seeing what we’re seeing to subsequently get to “what” we should be doing about it.

We are looking for an entrepreneurial and driven Senior Operations Data Scientist to establish the foundation of our data and analytics work. You will work closely with various cross-functional teams such as product, engineering, etc. to develop a BI layer and assist us in better understanding key metrics through causal analyses, data tooling, and dashboarding. Successful candidates will exhibit technical acumen, product sense and business savvy. You are passionate about leveraging the power of data to drive product changes with quality and agility. You are a team player.

At Nextdoor, we offer a warm and inclusive work environment that embraces a hybrid employment experience, providing a flexible experience for our valued employees.

The Impact You’ll Make

Role

The work of Product FSO is essential to the growth and success of the company and involves frequent opportunities to showcase key metrics and findings to senior leadership. In this role, you will:


Partner closely with Finance and ProdDev leads to identifying strategic, high-impact analytical problems and innovative ways to solve them with data
Insight discovery: Deliver data insights and drive for adoption through tools (e.g. dashboards, self-serve reporting), memos and presentations. Additionally, analyze data to identify trends, discrepancies, and opportunities for improvement. Provide actionable recommendations and insights to senior management to facilitate informed decision-making
Analytics support: Conduct statistical analyses and modeling, exploratory/causal analysis, and metric development to uncover data insights that in turn better inform key decisions
Performance management support: Assist in our weekly performance tracking and management of business operations. Ensure accuracy and timeliness in performance reporting, helping the team meet its short and long-term objectives
Analytics foundation: Partner with our Analytics Engineering team to create and maintain a solid data foundation using advanced data analysis tools and techniques. Extract and manipulate large datasets to create meaningful metrics and insights that inform strategic decisions
Collaboration: Facilitate data ownership and accountability by closely partnering with data science, product, and engineering partners to improve data robustness
Participate in in-person Nextdoor events, trainings, off-sites, volunteer days, and other team building exercises
Build in-person relationships with team members and contribute to the KIND culture that Nextdoor values


What You’ll Bring To The Team


Advanced degree in a quantitative field and 6 - 8+ years working in data science, product analytics, or business intelligence, or equivalent (starting level is flexible)
Strategic-minded, impact-driven, and capable of incorporating larger business context into data questions and product development
Experience architecting, debugging, and executing SQL queries
Excellent knowledge of Looker (preferred) or another BI/visualization tool
Comfortable knowledge of Python or R, including common scientific computing packages and data science tools such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn
Comfort with methods, tools, and packages for statistical modeling and machine learning
Experience formulating, running, and sharing complex analyses, including different types of experiments, cohort retention studies, and other exploratory analysis work
Intermediate knowledge of at least one big data technology such as Hive, Presto, or Spark
Excellent written and oral communication, including ability to effectively communicate complexity to a diverse group of stakeholders
Curiosity about how things work, from both a business and technical perspective
A self-starter who thrives under a high level of ambiguity and autonomy


It’s ok if you don’t have all of these requirements; if you think you’d be a good fit for the role, please get in touch with us!

Bonus Points


Past experience in solving problems in Finance or other business-facing areas
Work experience related to social or community-based products
Work experience related to small businesses and marketplaces
Work experience related to advertising and auction systems
Expertise deploying models to production
Expertise in testing and evaluating the impact of network effects
Knowledge of web applications and service-oriented architecture


Rewards

Compensation, benefits, perks, and recognition programs at Nextdoor come together to create one overall rewards package.

The starting salary for this role is expected to range from $175,000 to $210,000 on an annualized basis, or potentially greater in the event that your 'level' of proficiency exceeds the level expected for the role.

We also expect to award a meaningful equity grant for this role. With equal quarterly vesting, your first vest date would be within the first 3 months of your start date.

Overall, total compensation will vary depending on your relevant skills, experience, and qualifications. We have you covered! Nextdoor employees can choose between a variety of great health plans. We cover 100% of your personal monthly premium for health, dental, and vision – and provide a OneMedical membership for concierge care.

At Nextdoor, we empower our employees to build stronger local communities. To create a platform where all feel welcome, we want our workforce to reflect the diversity of the neighbors we seek to serve. We encourage everyone interested in our purpose to apply.

We are helping our early stage (Pre-Seed -> Series B) portfolio companies grow their teams.

A portfolio company is looking to hire machine learning engineers as their sales increase and they confirm product-market fit.

While being good at what you do are table stakes, we believe the following will make you successful in a startup:


Optimistic individuals are persistent, determined, and unwilling to give up in the face of adversity. They keep working towards a goal or objective despite setbacks or failures. Optimism often involves a combination of perseverance, resilience, and determination.
Growth-oriented individuals embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a key to success. They are willing to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. Growth-oriented individuals are curious, see learning as a lifelong process, and embrace feedback. They are willing to try new things, and are not afraid to change direction if something isn’t working.
Effective individuals collaborate well, work consistently and purposefully towards achieving their goals, efficiently manage their time, and are self-motivated. They are able to identify problems, analyze them critically, and develop effective solutions.


Please note that many early stage startups are unable to sponsor visas of any kinds (ie, no transfers, no sponsoring of student visas, or no sponsoring of new visas).

We're on a mission to transform spoken communication for individuals, teams and organizations of any size. Meetings may be our most information-rich channel for work, but suffer from a lack of structure and documentation. At Supernormal, we're solving this problem with focus, design and craft.

We've been working on this since 2019 and have customers like Snap, Salesforce, Replay, Gitcoin, Pinterest and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we are growing rapidly and are excited for new teammates to join who are the best at what they do. We're passionately building a team that is as diverse and creative as the millions of people we serve worldwide.

Supernormal is a remote-first company and does not require co-location. We have annual team retreats and gather quarterly.

About The Role

Machine learning engineers at Supernormal build the AI that superpowers the core product experience for people's meetings including transcription, note generation, and task automation. The AI team builds reliable and secure services that use the most advanced AI models in the market to generate millions of high-quality meeting notes to a rapidly growing customer base. Our work revolves heavily around software engineering, too - we are looking for people with a drive to roll up their sleeves and get new models and features out to users as quickly as possible.

What You'll Work On

As an ML engineer on Supernormal's AI team, you will be responsible for the end-to-end development of our AI solutions for meeting notes, question answering, and task completion. Your work will encompass LLM API calls, custom model training and deployment, speech recognition, quality evaluation and fixes, retrieval augmented generation, and much more. You'll play a key role in optimizing for cost, latency, and quality. Some of the projects you'll work on include:


Prompt engineering using state-of-the-art techniques to improve the core meeting assistant scenarios
Building and shipping custom machine learning models to augment the AI stack, including improving transcript quality, reducing tokens sent to APIs, removing defects in LLM output, and extracting semi-structured data
Training and deploying custom large language models from open source using state-of-the-art techniques (LoRA, RLHF, instruction-tuning, etc)
Developing new product experiences using NLP & LLMs that get better based on user feedback & iteration while collaborating with product engineers & design team
Defining and improving business & product metrics to optimize the quality and cost of AI usage
Improving LLM-powered search and question answering (using RAG) over sets of meetings
Advocating for, and building, new and better ways of doing things. You'll leave everything you touch just a bit better than you found it



Requirements

What you will bring

We are a fast-moving startup building zero-to-one products on top of large language models. The ideal candidate has a strong machine learning background and a hacker mindset, someone who can both spin up Jupyter Notebooks to train models and also excel at writing solid, fast production code for deployment.


AI/ML Experience: Demonstrated proficiency in AI/ML with a track record of at least 3-5 years experience building machine learning systems, up to speed on the latest in NLP & LLMs, and proficient in data curation, modeling, and training models
A Solid Educational Foundation: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, AI, Mathematics, or related field; Master's degree or PhD a plus
Versatile Software Engineering Skills: A solid engineering background with a robust foundation in software engineering principles. You have written code for and supported production engineering systems.
Proficient in Python and SQL: our AI stack uses Python & PyTorch and interfaces with Ruby on Rails (bonus if you know it, but not required) and we write a lot of SQL queries on top of Snowflake to pull data


What we'll expect of you


A collaborative and open outlook — we're all about lifting each other up and getting better every day
A willingness to get deep into a problem even when it seems impossible. You'll always have support from the team
Confidence operating with high agency. We'll work together to decide what's important, but we'd love for you to bring (and build!) your own ideas
You'll come in willing to learn why things are the way they are, then suggest a better way
You'll understand that there's no difference between ""my idea"" and ""their idea."" It's our ideas and we're all responsible for it
You'll approach speed bumps and reviews through a ""how can the team level up?"" lens — let's all get better and learn, together

We are helping our early stage (Pre-Seed -> Series B) portfolio companies grow their teams.

One of our portfolio companies is looking to hire a business-oriented data scientist to help accelerate their growth and product initiatives. They are focused on candidates with prior startup experience. They run a hybrid-work environment, and you will be expected to be in their office 3 days a week.

While being good at what you do are table stakes, we believe the following will make you successful in a startup:


Optimistic individuals are persistent, determined, and unwilling to give up in the face of adversity. They keep working towards a goal or objective despite setbacks or failures. Optimism often involves a combination of perseverance, resilience, and determination.
Growth-oriented individuals embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a key to success. They are willing to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. Growth-oriented individuals are curious, see learning as a lifelong process, and embrace feedback. They are willing to try new things, and are not afraid to change direction if something isn’t working.
Effective individuals collaborate well, work consistently and purposefully towards achieving their goals, efficiently manage their time, and are self-motivated. They are able to identify problems, analyze them critically, and develop effective solutions.


Please note that many early stage startups are unable to sponsor visas of any kinds (ie, no transfers, no sponsoring of student visas, or no sponsoring of new visas).

Description

About this role

Since our founding 30 years ago, BlackRock has brought together great minds to drive innovation. From the beginning, we have been demonstrating technology for insight and efficiency to make our business better and to help clients realize the objectives they desire. In 2018 BlackRock accelerated innovation and technology again with additional investment in artificial intelligence and data science and all the potential they represent.

The AI Labs was formed to act as a central hub with a firm-wide remit to solve strategic business challenges for the firm by bringing to bear our expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science and optimization. Our mission is to combine human and machine intelligence to revolutionize asset management.

We are a hybrid research and product team and have a responsibility to drive towards commercial impact in the form of alpha generation, operational efficiencies, and cost reduction. Building on the success of systematic investment teams with a history of demonstrating machine learning at BlackRock to create alpha, the goal was to apply these same techniques throughout the business.

Job Description

As a data scientist, you will collaborate with a distributed team of world-class academics, engineers, and investment professionals to develop methodologies for products solving a corporate-wide set of client, investor, and operational problems. Products developed often demonstrate multiple disciplines, including statistics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and optimization, and combine original methods with innovative solutions available in industry and academia. You will be responsible for the entire research lifecycle, from initial research and prototyping, to iterating on the system methodology, to detailing the final product and clearing internal review processes.

Responsibilities


Work with partners to translate business needs into well-scoped technical projects.
Efficiently interact with large and complex datasets to evaluate technical methodologies.
Rapidly prototype technical solutions implementing groundbreaking tools from optimization and machine learning.
Produce technical whitepapers and make clear technical presentations to senior management.
Work with engineers and partners to build productionized solutions that are reliable, scalable, and operate in compliance with firm-wide processes.


Qualifications


Either a PhD in a quantitative subject area (computer science, mathematics, statistics, economics, physics, engineering, or related field), or
An MS degree in a quantitative field plus 3+ years of professional experience in optimization, machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistics, or other aspects of the data science process.
Strong theoretical background in and practical experience using optimization, statistical techniques, and AI/machine learning, preferably proven through academic publications or open-source codebases.
Strong familiarity with programming languages such as Python, Julia, or R.
Experience with the analysis or application of data in finance, economics, sociology, or related fields is a plus.
Experience applying generative AI solutions (via OpenAI, HuggingFace, LlamaIndex or through Azure AI, Amazon Bedrock, Nvidia AI etc) a plus.
Experience with cloud technologies (AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure) a plus.


For California and New York City only the salary range for this position is $132,500 - $157,500. Additionally, employees are eligible for an annual discretionary bonus, and benefits including heath care, leave benefits, and retirement benefits.

As a Data Scientist you’ll delight our clients by transforming giant, complex datasets to awesome and relevant insights. You’re resourceful in finding additional data sources and recoding variables. You don’t just try to understand the past, you predict the future! You have knowledge of and experience with applying machine learning in a practical setting, where you’ll turn a good model into a great one. You communicate and present results convincingly, to create real and lasting impact.

What’s in it for you?

On top of excellent employment conditions, working at IG&H will kickstart your career through the steep learning curve. Apart from learning on the job, there will be ample trainings to boost your core consulting and people skills through the IG&H Academy. You will be assigned involved coaches, who will be there for you to provide you with guidance. Next to that, IG&H offers you an inspiring office in Utrecht, an unparalleled good working atmosphere, and abundant parties, team activities and sporting events.

“In addition to on-the-job learning, you learn everything you need to know about consultancy in the IG&H Academy. The program consists of various internal and external training courses and has been specifically developed for trainees. Besides training sessions, the Academy often organizes trips and dinners. Through these, you quickly develop good relationships with co-workers at IG&H. I see many of them outside of work on a regular basis”

Jasmijn Haverhals (Consultant Healthcare)

“The most beautiful thing about consulting is the diversity within the projects. IG&H offers next to different clients, a variety in the types of assignments. One assignment could be very strategic, in which you outline the direction of a company. Whereas another assignment could be focused on implementation, in which you are working together with the client to deliver concrete results.”
