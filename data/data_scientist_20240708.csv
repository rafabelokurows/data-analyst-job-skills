And as a Snowflake employee, you will be accountable for supporting and enabling diversity and belonging.

Snowflake started with a clear vision: make modern data warehousing effective, affordable, and accessible to all data users.

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, and India.


Please only apply to one opening. If you are a better fit for another opening, our team will move your application. Candidates who apply to multiple openings will not be considered.**


Who You Are

          <strong>About Phaidra<br><br></strong>Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.<br><br>The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.<br><br>Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:<br><br><ul><li>We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.</li><li>We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.</li><li>We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.<br><br></li></ul>Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.<br><br>Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, and India.<br><br><ul><li>Please only apply to one opening.

You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.


Data Science is an integral component of Coinbase’s product and decision making process: we work in partnership with Product, Engineering and Design to influence the roadmap and better understand our users. With a deep expertise in experimentation, analytics and advanced modeling, we produce insights which directly move the company’s bottom line.

Focus on business practicality and the 80/20 rule; very high bar for output quality, but recognize the business benefit of ""having something now"" vs ""perfection sometime in the future""
Agile development mindset, appreciating the benefit of constant iteration and improvement



It's great, but not required, if you have


Experience working in a consumer or B2C space for a SaaS product provider, or the enterprise/B2B space

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge.

You will influence your team's roadmap by sharing your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our marketing channel spend. (Insights are useful, but impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with business functions ideally with paid marketing teams and having expertise in analyzing brand campaigns.
You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate your findings and recommendations to your partner teams.
You relish turning ambiguous questions and problems into clear deliverables and insights.
You are an expert in SQL and at least one of scripting languages such as R/Python.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the metrics and reporting you need don’t exist yet.

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. The Growth Team aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and growing our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion.
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project.
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features.
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You worked on a growth product/strategy team
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.

We are helping our early stage (Pre-Seed -> Series B) portfolio companies grow their teams.

One of our portfolio companies is looking to hire a business-oriented data scientist to help accelerate their growth and product initiatives. They are focused on candidates with prior startup experience. They run a hybrid-work environment, and you will be expected to be in their office 3 days a week.

While being good at what you do are table stakes, we believe the following will make you successful in a startup:


Optimistic individuals are persistent, determined, and unwilling to give up in the face of adversity. They keep working towards a goal or objective despite setbacks or failures. Optimism often involves a combination of perseverance, resilience, and determination.
Growth-oriented individuals embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a key to success. They are willing to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. Growth-oriented individuals are curious, see learning as a lifelong process, and embrace feedback. They are willing to try new things, and are not afraid to change direction if something isn’t working.
Effective individuals collaborate well, work consistently and purposefully towards achieving their goals, efficiently manage their time, and are self-motivated. They are able to identify problems, analyze them critically, and develop effective solutions.


Please note that many early stage startups are unable to sponsor visas of any kinds (ie, no transfers, no sponsoring of student visas, or no sponsoring of new visas).

Nextdoor is where you connect to the neighborhoods that matter to you so you can belong. Our purpose is to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.

Neighbors around the world turn to Nextdoor daily to receive trusted information, give and get help, get things done, and build real-world connections with those nearby — neighbors, businesses, and public services. Today, neighbors rely on Nextdoor in more than 315,000 neighborhoods across 11 countries.

Meet Your Future Neighbors

Product finance, strategy and operations (“Product FSO”) is committed to driving growth through new user acquisition and increasing engagement amongst our existing user base of Neighbors. Today, we work closely with product and engineering teams to understand the impact and trends across growth and engagement while building and maintaining quarterly and long-range forecasts. Historically, we’ve been strong in our reporting and forecasting; however, are still building the bandwidth and capabilities to dive deeper into our data to better understand “why” we’re seeing what we’re seeing to subsequently get to “what” we should be doing about it.

We are looking for an entrepreneurial and driven Senior Data Scientist to build these Business Intelligence capabilities and establish the foundation of our data and analytics work. You will work closely with various cross-functional teams such as product, engineering, etc. to develop a BI layer and assist us in better understanding key metrics through causal analyses, data tooling, and dashboarding. Successful candidates will exhibit technical acumen, product sense and business savvy. You are passionate about leveraging the power of data to drive product changes with quality and agility. You are a team player.

At Nextdoor, we offer a warm and inclusive work environment that embraces a hybrid employment experience, providing a flexible experience for our valued employees.

The Impact You’ll Make

Insight discovery: Deliver data insights and drive for adoption through tools (e.g. dashboards, self-serve reporting), memos and presentations. Additionally, analyze data to identify trends, discrepancies, and opportunities for improvement. Provide actionable recommendations and insights to senior management to facilitate informed decision-making
Analytics and Forecasting: Conduct statistical analyses and modeling, exploratory/causal analysis, and metric development to uncover data insights that in turn better inform key decisions and enable driver-based forecasting of user activity.
Performance management support: Assist in our weekly performance tracking and management of business operations. Ensure accuracy and timeliness in performance reporting, helping the team meet its short and long-term objectives
Analytics foundation: Partner with our Analytics Engineering team to create and maintain a solid data foundation using advanced data analysis tools and techniques. Extract and manipulate large datasets to create meaningful metrics and insights that inform strategic decisions
Collaboration: Facilitate data ownership and accountability by closely partnering with data science, product, and engineering partners to improve data robustness
Participate in in-person Nextdoor events, trainings, off-sites, volunteer days, and other team building exercises
Build in-person relationships with team members and contribute to the KIND culture that Nextdoor values


What You’ll Bring To The Team


6 - 8+ years working in data science, product analytics, or business intelligence, or equivalent (starting level is flexible)
Strategic-minded, impact-driven, and capable of incorporating larger business context into data questions and product development
Experience architecting, debugging, and executing SQL queries
Excellent knowledge of Looker (preferred) or another BI/visualization tool
Comfortable knowledge of Python or R, including common scientific computing packages and data science tools such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn

Intermediate knowledge of at least one big data technology such as Hive, Presto, or Spark
Excellent written and oral communication, including ability to effectively communicate complexity to a diverse group of stakeholders
Curiosity about how things work, from both a business and technical perspective
A self-starter who thrives under a high level of ambiguity and autonomy

Meet Your Future Neighbors

Today, we work closely with product and engineering teams to understand the impact and trends across growth and engagement while building and maintaining our quarterly and long-range forecasts. Historically, we’ve been strong in our reporting and forecasting; however, have lacked the bandwidth and capabilities to dive deeper into our data to better understand “why” we’re seeing what we’re seeing to subsequently get to “what” we should be doing about it.

We are looking for an entrepreneurial and driven Senior Operations Data Scientist to establish the foundation of our data and analytics work. You will work closely with various cross-functional teams such as product, engineering, etc. to develop a BI layer and assist us in better understanding key metrics through causal analyses, data tooling, and dashboarding.

Additionally, analyze data to identify trends, discrepancies, and opportunities for improvement. Provide actionable recommendations and insights to senior management to facilitate informed decision-making
Analytics support: Conduct statistical analyses and modeling, exploratory/causal analysis, and metric development to uncover data insights that in turn better inform key decisions
Performance management support: Assist in our weekly performance tracking and management of business operations. Ensure accuracy and timeliness in performance reporting, helping the team meet its short and long-term objectives
Analytics foundation: Partner with our Analytics Engineering team to create and maintain a solid data foundation using advanced data analysis tools and techniques. Extract and manipulate large datasets to create meaningful metrics and insights that inform strategic decisions
Collaboration: Facilitate data ownership and accountability by closely partnering with data science, product, and engineering partners to improve data robustness
Participate in in-person Nextdoor events, trainings, off-sites, volunteer days, and other team building exercises
Build in-person relationships with team members and contribute to the KIND culture that Nextdoor values


What You’ll Bring To The Team


Advanced degree in a quantitative field and 6 - 8+ years working in data science, product analytics, or business intelligence, or equivalent (starting level is flexible)
Strategic-minded, impact-driven, and capable of incorporating larger business context into data questions and product development
Experience architecting, debugging, and executing SQL queries
Excellent knowledge of Looker (preferred) or another BI/visualization tool
Comfortable knowledge of Python or R, including common scientific computing packages and data science tools such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn
Comfort with methods, tools, and packages for statistical modeling and machine learning
Experience formulating, running, and sharing complex analyses, including different types of experiments, cohort retention studies, and other exploratory analysis work

We are helping our early stage (Pre-Seed -> Series B) portfolio companies grow their teams.

A portfolio company is looking to hire machine learning engineers as their sales increase and they confirm product-market fit.

While being good at what you do are table stakes, we believe the following will make you successful in a startup:


Optimistic individuals are persistent, determined, and unwilling to give up in the face of adversity. They keep working towards a goal or objective despite setbacks or failures. Optimism often involves a combination of perseverance, resilience, and determination.
Growth-oriented individuals embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a key to success. They are willing to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. Growth-oriented individuals are curious, see learning as a lifelong process, and embrace feedback. They are willing to try new things, and are not afraid to change direction if something isn’t working.
Effective individuals collaborate well, work consistently and purposefully towards achieving their goals, efficiently manage their time, and are self-motivated. They are able to identify problems, analyze them critically, and develop effective solutions.


Please note that many early stage startups are unable to sponsor visas of any kinds (ie, no transfers, no sponsoring of student visas, or no sponsoring of new visas).

We’re on a mission to make knowledge work faster and more humane. We believe that AI will fundamentally transform how people work. In the future, everyone will work in tandem with expert AI assistants who find knowledge, create and synthesize information, and execute work. These assistants will free people up to focus on the higher-level, creative aspects of their work.

We’re building a system of intelligence for every company in the world. On the surface, you can think of it as Google + ChatGPT for the enterprise. Under the hood, our platform is the connective tissue between AI and knowledge. It brings all of a company’s knowledge together, understands it at a deep level, provides industry-leading search relevance over it, and connects it to generative AI agents and applications.

Glean was founded by a seasoned team of former Google search and Facebook engineers who saw a need in the enterprise space for their technical depth and passion for AI. We’re a diverse team of curious and creative people who want to help each other get big things done—so we can help other teams do the same.

We're backed by some of the Valley's leading venture capitalists—including Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, and General Catalyst—and have assembled a world-class team with senior leadership experience at Google, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox, Rubrik, Uber, Intercom, Pinterest, Palantir, and others.

Role

Glean is building a world-class Data Organization composed of data science, applied science, data engineering and business intelligence groups. This is a data science role based in our headquarters in Palo Alto.

At Glean, data scientists collaborate with engineering, product management and design to:


Define and build data assets, e.g. KPI definitions, data pipelines and dashboards, to measure the performance of AI-powered assistant products for knowledge workers.
Identify opportunities to improve these KPIs, and influence cross functional teams to incorporate associated changes into their roadmaps.
Create and maintain quantitative frameworks and methodologies, e.g. bring more rigor into experiment analyses, use statistical modeling to identify leading indicators of user churn & retention.


This specific role will address one or more of the following business domains:


Accelerating Glean’s adoption, expansion, and usage intensity across all the product surfaces and customer lifecycles by using data to identify, implement and measure the effectiveness of product-led user growth strategies.
Build data assets, e.g. KPI definitions, data pipelines and dashboards, to measure the efficacy of generative AI products executing workflows on behalf of end users, instead of just answering questions and helping them find what they need.

Growth-oriented individuals embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a key to success. They are willing to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. Growth-oriented individuals are curious, see learning as a lifelong process, and embrace feedback.

Generate:Biomedicines is a new kind of therapeutics company – existing at the intersection of machine learning, biological engineering, and medicine – pioneering Generative Biology™ to create breakthrough medicines where novel therapeutics are computationally generated, instead of being discovered. The Company has built a machine learning-powered biomedicines platform with the potential to generate new drugs across a wide range of biologic modalities. This platform represents a potentially fundamental shift in what is possible in the field of biotherapeutic development.

We pursue this audacious vision because we believe in the unique and revolutionary power of generative biology to radically transform the lives of billions, with an outsized opportunity for patients in need. We are seeking collaborative, relentless problem solvers that share our passion for impact to join us!

Generate:Biomedicines was founded in 2018 by Flagship Pioneering and has received nearly $700 million in funding, providing the resources to rapidly scale the organization. The Company has offices in Somerville and Andover, Massachusetts with over 300 employees.

The Role:

Generation of novel proteins through data-driven machine learning models is at the core of Generate:Biomedicine’s platform. We aim to upend the traditional approach to drug development towards one characterized by intentionality, surgical precision, and speed by developing methods for protein generation that can reliably generalize across biological functions, disease areas, and therapeutic modalities.

We are seeking creative, motivated Machine Learning Scientists to develop and apply our core technologies for ML-powered protein generation. They will join a vibrant and growing machine learning group at the Company to develop innovative methods for protein generation and modeling, leveraging both in-house and external data to train and evaluate models while also deploying new algorithms into production on our experimental platform. The successful candidate will work closely with experimental scientists from Protein Sciences and Medicines groups to rapidly advance the scientific program.

Here's How You Will Contribute:


Develop novel machine learning models and algorithms for data-driven generation of proteins, and hone them through deployment on our experimental platform.
Advance and evaluate the state of the art for machine learning models of protein sequence, structure, and function, including but not limited to protein sequence design, structure prediction, complex prediction, and function learning.
Use our integrated data platform to devise models able to leverage measured labels “in-the-loop”.
Work with Protein Sciences and Medicines groups to tailor modeling efforts toward high-impact therapeutic applications.
Develop production-quality code in a team setting and work with MLOps for deploying and training models at scale.
Present progress from scientific work in regular research meetings and prepare reports and slide decks for broader internal and external communication.


The Ideal Candidate Will Have:


PhD in Computational Biology, Computer Science, or a related field with demonstrated experience working on scientific applications
3+ years of experience with developing Machine Learning methods to solve scientific problems, with a particular interest towards applications to protein modeling as well as adjacent fields such as genomics, chemistry, immunology, or physics
Experience developing, debugging, and applying models using modern deep learning frameworks.
Proficiency in Python and experience analyzing data with Numpy/Scipy, R, or similar.


Nice to have:


Foundational knowledge around probabilistic machine learning and optimization methods
Practical experience developing deep generative models (e.g., autoregressive models, VAEs, Flows, GANs, EBMs etc.)
Publications in major ML conferences or scientific journals that apply ML to problems in molecular biology, structural biology, or genetics, especially at the intersection of machine learning and proteins.
Demonstrated experience developing software in a team setting.
Experience with optimizing performant code.


Generate:Biomedicines is committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Ready to ? Who you are:


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

          <p>Bicycle Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel class of medicines, referred to as Bicycle<em>®</em> molecules, for diseases that are underserved by existing therapeutics. Bicycle molecules are fully synthetic short peptides constrained with small molecule scaffolds to form two loops that stabilize their structural geometry. This constraint facilitates target binding with high affinity and selectivity, making Bicycle molecules attractive candidates for drug development. The company is evaluating BT8009, a Bicycle<em>®</em> Toxin Conjugate (BTC<em>®</em>) targeting Nectin-4, a well-validated tumor antigen; BT5528, a BTC targeting EphA2, a historically undruggable target; and BT7480, a Bicycle Tumor-Targeted Immune Cell Agonist<em>®</em> (Bicycle TICA<em>®</em>) targeting Nectin-4 and agonizing CD137, in company-sponsored clinical trials. Additionally, the company is developing Bicycle<em>®</em> Radio Conjugates (BRC™) for radiopharmaceutical use and, through various partnerships, is exploring the use of Bicycle<em>®</em> technology to develop therapies for diseases beyond oncology.</p><p>Bicycle Therapeutics is headquartered in Cambridge, UK, with many key functions and members of its leadership team located in Cambridge, MA.</p><p><strong>Culture</strong> is key and all Bicycle employees actively embrace and role model our company values:</p><ul><li>Weare<strong>Adventurous</strong>.We believe it’sthewaytodeliverextraordinaryresultsforourpatients.</li><li>Weare<strong>DedicatedtoourMission</strong>.Youcan’tchangetheworldifyoudon’thavedetermination.</li><li>Weare<strong>OneTeam</strong>.Weonlysucceedwhenweworktogether.<br><br></li></ul><strong>Job Description<br><br></strong><p>We are looking to recruit a Senior data scientist with a strong software engineering and data analytics skillset as well as an oncology background to join our Translational Sciences team.

Sunshine Act

Pfizer reports payments and other transfers of value to health care providers as required by federal and state transparency laws and implementing regulations. These laws and regulations require Pfizer to provide government agencies with information such as a health care provider’s name, address and the type of payments or other value received, generally for public disclosure. Subject to further legal review and statutory or regulatory clarification, which Pfizer intends to pursue, reimbursement of recruiting expenses for licensed physicians may constitute a reportable transfer of value under the federal transparency law commonly known as the Sunshine Act. Therefore, if you are a licensed physician who incurs recruiting expenses as a result of interviewing with Pfizer that we pay or reimburse, your name, address and the amount of payments made currently will be reported to the government. If you have questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact your Talent Acquisition representative.
