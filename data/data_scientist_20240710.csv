Want to make an impact? Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.

We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.

Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, we work closely with our teams in Barcelona, San Antonio, Spokane, and remote locations. We’ve got a reputation for being a great place to work, having been named among the 100 Best Companies to Work For in Seattle Business Magazine and Washington’s Best Workplaces in the Puget Sound Business Journal. We're an agile, fast-growing company, and our leadership comes from some of the world's most respected tech companies.

At Rover, our furry coworkers are just as important as our human ones—and we wouldn’t have it any other way. Along with making the joys of pet parenthood more accessible, we’re committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community of pet people—and that starts with our employees.

Who we're looking for:

We are looking for people who understand that behind every data point there is a pet and a person. When you develop and deploy an algorithm, you are not just producing a score or rule set, you are altering the customer experience and impacting the business in measurable ways. You should be excited to tackle a broad array of problems facing a two-sided marketplace and work in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.

What does Data Science mean at Rover?

At Rover, we obsess over our customers’ needs, relying heavily on data to improve the customer journey, and to continuously optimize outcomes in our marketplaces. Our entire organization is metric driven and underpinned by data science and analytics. Data scientists are responsible for defining the right metrics, understanding nuanced marketplace dynamics, and developing models and algorithms that power our business and technology.

As a Data Scientist on the Booking Data Science team, you will:


Collaborate closely with business, product, marketing, and operations teams to pinpoint opportunities for enhanced efficiency in our marketplace
Support business expansion by localizing existing models, such as search rankings and marketplace business intelligence to serve new markets.
Dive deep into marketplace dynamics, extracting valuable insights and providing strategic recommendations to shape our product offerings, using your skills in data mining and data visualization
Perform statistical analysis to draw inferences, forecast future trends, and predict user behavior
Develop and refine models that aim to improve matching efficiency and to retain customers on our platform, utilizing predictive analytics and machine learning techniques
Design, build, and maintain robust data pipelines that serve as the backbone for informed decision-making, monitoring of our systems and as algorithmic inputs
Design, setup and analyze marketplace experiments (e.g. A/B testing, before-after analyses) of your data science pipelines, often in close collaboration with product managers and engineers.



Your Toolset Includes:


Intermediate SQL – you know about window functions, complex joins, and love to write efficient, readable queries.
Data visualization fundamentals
Basic working knowledge of Python or R to develop and evaluate models
(nice to have) Experience with big data technology (e.g. Spark, Redshift, AWS)



Your Qualifications:


At least 1 year of experience in a business setting as a data scientist or analyst
BS in a quantitative discipline; advanced degree (MS or PhD) a plus
Understanding of foundational statistical concepts including probability, hypothesis testing, and experimental design
(nice to have) Robust foundation and some practical experience with one or more contemporary machine learning methods is a plus
(nice to have) Experience in a two-sided marketplace is a plus
We welcome candidates wanting to transition from a quantitative academic discipline into data science



Why We'll Hire You:


You’re a deeply analytical thinker who is passionate about finding structure in data, and using data to drive real value to the end user (and thus the business)
You are excited both about analysis and model building. You’re not afraid to tackle ambiguous analytical questions or impactful production-facing models, depending on business needs.
You are passionate about our core business. You will instinctively dig into every aspect of what it means to be a pet sitter and a pet owner on the Rover platform
You can take abstractly defined problems and work with (imperfect) data to drive decisions
You’re able to fit and interpret results of statistical models, as well as report on key assumptions and limitations
You show a pattern of being self-started, self-taught and self-directed
You favor open communication with willingness to ask and answer questions
You are output- and outcome-oriented
You have excellent written and verbal communication skills in English, with the ability to break apart complex processes for non-technical stakeholders
You play nicely with others (and dogs)

Grab snacks, fresh fruit, in our kitchen to keep yourself going

We are seeking New Grad Software Engineers excited about working in Artificial Intelligence, to join our dynamic team. The ideal candidate will be responsible for learning from more senior members of the team to integrate AI capabilities into our existing product, ensuring seamless functionality and an enhanced user experience.

Simple challenges and easy tasks are not what you will encounter in our team. We are dealing with one of the most complex and unexplored areas of software development, where best practices are just being developed - and you can be part of this expedition!

In our team, we need more than just standard software engineering skills. You will need to:


Collaborate with product managers and cross-functional teams to understand AI requirements and potential applications.
Design, develop, and integrate AI models and algorithms into the product's existing software architecture.
Ensure the scalability, performance, and reliability of AI-enhanced features.
Understand AI training, validation, and testing to guarantee optimal performance of AI components.
Learn about the latest developments in AI and machine learning supporting our leaders to ensure our product remains at the forefront of technological advancements.

Document AI integration processes, solutions, and best practices for future reference and team knowledge sharing.
Regularly review and refine AI-enhancements based on user feedback and analytics.
Participate in code reviews, team meetings, and ongoing training sessions to continuously improve team collaboration and personal skillset.



Although we have different roles in the team, they mainly help us understand individual responsibilities, but are not strongly hierarchical. Quite the opposite - we expect everyone to help the whole team and the product be better through ideas, honest feedback, and the unique perspectives that only you can bring into the discussions.

We encourage you to apply if you have most (or all!) of the following


Computer Science degree or proven experience in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math).
Passion for AI and its applications.
Experience with Java or a similar object-oriented programming language with the ability to write programs and apply OOP principles.

Are you the one?




Who are we?




We are a scale-up in a 📈 hyper-growth phase so we need to ensure that our product can scale up, and we need your 🧠 brain for this!




On the contextual side, by combining Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, our proprietary Machine Learning-based technology provides a human-like understanding of the content of the web. We find the best context for each ad, while providing unparalleled risk-mitigation capabilities that protect advertisers from showing their ads on pages that could be damaging to their brand. All of this, without relying on cookies or any other tracking mechanisms.




On the AdExchange side, we are creating the most efficient exchange in the market by combining Optimization, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning techniques. We put together the most valuable sources of demand and supply. From our Floor Strategy on the channel side to our Header Bidding solution at the preBid connector, the AdExchange becomes smarter every day.

We want you to 💡 innovate and we have plenty of space for you to develop professionally!




As leaders of ⚙️ Contextual Advertising Technologies; at Seedtag, our goal is to promote a better advertising industry where effective advertising respects users' privacy and experience.




Key Figures




2014 · Founded

2018 · 16M€ total turnover getting growth and going international

2021 · Raised 40M€ , 230 Seedtaggers in 10 countries

2022 · Raised 250M€ , expanding into the U.S market

👉 2024 · Where will you bring us? 😎




What are our challenges?

…in numbers 🤯:

We handle more than 180 billion of events per day
We process on average 600,000 web pages per hour
Our CDN serves 1.5 petabytes every month to 200 million devices worldwide

So... it’s all about 🏎️ speed and infrastructure reliance.

Your 😎 mission (if you accept it) is to make our platform more intelligent.




Your Challenge: build the intelligence of our AdExchange

The AdExchange is the space where supply opportunities (ad slots) are matched to advertising demand items (ads). Just like the former trading pits in the stock market, opportunities to sell and buy are constantly created and resolved.




To make the most of this flow of monetization opportunities, we develop, train and deploy different Machine Learning models. At our AdExhange, you will find a myriad of use cases, each requiring different mathematical and infrastructure solutions. Our approach is strongly product-oriented, with a firm mathematical basis and proficient software development practices.




You will work close to the production environment and hand-to-hand with the team’s Data Scientists, MLOps and Data engineers, getting immediate feedback on the response of your solution. From your head to the cluster, you will have a barrier-free highway and a proactive team around you to support your work and ideas.




🚀 This is a high-impact project that will shape the future of Seedtag.
🕵🏻 You will work identifying, exploring, and making sense of data sources.
🧑‍💼 You will partner closely with the Data component of our squad, to enhance the delivery of the intelligence into the AdExchange.
⚙️ You will develop machine learning solutions to solve business problems: anomaly detection, price optimization, etc.
💻 You will develop and deploy production-oriented data software.




If you are up to the challenge and want to be a part of a talented and passionate team, we encourage you to apply for this position.




Our core values




🎯 Outcome over output

Our core tech values reflect our commitment to delivering exceptional results, fostering a culture of continuous learning, and always putting the customer's needs first. We believe that success comes from focusing on the outcomes rather than just the output. Our tech team aims to solve problems that make a meaningful difference, and we measure our success by the impact we have on the customer.




💡Failure is allowed, learning is a must

We also recognize that failure is an inevitable part of the innovation process. Our team understands that setbacks are opportunities to learn and grow. We believe in testing early and often, and we continuously iterate and improve until we arrive at the best solution.




👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 We are all scouts

Another core value we hold is that we are all scouts. We believe in leaving things better than we found them. This means we take ownership of our work and strive to improve the systems and processes we touch. We encourage our team members to be proactive in identifying areas for improvement, and we value those who take the initiative to implement positive changes. Our goal is to leave a lasting, positive impact on our projects and our team.




📊 We are data-driven

Lastly, our team is data-driven. We believe that making informed decisions based on data is crucial to our success. Our engineering team uses data to guide our decision-making process and to identify opportunities for improvement. We are committed to using data to continuously monitor and optimize our systems and processes to ensure that we are delivering the best possible outcome for our customers.




How do we work?

Our modelling stack consists of a series of well-stablished Python frameworks such as Scikit Learn/Spacy/Torch/Tensorflow, but we embrace the adoption of new cool tools.

Our backend consists of a series of containerized (Docker) microservices built in Python, and deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.




Our MLOps infrastructure is built upon MLFlow and DVC to track, trace and register the models, the metrics, and the data. We love automatizing things, and our deployments are triggered via Jenkins for the code, and MLFlow for the models. Every service API we build is self-managed, so that you can fine-tune every detail of the serving process.




Our cloud infrastructure runs on Google Cloud. We store data in Redis, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, GCS, and other storage systems. We love kafka, event-based and data-streaming architecture models.




You Will Succeed If:

🚀 You have 4-5 years of solid experience in data science and machine learning.
🧐 You (preferentially) have a degree in computer science, engineering, statistics, mathematics, physics or another degree with a strong quantitative component.
📐You understand the theoretical functioning of the main algorithms in ML and you have experience applying these to real problems.
⚙️ You care about producing maintainable code over time using good programming practices. you have experience in testing and with CI/CD tools.
🌟 Nice to have: you have experience deploying models into production with docker and kubernetes. You are familiar with the MLOps universe.
🛠️ You have ample experience with one or more of these machine learning tools: Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc.
🤔 You are a big-picture thinker who can see the forest and the trees. You have a strong understanding of the technical and business requirements of the projects you work on, and you can think strategically to ensure that your work aligns with the goals of the company.
💡 You are a problem solver who loves a good challenge. You are energized by tackling complex technical problems and figuring out creative solutions.
📚 You are a continuous learner who is passionate about your craft. You are committed to staying up-to-date with the latest developments in back-end engineering and are always looking for ways to improve your skills and knowledge.
🤝 You are a strong communicator who can work effectively in a team. You are comfortable working collaboratively with others, and you are able to effectively communicate complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
🏎️ You are adaptable and flexible. You are comfortable working in a dynamic, fast-paced environment, and you are able to adjust to changing priorities and requirements.

If you possess these qualities and are excited about the opportunity to work on challenging, high-impact projects with a talented and passionate team, we encourage you to apply for this position.

WHO WE ARE

Seedtag is the leading Contextual Advertising Platform. Our proprietary, machine learning-based technology provides a human-like understanding of the content on the web, the highest level of brand safety in the industry and unmatched cookieless targeting capabilities.

We engage with the market on both demand and supply sides to create, activate and launch high-quality advertising campaigns at scale. We are committed to creating a more beautiful, respectful and engaging way to do advertising.

The AdExchange is the space where supply opportunities (ad slots) are matched to advertising demand items (ads). Just like the former trading pits in the stock market, opportunities to sell and buy are constantly created and resolved.

To make the most of this flow of monetization opportunities, we develop, train and deploy different Machine Learning models. At our AdExhange, you will find a myriad of use cases, each requiring different mathematical and infrastructure solutions. Our approach is strongly product-oriented, with a firm mathematical basis and proficient software development practices.

You will work close to the production environment and hand-to-hand with the team’s Data Scientists, MLOps and Data engineers, getting immediate feedback on the response of your solution. From your head to the cluster, you will have a barrier-free highway and a proactive team around you to support your work and ideas.

This is a high-impact project that will shape the future of Seedtag
You will work on identifying, exploring, and making sense of data sources
You will partner closely with the Data component of our squad, to enhance the delivery of the intelligence into the AdExchange
You will develop machine learning solutions to solve business problems: anomaly detection, price optimization, etc.
You will develop and deploy production-oriented data software




YOU WILL SUCCEED IN THIS ROLE IF

You have 2-4 years of solid experience in data science and machine learning
You (preferentially) have a degree in computer science, engineering, statistics, mathematics, physics or another degree with a strong quantitative component.
You understand the theoretical functioning of the main algorithms in ML and you have experience applying these to real problems
You have ample experience with one or more of these machine learning tools: Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc.
You have a strong understanding of the technical and business requirements of the projects you work on, and you can think strategically to ensure that your work aligns with the goals of the company.
You are energized by tackling complex technical problems and figuring out creative solutions.
You are committed to staying up-to-date with the latest developments in back-end engineering and are always looking for ways to improve your skills and knowledge.
You are comfortable working collaboratively with others, and you are able to effectively communicate complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
You are comfortable working in a dynamic, fast-paced environment, and you are able to adjust to changing priorities and requirements.

Are you the one?




Who are we?




We are a scale-up in a 📈 hyper-growth phase so we need to ensure that our product can scale up, and we need your 🧠 brain for this!




On the contextual side, by combining Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, our proprietary Machine Learning-based technology provides a human-like understanding of the content of the web. We find the best context for each ad, while providing unparalleled risk-mitigation capabilities that protect advertisers from showing their ads on pages that could be damaging to their brand. All of this, without relying on cookies or any other tracking mechanisms.




On the AdExchange side, we are creating the most efficient exchange in the market by combining Optimization, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning techniques. We put together the most valuable sources of demand and supply. From our Floor Strategy on the channel side to our Header Bidding solution at the preBid connector, the AdExchange becomes smarter every day.

We want you to 💡 innovate and we have plenty of space for you to develop professionally!




As leaders of ⚙️ Contextual Advertising Technologies; at Seedtag, our goal is to promote a better advertising industry where effective advertising respects users' privacy and experience.




Key Figures




2014 · Founded

2018 · 16M€ total turnover getting growth and going international

2021 · Raised 40M€ , 230 Seedtaggers in 10 countries

2022 · Raised 250M€ , expanding into the U.S market

👉 2024 · Where will you bring us? 😎




What are our challenges?

…in numbers 🤯:

We handle more than 180 billion of events per day
We process on average 600,000 web pages per hour
Our CDN serves 1.5 petabytes every month to 200 million devices worldwide

So... it’s all about 🏎️ speed and infrastructure reliance.

Your 😎 mission (if you accept it) is to make our platform more intelligent.




Your Challenge: build the intelligence of our AdExchange

The AdExchange is the space where supply opportunities (ad slots) are matched to advertising demand items (ads). Just like the former trading pits in the stock market, opportunities to sell and buy are constantly created and resolved.




To make the most of this flow of monetization opportunities, we develop, train and deploy different Machine Learning models. At our AdExhange, you will find a myriad of use cases, each requiring different mathematical and infrastructure solutions. Our approach is strongly product-oriented, with a firm mathematical basis and proficient software development practices.




You will work close to the production environment and hand-to-hand with the team’s Data Scientists, MLOps and Data engineers, getting immediate feedback on the response of your solution. From your head to the cluster, you will have a barrier-free highway and a proactive team around you to support your work and ideas.




🚀 This is a high-impact project that will shape the future of Seedtag.
🕵🏻 You will work identifying, exploring, and making sense of data sources.
🧑‍💼 You will partner closely with the Data component of our squad, to enhance the delivery of the intelligence into the AdExchange.
⚙️ You will develop machine learning solutions to solve business problems: anomaly detection, price optimization, etc.
💻 You will develop and deploy production-oriented data software.




If you are up to the challenge and want to be a part of a talented and passionate team, we encourage you to apply for this position.




Our core values




🎯 Outcome over output

Our core tech values reflect our commitment to delivering exceptional results, fostering a culture of continuous learning, and always putting the customer's needs first. We believe that success comes from focusing on the outcomes rather than just the output. Our tech team aims to solve problems that make a meaningful difference, and we measure our success by the impact we have on the customer.




💡Failure is allowed, learning is a must

We also recognize that failure is an inevitable part of the innovation process. Our team understands that setbacks are opportunities to learn and grow. We believe in testing early and often, and we continuously iterate and improve until we arrive at the best solution.




👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 We are all scouts

Another core value we hold is that we are all scouts. We believe in leaving things better than we found them. This means we take ownership of our work and strive to improve the systems and processes we touch. We encourage our team members to be proactive in identifying areas for improvement, and we value those who take the initiative to implement positive changes. Our goal is to leave a lasting, positive impact on our projects and our team.




📊 We are data-driven

Lastly, our team is data-driven. We believe that making informed decisions based on data is crucial to our success. Our engineering team uses data to guide our decision-making process and to identify opportunities for improvement. We are committed to using data to continuously monitor and optimize our systems and processes to ensure that we are delivering the best possible outcome for our customers.




How do we work?

Our modelling stack consists of a series of well-stablished Python frameworks such as Scikit Learn/Spacy/Torch/Tensorflow, but we embrace the adoption of new cool tools.

Our backend consists of a series of containerized (Docker) microservices built in Python, and deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.




Our MLOps infrastructure is built upon MLFlow and DVC to track, trace and register the models, the metrics, and the data. We love automatizing things, and our deployments are triggered via Jenkins for the code, and MLFlow for the models. Every service API we build is self-managed, so that you can fine-tune every detail of the serving process.




Our cloud infrastructure runs on Google Cloud. We store data in Redis, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, GCS, and other storage systems. We love kafka, event-based and data-streaming architecture models.




You Will Succeed If:

🚀 You have 4-5 years of solid experience in data science and machine learning.
🧐 You (preferentially) have a degree in computer science, engineering, statistics, mathematics, physics or another degree with a strong quantitative component.
📐You understand the theoretical functioning of the main algorithms in ML and you have experience applying these to real problems.
⚙️ You care about producing maintainable code over time using good programming practices. you have experience in testing and with CI/CD tools.
🌟 Nice to have: you have experience deploying models into production with docker and kubernetes. You are familiar with the MLOps universe.
🛠️ You have ample experience with one or more of these machine learning tools: Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc.
🤔 You are a big-picture thinker who can see the forest and the trees. You have a strong understanding of the technical and business requirements of the projects you work on, and you can think strategically to ensure that your work aligns with the goals of the company.
