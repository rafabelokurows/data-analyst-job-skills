Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, and India.


Please only apply to one opening. If you are a better fit for another opening, our team will move your application. Candidates who apply to multiple openings will not be considered.**

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Ready to ? Who you are:


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.


Data Science is an integral component of Coinbase’s product and decision making process: we work in partnership with Product, Engineering and Design to influence the roadmap and better understand our users. With a deep expertise in experimentation, analytics and advanced modeling, we produce insights which directly move the company’s bottom line.

What You'll Be Doing


Perform analyses on products to answer open-ended questions and provide strategic recommendations.
Design and guide experiments/analysis to measure impact and drive product improvements.
Develop and maintain key metrics and reports, enhancing data infrastructure for better analysis.


What We Look For In You


At least a BA/BS in a quantitative field (ex Math, Stats, Physics, or Computer Science) with ≥2+ years of relevant experience.
Experience driving impact for a digital product with an iterative development cycle.
Understanding of statistical concepts and practical experience applying them (in A|B testing, causal inference, ML, etc.).
Experience in data analyses using SQL.
Experience in programming/modeling in Python.
Demonstration of our core cultural values: clear communication, positive energy, continuous learning, and efficient execution.

Bachelors in Computer Science, Math, Physics, or other technical field, MS/PhD a plus
Comfortable with ambiguity and moving pieces - we're growing fast
Ability to communicate your analysis with clarity and precision to both technical and non-technical teams

Experience with Git, code reviews, and coordination frameworks (e.g. Airflow)
Working knowledge of at least one modeling framework (e.g. scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
Experience with short, medium, and long-term forecasts to understand the likely growth trajectory of our company



Every Snowflake employee is expected to follow the company’s confidentiality and security standards for handling sensitive data.

We’re a next-generation financial services company and national bank using innovative, mobile-first technology to help our millions of members reach their goals. The industry is going through an unprecedented transformation, and we’re at the forefront. We’re proud to come to work every day knowing that what we do has a direct impact on people’s lives, with our core values guiding us every step of the way. Join us to invest in yourself, your career, and the financial world.

The Role

We are seeking a full stack Senior Data Scientist who will help shape business strategy and product development decisions through data-driven insights. This is an exciting role for someone to make a direct impact on new product strategy and revenue of SoFi, supporting SoFi’s B2B business channel called SoFi At Work. The goal of this platform is to provide new ways for our partners to help their employees get their money right across every life stage.

Success in this role hinges on your technical aptitude, quantitative abilities, and business acumen: you know how to plow through data with SQL/Python/R/Tableau, surface insights using math/statistics/ML techniques, and measure the business impact using efficiency/conversion/profit metrics.

This role

What you’ll do:



Work with amazing product and business managers to identify strategic opportunities, measure KPIs to craft compelling stories, make data-driven recommendations, and drive informed actions.

Own end-to-end product analytics workflow including formulating success metrics, socializing them across the organization, and creating dashboards/reports.
Act as a curator of data by defining, instrumenting, and tracking necessary analytics of our products by working cross functionally with engineering and product teams.
Build self-service systems to enable others in the organization to leverage your work.
Analyze and perform statistical analysis on data that underlies product experiments.
Build models to help decision makers understand customer behaviors and segmentation
You stay focused on what’s best for the company – sometimes that requires being flexible, other times it requires being steadfast.



What you’ll need:



Bachelor’s degree required (Masters preferred) in Computer Science, Math, Physics, Engineering or quantitative field.
4+ years of relevant work experience
Intellectual curiosity and aptitude to pick up new technical skills
Exceptional problem-solving skills

You will work closely with the Portfolio Manager on how your analysis could impact their universe and ultimately PnL.




It’s a given this role has technical elements but equally as important is the ability to communicate your analysis and really look to monetize that. As they look to monetize the data, creativity surrounding the data and analysis is very much encouraged. They need someone who enjoys the technical elements but also wants to combine them with the fundamentals of working close to the markets.




As a senior hire you will lead the most impactful projects, you will also play a part in mentoring some of the junior team members.

Build self-service systems to enable others in the organization to leverage your work.
Analyze and perform statistical analysis on data that underlies product experiments.
Build models to help decision makers understand customer behaviors and segmentation
You stay focused on what’s best for the company – sometimes that requires being flexible, other times it requires being steadfast.

What you will do & what we offer

The mission of Scibids is to provide media buyers with fully automated buying strategies for display campaigns, leading to uncompared performances for a minimum of human work.

As a DataScientist, your role will be to evaluate and improve ""Scibids DoubleVerify"" bidding algorithms, which are Scibids main asset, and to actively participate into Scibids automation and development process: each business case not yet automatically handled by our product should be met by the corresponding product improvement. This position will combine analytical rigor, a relentless curiosity, a strong knowledge of statistical methods and experience in implementing them.

This position will combine high development standards, a relentless curiosity, a strong understanding of business priorities and the ambition for your work to become a real game changer!

On a day to day basis, your responsibilities will include:


working with massive datasets (billions of ads impressions/month) and millions of variables.
solving non-routine analysis problems (not handled by off-the-shelf ML solvers).


solving challenging scaling/engineering problems as our system produces thousands of ML models per day.


working closely with the commercial and customer success team and help identify the business cases where a new algorithm is needed/existing ones need improvement.
identify and automate any repetitive process taking place at Scibids, including cases where this means developing some AI routines replacing “human common sense”.


Qualifications

Minimum qualifications:


MS degree in applied mathematics (e.g., statistics, probabilities, operations research, machine learning).
Work / academic projects experience in data analysis or related field (e.g., as a statistician/data scientist) with actual algorithms implementation in an industry programming language (eg Python, C++...)


Preferred Qualifications


Professional/academic experience in a SQL-like language.


Technical stack relevant to the position


Python
SQL
Kubernetes, Docker, Github
Google Cloud Environment, App Engine Standard, Cloud SQL, Google Cloud Datastore...


Cultural fit


Do things only once. No repetitive task survives ingenuity and automation: at Scibids, everything needs to scale!
Base your decisions on data points. Preconceived personal convictions rarely survive thorough confrontation with actual data.
Work in a team and be curious. Every Scibids member has stock-options and is focused on the same objective: make Scibids the next adtech unicorn! This means being interested in how one’s daily personal work fits in Scibids general strategy and having in mind the greater good of the company rather than individual accomplishments.
Have a good laugh. We are a young, hard-working team with huge ambitions: nothing wipes off long hours of work better than sharing a drink with the team!


Others


Contract type: full-time position (French “CDI”).
Based in Paris (75008) – Champs-Elysées
Preferred availability: ASAP
Compensation: competitive package including fix salary.
Exact figures depend on profile.
