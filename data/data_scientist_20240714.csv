About the New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt, the best place to order groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, and other retail goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!) 🚀

About The New Verticals Analytics Team

Our New Verticals Analytics team sits at the intersection of product development, strategic planning, and operational execution. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design, and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions, to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience that combines scientific expertise with stakeholder engagement. When you join this team, you will be taking ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from the ground up, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we want you on our team.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
4+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis using statistical software packages in Python or R.
Expertise in causal inference (Diff in Diff, Synthetic control).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

We have received over $20M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Software Engineer for Machine Learning (d/f/m) at Aignostics, you work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art of machine learning for digital pathology. You will develop distributed software systems for machine learning applications that will help to improve cancer research and diagnostics. Together with your colleagues you will take care of the machine learning software stack and thereby enable our teams to build medical grade quality and scalable machine learning models.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees.

About the Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has got Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Develop and automate forecasting models to plan the capacity of the support centers across different locations.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track scheduling efficiency, occupancy rates, and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building forecasting models & time series analysis (Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters or similar).

You know what it takes to scale Data Science as a function, take exceptional care of exceptional people, and above all: take our Data Science to the next level by also working hands-on owning Machine Learning and AI use cases as part of that team. You'll be a facilitator and an enabler for the team to do what they do best by making personal development plans, hosting regular 1on1s, and so forth. You’ll work directly with senior stakeholders to set the data science vision and direction for the group, executing and implementing DS/ML projects end to end.

We’ll be looking for you to facilitate the future of Data Science at Wolt, whether that’s hiring new team members, levelling up Data Science across the company, or helping the organization to understand the possibilities of Data Science, Machine Learning and AI.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Berlin, Helsinki, or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Germany and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here.

You have experience with real-time applications and large scale deployments, and can handle the entire life cycle of data science solutions from ideation to maintenance;
We would also like you to have strong experience in leading a technical Data Science team to make sure we keep on improving our DS best practices at Wolt while taking care of our people;
You have previous experience from making personal development plans, hosting regular 1on1s, and taking part in recruitment;
Deep understanding and experience with Machine Learning and AI, a solid understanding of Statistics, and experience and knowledge in NLP. Experience in working as a part of an engineering team, building solutions to complex problems with large scale and real-time requirements.
Interest towards LLMs and GenAI and their applications to solving problems in production.
You’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organization, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. We value experience in working with senior stakeholders to set the team vision and direction.
Lastly, as this is a team effort you have to be a strong cultural leader that cares for the well-being and constant improvement of your team members and represents Wolt values as your daily work.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

We are looking for a Software or Data Engineer experienced with high performance Python data processing libraries (Composable Data Stack) to collaborate directly with our CTO and the product team.

dlt is an open-source library that automatically creates datasets from messy, unstructured data sources. You can use the library to move data from about anywhere into the most well-known SQL and vector stores, data lakes, storage buckets, or local engines like DuckDB, Arrow or delta-rs.. It automates many cumbersome data engineering tasks and can be handled by anyone who knows Python. More details in this Hacker News article.

dltHub is based in Berlin and New York City. It was founded by data and machine learning veterans. We are backed by Foundation Capital, Dig Venture, and many technical founders from companies such as Hugging Face, Instana, Matillion, Miro, and Rasa.

Your Tasks and Responsibilities:

dlt is a missing part of composable data stack: a gateway that creates datasets which the other components can then process. Our mission is to integrate dlt fully with this new, emerging ecosystem in a way that our users love. This means we respect their time, effort and previous investments in modern data stack when designing features.


You design and implement OSS features that make dlt a gateway to composable data stack: integrating query engines, transformation frameworks, table formats with our library
You listen to our users, always paying attention to what they need to go to production with dlt
You work with our customers in commercial projects where dlt is combined with existing “modern data stack” infrastructure
You maintain the open source project with the team (e.g., review PRs, resolve issues, talk with community contributors, etc.)


Requirements

Who You Are

If you are fascinated by the emerging ecosystem of data libraries in Python, which allows you to do on a single machine what until recently was possibly only in the cloud - you’ll enjoy working with us.


You know what duckdb, arrow, datafusion, lancedb, delta-rs, ibis, pyiceberg, sqlglot, kedro, hamilton and similar Python libraries / pip installable components do and know when to apply them
You have experience in building data apps or product based on composable data stack
… or you were contributing code to any (or similar) of projects above
You know what so called “modern data stack” is and appreciate certain aspects of it (ie. maturity, fitting into enterprise workflows etc.)
… and in fact you are interested in combining both worlds
You really like Python and are fluent in writing Python code (e.g., Python typing, unit testing, writing docstrings, etc.)
You have a degree in computer science, data science, or other equivalent experience
You are familiar with GitHub workflows (e.g., pull requests, code reviews, CI/CD services, etc.)


Nice to Have:


You are based in Berlin and willing to work in our office regularly
You have a hacker nature and you love to make things optimized
Experience with DevOps (e.g., CI systems like GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP/Digital Ocean, etc.)
Experience with machine learning (e.g., the toolset, the workflows, practical applications, etc.)


Benefits

What do we offer

In our work culture, we value each other’s autonomy and efficiency. We have set hours for communication and deep work. We like automation, so we automate our work before we automate the work of others.


We are an office-first company but give you plenty of opportunities for deep work and work from home. Dedicated ""no meeting days"" to help the team focus on their most impactful work
As we work often from the Berlin office, we cover your public transportation ticket
We are deeply committed to your personal and professional growth, so we have an annual budget for learning and development
We offer regular subsidized team lunches and Urban Sports Club membership
We also have an ESOP plan for employees, depending on their role and dedication. We provide an option to increase your ESOP if you grow with us.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That’s where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $20M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Senior Data Scientist in Aignostic's foundation model team you will work on our self-supervised base models. Together with collaborators in academia and industry you will push the state of the art in large-scale machine learning for digital pathology. Within our team of experts on large-scale machine learning and data handling, you will work on improving, benchmarking and extending our family of best-in-class foundations models, bridging image, text and other pathology data modalities. Moreover, using our foundation models you will contribute to developing prototypes for new applications to assist pathologists and generate new insights for improving cancer treatment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

We are looking for a Software or Data Engineer experienced with high performance Python data processing libraries (Composable Data Stack) to collaborate directly with our CTO and the product team.

dlt is an open-source library that automatically creates datasets from messy, unstructured data sources. You can use the library to move data from about anywhere into the most well-known SQL and vector stores, data lakes, storage buckets, or local engines like DuckDB, Arrow or delta-rs.. It automates many cumbersome data engineering tasks and can be handled by anyone who knows Python. More details in this Hacker News article.

dltHub is based in Berlin and New York City. It was founded by data and machine learning veterans. We are backed by Foundation Capital, Dig Venture, and many technical founders from companies such as Hugging Face, Instana, Matillion, Miro, and Rasa.

Your Tasks and Responsibilities:

dlt is a missing part of composable data stack: a gateway that creates datasets which the other components can then process. Our mission is to integrate dlt fully with this new, emerging ecosystem in a way that our users love. This means we respect their time, effort and previous investments in modern data stack when designing features.


You design and implement OSS features that make dlt a gateway to composable data stack: integrating query engines, transformation frameworks, table formats with our library
You listen to our users, always paying attention to what they need to go to production with dlt
You work with our customers in commercial projects where dlt is combined with existing “modern data stack” infrastructure
You maintain the open source project with the team (e.g., review PRs, resolve issues, talk with community contributors, etc.)


Requirements

Who You Are

If you are fascinated by the emerging ecosystem of data libraries in Python, which allows you to do on a single machine what until recently was possibly only in the cloud - you’ll enjoy working with us.


You know what duckdb, arrow, datafusion, lancedb, delta-rs, ibis, pyiceberg, sqlglot, kedro, hamilton and similar Python libraries / pip installable components do and know when to apply them
You have experience in building data apps or product based on composable data stack
… or you were contributing code to any (or similar) of projects above
You know what so called “modern data stack” is and appreciate certain aspects of it (ie. maturity, fitting into enterprise workflows etc.)
… and in fact you are interested in combining both worlds
You really like Python and are fluent in writing Python code (e.g., Python typing, unit testing, writing docstrings, etc.)
You have a degree in computer science, data science, or other equivalent experience
You are familiar with GitHub workflows (e.g., pull requests, code reviews, CI/CD services, etc.)


Nice to Have:


You are based in Berlin and willing to work in our office regularly
You have a hacker nature and you love to make things optimized
Experience with DevOps (e.g., CI systems like GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP/Digital Ocean, etc.)
Experience with machine learning (e.g., the toolset, the workflows, practical applications, etc.)


Benefits

What do we offer

In our work culture, we value each other’s autonomy and efficiency. We have set hours for communication and deep work. We like automation, so we automate our work before we automate the work of others.


We are an office-first company but give you plenty of opportunities for deep work and work from home. Dedicated ""no meeting days"" to help the team focus on their most impactful work
As we work often from the Berlin office, we cover your public transportation ticket
We are deeply committed to your personal and professional growth, so we have an annual budget for learning and development
We offer regular subsidized team lunches and Urban Sports Club membership
We also have an ESOP plan for employees, depending on their role and dedication. We provide an option to increase your ESOP if you grow with us.

About The Role

At Tesco, our Data Science team focuses on modelling complex business problems and deploying data products at scale. Our work spans across multiple areas including physical stores, online, supply chain, marketing and Clubcard, where we encourage rotation amongst our Data Scientists so they can gain expertise in different subjects.

We work on several domains and problem types: online, pricing, security, fulfilment, distribution, property, and computer vision are just some. Our team members spend 10% of their week on learning and personal development. Multiple academic collaborations enrich the team expertise; knowledge sharing events are regular. Furthermore, we have a great work-life balance, team days and relaxed but engaging culture.

You will be responsible for

This is a hands-on position where you will need to leverage your analytical mindset to find solutions to complex problems. As a Data Scientist, you will need to understand difficult business problems and prototype solutions with minimal support. Apply, modify and design algorithms and mathematical models to solve business problems on top of big data architectures (Hadoop, Spark) is a core component of the role. Our data scientists will need to be able to validate, document and present the modeling process and performances, as well as communicate complex solutions in a clear, understandable way to non-experts. Data Scientists are also responsible for promoting data science across Tesco and promote Tesco across the external Data Science community.

You will need

We are looking for ambitious individuals with a mix of statistics, programming and machine learning skills. The role requires that you have an extensive background in machine learning and data mining. A track record in modifying and designing advanced algorithms and applying them to large data sets is essential.

An ideal candidate will have a scientific mentality with the ability to ask the right questions, as well as answer them. A strong numerical higher degree in a mathematical, scientific, engineering or computer science discipline is preferable, as well as a solid understanding of mathematics and statistical principles.

Experience in one or more of the following fields is required: predictive modelling, operational research, deep learning and time series modelling. Finally, strong programming experience (Python is preferred).

Every Cure is a start-up, nonprofit drug development organization on a mission to alleviate suffering for the ~300 million people worldwide battling diseases without FDA-approved treatments by unlocking hidden cures. We are building a first-of-its-kind, AI-powered platform to identify FDA-approved treatments that can be repurposed for untreated diseases. Inspired by our success in repurposing over a dozen drugs for new uses, including one that is saving Dr. David Fajgenbaum's own life, we are committed to unlocking the full potential of FDA-approved drugs to treat every disease and patient possible.

Our groundbreaking approach revolves around building an open-source database and employing cutting-edge tools to identify drug repurposing opportunities. Since launching at the 2022 Clinton Global Initiative, we have received tremendous media attention and recognition including the 2023 Elevate Prize Foundation Founder’s Award, attracted leaders from across industries, been invited to share about our work at the White House, Aspen Ideas, and a Congressional Caucus Briefing, and demonstrated the life-saving potential of our platform.

Four Strategic Pillars Guide Our Efforts


Using an AI engine to identify promising drug repurposing opportunities.
Prioritizing high-impact opportunities which affect neglected patient communities.
Efficiently validating promising opportunities through laboratory and clinical studies.
Ensuring everyone has equitable access to new cures.


As a nonprofit organization, we are able to focus on maximizing patient impact and saving lives without needing to consider the commercial viability of drugs, including the 80% that are already generic and completely neglected. Our team, comprising experts in drug discovery, data analysis, and clinical trials, collaborates with entities ranging from philanthropic organizations to biopharmaceutical industries including Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Flagship Pioneering, Clinton Global Initiative, Elevate Prize Foundation, and Lyda Hill Philanthropies, among others.

The Every Cure team is expanding rapidly and seeking top-notch, purpose-driven professionals to perform a range of tasks to save lives with hidden cures. This is a unique opportunity to join a highly motivated, patient-focused team based in Philadelphia, PA and New York City that works closely with international collaborators, government agencies, academic researchers, philanthropic organizations, and biopharmaceutical companies to make a significant impact on patients with major unmet medical needs.

Bays is a small data science consultancy that revels in data science and statistics, predictive analytics and forecasting, machine learning and data visualisation. We use maths, not magic, to deliver explainable solutions to customers’ problems.

Bays’ mission is to build a better future using maths, not magic, and our vision is to have a world where all lives are positively impacted by maths. We really are a company that likes maths and statistics. Our values that underpin how we work and explain the company ethos are: People first – It’s nice to be nice – Be true to our word. These really do explain our company and we’re looking for people who would like to work in that type of environment.

Bays Consulting has a small office in Guildford, but all our team members are hybrid workers. You can come into the office as often, or as little, as you would like, and we have team members across the UK – we’re certainly not all based in London. All team members have access to hot desking so you can get out of your home if you don’t want to work there all the time but can’t get to the main office.

We offer a generous holiday package as well as company shut down over Christmas. Bays also has a flexible hour working policy, allowing you to balance life, any caring commitments and work. We’re proud members of both the Living Wage Foundation and Silver Members of the Armed Forces Covenant.

We hope you want to apply for the role, but due to the work we do we need all of our team members to be based in and have the right to work in the UK, provide 2 successful references and pass Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS) screening.

If you’ve got any questions before you apply and want to talk through the role or see what it’s like to work here, email info@baysconsulting.co.uk with “I’d like to learn more about being a data scientist at your company” in the title.




The Role

We are looking for a proactive and maths-loving graduate statistician/data to join our small technical team.  As Bays is small, we’re looking for someone who can apply a wide range of statistical and mathematical analysis skills across all our project areas – from consultancy through to our award-winning service, Bays Crowd. You could be using your skills to research the solution, turn ideas into coded algorithms and explain the solutions to our clients. It's important to remember that as a small consultancy all team members are involved in supporting the end-to-end project delivery, Whilst this role’s focus is on data science, you will be working with every member of the team. In return Bays will give you exposure to the full breadth of the projects we work on giving you the opportunity to work on projects which have a high impact on our business.




The salary band for this role is up to £30,000 (FTE) depending on experience and skill set. We're advertising this as a full-time role but welcome part-time applications. 







Key responsibilities

Working as part of the technical team by undertaking data acquisition and data cleaning to ensure that data is ready for use. That is, you need to like maths.

Working as part of the technical team to research and develop ideas on how to solve the projects we work on. Another reason why you need to like maths.

Working with our data engineers to creating customer-facing tools to incorporate the ideas, methodologies and techniques you’ve developed. Bits of maths here too.... 

Ensuring good design and code quality, including encouraging colleagues in best practices of unit testing. 

 

Essential Skills and Qualities

Without these, you would struggle to thrive in the job.

Strong expertise in computer science, mathematics or technology related field (gained through a degree or substantial work experience) We ask for this as you'll be working in an analytical team

Coding within Python

Willingness to present to clients and customers about the insights and results from the projects you’ve worked on




Helpful skills and qualities

If not already competent, the successful candidate would need to show willingness and aptitude to upskill themselves on the job in the following areas:

Coding using libraries such as Pytorch, TensorFlow and Plot.ly

Cloud based environments (we work in AWS)

Knowledge of agile methodologies




Bonus skills and competencies

You may not have even head of these right now, but we'd be interested to know if you have:

Continuous Integration / Continuous Development (CI/CD)




How to apply

Please either apply through LinkedIN or by sending a cover letter and CV to info@baysconsulting.co.uk

Our vision is fast technology, fair service, and honest values. All at the tap of a phone, all the time.

We are about giving customers a new way to spend, save and manage their money while taking better care of the planet which has seen us become a multi-award winning bank that now employs over 2800 across five offices in London, Cardiff, Dublin, Southampton, and Manchester. Our journey started in 2014, and since then we have surpassed 3.5 million accounts (and four account types!) with 350,000 business customers. We are a fully licensed UK bank but at the heart, we are a tech first company, enabling our platform to deliver brilliant products.

Our technologists are at the very heart of Starling and enjoy working in a fast-paced environment that is all about building things, creating new stuff, and disruptive technology that keeps us on the cutting edge of fintech. We operate a flat structure to empower you to make decisions regardless of what your primary responsibilities may be, innovation and collaboration will be at the core of everything you do. Help is never far away in our open culture, you will find support in your team and from across the business, we are in this together!

The way to thrive and shine within Starling is to be a self-driven individual and be able to take full ownership of everything around you: From building things, designing, discovering, to sharing knowledge with your colleagues and making sure all processes are efficient and productive to deliver the best possible results for our customers. Our purpose is underpinned by five Starling values: Listen, Keep It Simple, Do The Right Thing, Own It, and Aim For Greatness.

Hybrid Working

We have a Hybrid approach to working here at Starling - our preference is that you're located within a commutable distance of one of our offices so that we're able to interact and collaborate in person. We don't like to mandate how much you visit the office and work from home, that's to be agreed upon between you and your manager.

We are looking for Data Scientists with experience working in Marketing to help the bank solve complex problems using Machine Learning. In this role, you'll use your skills and passion for data to understand our customers and drive growth through effective marketing strategies.

Responsibilites:

Develop and refine models to predict customer lifetime value (LTV) to optimise marketing investments and resource allocation.
Analyse customer behaviour and product usage data to identify target audiences and tailor marketing efforts for maximum impact.
Employ causal models to evaluate the effectiveness of CRM and invite campaigns and use causal inference to personalise campaigns for individual users.
Contribute to building and interpreting Marketing Mix Models (MMM) to understand the best growth activities.
Collaborate with Data Analysts to ensure they effectively utilise the models you build.



Requirements



We're open-minded when it comes to hiring and we care more about aptitude and attitude than specific experience or qualifications. We think the ideal candidate will encompass most of the following:

Solid understanding of customer lifetime value (LTV) modelling and marketing mix modelling.
Deep understanding of statistics, especially Bayesian reasoning, and the ability to assess the accuracy of your results.
Experience with causal inference concepts and machine learning models for causal inference.
Comfortable with a variety of modelling techniques, including gradient boosting, neural networks, linear regression, and blending these approaches.
Expert in Python with the ability to make well-reasoned design decisions in your code.
Comfortable working with external data sources through APIs.
Ability to see the bigger picture of business processes and clearly define how models can be integrated and add value.
Excellent communication and visualisation skills to effectively present your findings to different audiences.

Interview Process

Interviewing is a two way process and we want you to have the time and opportunity to get to know us, as much as we are getting to know you! Our interviews are conversational and we want to get the best from you, so come with questions and be curious. In general you can expect the below, following a chat with one of our Talent Team:

Stage 1 - 45 mins with one of the team
Stage 2 - Take home test
Stage 3 - 60 mins technical interview with two team members
Stage 4 - 45 min final with an executive and a member of the people team

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do<br><br>We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.<br><br>Who you are<br><br>We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.<br><br><strong>Minimum Requirements<br><br></strong><ul><li>2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience</li><li>Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R </li><li>Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation</li><li>Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results</li><li>Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact</li><li>A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail</li><li>Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations</li><li>A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom<br><br><br></li></ul><strong>Preferred Qualifications<br><br></strong><ul><li>Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance</li><li>Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs</li><li>Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.</li><li>A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)<br><br><br></li></ul>Hybrid work at Stripe<br><br>This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).<br><br>Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.<br><br>A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office.

This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.<br><br>Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is a global management consulting firm and the world’s leading advisor on business strategy. We partner with clients from the private, public, and not-for-profit sectors in all regions to identify their highest-value opportunities, address their most critical challenges, and transform their enterprises. Our customized approach combines deep insight into the dynamics of companies and markets with close collaboration at all levels of the client organization. This ensures that our clients achieve sustainable competitive advantage, build more capable organizations, and secure lasting results. Founded in 1963, BCG is a private company with offices in more than 90 cities in 50 countries. For more information, please visit bcg.com.

BCG’s clients are the world’s top business leaders. From computers to retailing, our professional expertise spans over 50 industries. The vast majority of our clients rank among the 500 largest companies in each of our three major regions–Americas (North and South), Europe Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Additionally, we work with a number of small- to medium-sized companies, both public and private.

The success of our assignments routinely leads our clients to maintain long-term relationships with us. Over 85 percent of our revenues come from clients who continue to work with us from one year to the next to maintain the momentum for change and to continually improve bottom-line results they have achieved with our help.

We pride ourselves on our fresh thinking. Our evolving ideas profoundly change the way most businesses think about competition. Many leading business concepts over the past three decades originated with BCG–including, experience curve, time-based competition, Segment-of-One® marketing, deconstruction, and trading up. Our recent Collateral Damage publication series has addressed the implications for managers of the on-going financial crisis.

We believe that no other consulting organization has concentrated as thoroughly on understanding business competition and helping companies make the changes necessary to succeed in increasingly competitive markets.

La réputation mondiale du cabinet de conseil en gestion Boston Consulting Group (BCG), comme l'un des meilleurs en gestion, découle de plus de cinquante années d'expérience à aider les cadres supérieurs à découvrir et réaliser tout le potentiel de leur entreprise. Notre mission consiste à appuyer nos clients à réaliser des avantages concurrentiels durables en offrant des solutions personnalisées. Nous croyons fermement qu'il faut travailler avec nos clients, pas à leurs dépens. Nous collaborons avec chaque client pour l'aider à prendre une direction et à faire face aux défis organisationnels et opérationnels.

Fondé en 1963, BCG compte maintenant plus de 11,000 experts-conseils, et ce, dans plus de 90 bureaux dans le monde entier. Les clients du BCG sont les dirigeants des plus importantes entreprises du monde. Des ordinateurs jusqu'à la vente au détail, notre expertise professionnelle s'étend à plus de 50 industries. La grande majorité de nos clients figurent parmi les 500 plus grandes entreprises dans chacune de nos trois régions principales – Les Amériques (nord et sud), l'Europe (incluant le Moyen-Orient et l'Afrique) et l'Asie-Pacifique. De plus, nous travaillons avec un certain nombre de petites et moyennes entreprises, tant publiques que privées.

Notre succès, provenant des mandats qui nous sont assignés, nous permet d'établir des relations à long terme avec nos clients. Plus de 85 pourcents de nos revenus proviennent de clients qui continuent à travailler avec nous d'une année à l'autre pour conserver l'élan de changement et pour améliorer continuellement les résultats nets qu'ils ont réalisés grâce à notre aide.

Nous sommes fiers de notre approche innovatrice. Nos idées évolutives changent profondément la manière dont la plupart des entreprises considèrent la concurrence. Plusieurs des principaux concepts d'affaires, au cours des trois dernières décennies, ont commencé avec BCG, y compris la courbe d'apprentissage, la concurrence calculée sur le temps, le marketing Segment-of-One®, le démantèlement et l'extension ascendante. Nos récentes publications de la série Collateral Damage ont traité de l'implication des dirigeants face à la crise financière en cours.

Nous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.

Plus de 85 pourcents de nos revenus proviennent de clients qui continuent à travailler avec nous d'une année à l'autre pour conserver l'élan de changement et pour améliorer continuellement les résultats nets qu'ils ont réalisés grâce à notre aide.

Nous sommes fiers de notre approche innovatrice. Nos idées évolutives changent profondément la manière dont la plupart des entreprises considèrent la concurrence. Plusieurs des principaux concepts d'affaires, au cours des trois dernières décennies, ont commencé avec BCG, y compris la courbe d'apprentissage, la concurrence calculée sur le temps, le marketing Segment-of-One®, le démantèlement et l'extension ascendante. Nos récentes publications de la série Collateral Damage ont traité de l'implication des dirigeants face à la crise financière en cours.

Nous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.

Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is a global management consulting firm and the world’s leading advisor on business strategy. We partner with clients from the private, public, and not-for-profit sectors in all regions to identify their highest-value opportunities, address their most critical challenges, and transform their enterprises. Our customized approach combines deep insight into the dynamics of companies and markets with close collaboration at all levels of the client organization. This ensures that our clients achieve sustainable competitive advantage, build more capable organizations, and secure lasting results. Founded in 1963, BCG is a private company with offices in more than 90 cities in 50 countries. For more information, please visit bcg.com.

BCG’s clients are the world’s top business leaders. From computers to retailing, our professional expertise spans over 50 industries. The vast majority of our clients rank among the 500 largest companies in each of our three major regions–Americas (North and South), Europe Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Additionally, we work with a number of small- to medium-sized companies, both public and private.

The success of our assignments routinely leads our clients to maintain long-term relationships with us. Over 85 percent of our revenues come from clients who continue to work with us from one year to the next to maintain the momentum for change and to continually improve bottom-line results they have achieved with our help.

We pride ourselves on our fresh thinking. Our evolving ideas profoundly change the way most businesses think about competition. Many leading business concepts over the past three decades originated with BCG–including, experience curve, time-based competition, Segment-of-One® marketing, deconstruction, and trading up. Our recent Collateral Damage publication series has addressed the implications for managers of the on-going financial crisis.

We believe that no other consulting organization has concentrated as thoroughly on understanding business competition and helping companies make the changes necessary to succeed in increasingly competitive markets.

La réputation mondiale du cabinet de conseil en gestion Boston Consulting Group (BCG), comme l'un des meilleurs en gestion, découle de plus de cinquante années d'expérience à aider les cadres supérieurs à découvrir et réaliser tout le potentiel de leur entreprise. Notre mission consiste à appuyer nos clients à réaliser des avantages concurrentiels durables en offrant des solutions personnalisées. Nous croyons fermement qu'il faut travailler avec nos clients, pas à leurs dépens. Nous collaborons avec chaque client pour l'aider à prendre une direction et à faire face aux défis organisationnels et opérationnels.

Fondé en 1963, BCG compte maintenant plus de 11,000 experts-conseils, et ce, dans plus de 90 bureaux dans le monde entier. Les clients du BCG sont les dirigeants des plus importantes entreprises du monde. Des ordinateurs jusqu'à la vente au détail, notre expertise professionnelle s'étend à plus de 50 industries. La grande majorité de nos clients figurent parmi les 500 plus grandes entreprises dans chacune de nos trois régions principales – Les Amériques (nord et sud), l'Europe (incluant le Moyen-Orient et l'Afrique) et l'Asie-Pacifique.

Notre succès, provenant des mandats qui nous sont assignés, nous permet d'établir des relations à long terme avec nos clients.

Plusieurs des principaux concepts d'affaires, au cours des trois dernières décennies, ont commencé avec BCG, y compris la courbe d'apprentissage, la concurrence calculée sur le temps, le marketing Segment-of-One®, le démantèlement et l'extension ascendante. Nos récentes publications de la série Collateral Damage ont traité de l'implication des dirigeants face à la crise financière en cours.

Nous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Machine Learning Infrastructure group at Stripe aims to provide state of the art infrastructure and support for building and operationalizing AI/ML models for all business verticals within the company, including but not limited to models that mitigate risks across Stripe’s products and services globally, and models that help our customers to fight fraud by leveraging Stripe’s user facing products like Radar and Identity. ML is a top priority for Stripe in the coming years. With the phenomenal developments happening in the field of AI, we are positioned to accelerate the adoption of AI/ML across all parts of the company by building highly scalable and reliable foundational infrastructure.

What you’ll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching machine learning models using tools such as XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch.
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly impact Stripe’s top line metrics.
Propose new feature ideas and design data pipelines to incorporate them into our models
Improve the way we evaluate and monitor our model and system performance
Collaborate with stakeholders and drive end-to-end projects involving a variety of technologies and systems to successful completion.



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


At least 5 years of industry experience doing end-to-end ML development on a machine learning team and bringing ML models to production
Advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. computer science, statistics, physics, …)
Proficient in Python, Scala, Spark



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Hands-on applied ML (model training, deployment to production, etc) experience
You keep up-to-date on the latest in AI engineering practices and research
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data
Knowledge about how to manipulate data to perform analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to evaluate a hypothesis.
Experience evaluating niche and upcoming ML solutions



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Payment Intelligence ML organization optimizes each of the billions of dollars of transactions processed by Stripe annually on behalf of our customers, maximizing successful transactions while minimizing payment costs and fraud. We leverage ML to serve real-time predictions as part of Stripe’s payment infrastructure and risk controls. We own products like Radar, Adaptive Acceptance, and Identity end-to-end, operating lightning fast world-scale services and cutting-edge ML models.

What you’ll do

We are looking for Machine Learning Engineers to own the end-to-end lifecycle of applied ML model development and deployment in service of consumer facing products like Radar, Adaptive Acceptance, and Identity. You will work closely with software engineers, machine learning engineers (MLE), data scientists (DS), and ML platform infrastructure teams to design, build, deploy, and operate Stripe’s ML-powered payment decisioning systems, including improving existing ML models and developing new ML solutions.

Responsibilities


Design and deploy new models using tools (such as Spark, Presto, XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch) and iteratively improve verification and fraud models to protect millions of users from fraud
Envision and develop new models for fraud detection i.e work with large payment datasets to find creative new methods of detecting and deterring fraudulent behavior.
Propose new feature ideas and design real-time data pipelines to incorporate them into our models.
Integrate new signals into ML pipelines, derive new ML features, and build workflows to make this process fast
Integrate new models and behaviors into Stripe’s core payment flow
Collaborate and execute projects cross-functionally with the data science, product management, infrastructure, and risk teams
Ensure engineering outcomes meet or exceed established standards of excellence in code quality, system design, and scalability
Mentor engineers earlier in their technical careers to help them grow
Propose and implement innovative product ideas to reduce costs and combat fraud at Stripe



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Over 3+ years industry experience building machine learning applications in large scale distributed systems.
2+ year of experience working within a team responsible for developing, managing, and optimizing ML models or ML infrastructure
Experience designing and training machine learning models to solve critical business problems
Experience performing analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to model performance and business metrics



Preferred Qualifications


An advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. stats, physics, computer science)
Proven track record of building and deploying machine learning systems that have effectively solved critical business problems
Experience in adversarial domains like Payments, Fraud, Trust, or Safety
Experience working in Python, Java and / or Ruby codebases
Experience in software engineering in a production environment.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $173,100 - $316,800. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Machine Learning Infrastructure group at Stripe aims to provide state of the art infrastructure and support for building and operationalizing AI/ML models for all business verticals within the company, including but not limited to models that mitigate risks across Stripe’s products and services globally, and models that help our customers to fight fraud by leveraging Stripe’s user facing products like Radar and Identity. ML is a top priority for Stripe in the coming years. With the phenomenal developments happening in the field of AI, we are positioned to accelerate the adoption of AI/ML across all parts of the company by building highly scalable and reliable foundational infrastructure.

What you’ll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching machine learning models using tools such as XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch.
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly impact Stripe’s top line metrics.
Propose new feature ideas and design data pipelines to incorporate them into our models
Improve the way we evaluate and monitor our model and system performance
Collaborate with stakeholders and drive end-to-end projects involving a variety of technologies and systems to successful completion.



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


At least 5 years of industry experience doing end-to-end ML development on a machine learning team and bringing ML models to production
Advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. computer science, statistics, physics, …)
Proficient in Python, Scala, Spark

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Payment Intelligence ML organization optimizes each of the billions of dollars of transactions processed by Stripe annually on behalf of our customers, maximizing successful transactions while minimizing payment costs and fraud. We leverage ML to serve real-time predictions as part of Stripe’s payment infrastructure and risk controls. We own products like Radar, Adaptive Acceptance, and Identity end-to-end, operating lightning fast world-scale services and cutting-edge ML models.

What you’ll do

We are looking for Machine Learning Engineers to own the end-to-end lifecycle of applied ML model development and deployment in service of consumer facing products like Radar, Adaptive Acceptance, and Identity. You will work closely with software engineers, machine learning engineers (MLE), data scientists (DS), and ML platform infrastructure teams to design, build, deploy, and operate Stripe’s ML-powered payment decisioning systems, including improving existing ML models and developing new ML solutions.

Responsibilities


Design and deploy new models using tools (such as Spark, Presto, XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch) and iteratively improve verification and fraud models to protect millions of users from fraud
Envision and develop new models for fraud detection i.e work with large payment datasets to find creative new methods of detecting and deterring fraudulent behavior.
Propose new feature ideas and design real-time data pipelines to incorporate them into our models.
Integrate new signals into ML pipelines, derive new ML features, and build workflows to make this process fast
Integrate new models and behaviors into Stripe’s core payment flow
Collaborate and execute projects cross-functionally with the data science, product management, infrastructure, and risk teams
Ensure engineering outcomes meet or exceed established standards of excellence in code quality, system design, and scalability
Mentor engineers earlier in their technical careers to help them grow
Propose and implement innovative product ideas to reduce costs and combat fraud at Stripe



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Over 3+ years industry experience building machine learning applications in large scale distributed systems.
2+ year of experience working within a team responsible for developing, managing, and optimizing ML models or ML infrastructure
Experience designing and training machine learning models to solve critical business problems
Experience performing analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to model performance and business metrics



Preferred Qualifications


An advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. stats, physics, computer science)
Proven track record of building and deploying machine learning systems that have effectively solved critical business problems
Experience in adversarial domains like Payments, Fraud, Trust, or Safety
Experience working in Python, Java and / or Ruby codebases
Experience in software engineering in a production environment.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $173,100 - $316,800. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Industrial Light & Magic, founded in 1975 by George Lucas, has created some of the most iconic moments in motion picture history. From Star Wars to Jurassic Park, Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers, The Avengers, theme park rides and interactive experiences, ILM continues to expand the possibilities of what visual entertainment can be.

ILM’s Research and Development (R&D) group develops the ground-breaking technology that empowers our artists to create dazzling visuals. ILM’s innovations have won 34 Scientific and Technical Academy Awards®. Today, we are 70+ visually-minded software engineers, working side-by-side with over a thousand digital artists in a fast-paced, intensely collaborative, creative film production environment, across studios in San Francisco, Vancouver, London, Sydney, and Mumbai.

Summary of the Role:

This role is considered Hybrid, which means the employee will work 2-3 days onsite at a Company designated location and occasionally from home.

We seek engineers to join our R&D team and help us develop tools and production techniques across all areas of visual effects and feature animation production:



Image processing, compositing, and rotoscoping, including depth estimation, image segmentation, generative in-painting, and plate relighting.
Simulating natural phenomena, rigid-body destruction, crowds and procedural animation.
Lighting, texturing, look-development, and layered material definition.
Modeling, rigging, and animation of bodies and faces, including soft-body dynamic simulation of cloth, hair, and flesh.
Tools, structures, and pipeline systems that define how artists assemble and manage massively complex 3D scenes, and user interfaces for authoring, validating, publishing, and tracking 3D and 2D data as it moves through a network of automated batch processes.



We welcome engineers with a passion for applying the latest machine learning technology to these challenges and more!

At ILM, a good idea is a good idea, regardless of where it comes from! Do you thrive in a creative environment? Do you enjoy sharing knowledge and learning from others? If you love art, technology, and movies, then this might be the role you’re looking for.

ILM strives to be an inclusive environment, and the R&D group in particular embraces promising individuals with a variety backgrounds and experiences.

What You’ll Do:



A little bit of everything! Develop innovative algorithms, craft artist-friendly user interfaces, optimize data management processes, and build special purpose content creation tools that handle large-scale photo-realistic visual effects production. Occasionally, you might work on shots alongside artists. You’ll have an opportunity to lead teams and projects and influence our development where appropriate.
Work with engineers across all ILM’s studios, splitting time between long-term software development projects and day-to-day artist support, consultation, and problem-solving.
Collaborate with commercial software vendors in developing and deploying the next generation of machine-learning-based tools wherever applicable.



What to Bring:



Proficiency in C++ and Python on Linux.
Knowledge of and/or eagerness to learn principles of visual effects, potentially with a specialty such as modeling, animation, lighting, rendering, image processing, etc.
Experience with Maya, Houdini, Katana, Mari or other commercial software applications is helpful, but a readiness to learn works as well.
Experience with machine learning techniques, processes, and toolsets.
Working knowledge of standard data formats: OpenEXR, OpenVDB, Alembic, USD, etc.
Enthusiasm for designing artist-friendly interfaces using GUI toolkits: Qt, PySide, QML, etc. You don’t need to be a professional UX designer, but you should have a keen sense for how creative people use technology to work together in production.
Appreciation of software development principles: object-oriented design, test-driven development, source code management, build and release processes.



Education / Experience:



BS and/or advanced degree in computer science or related field, or similar experience.
Typically 2+ years or demonstrated experience with professional software development and/or VFX production.

We build machine learning services and data pipelines to automatically extract insights about competitors from both public and internal data sources. Every day, our services process millions of data points, including news articles, press releases, webpage changes, Slack posts, emails, reviews, CRM opportunities, and user actions. We utilize a broad array of ML techniques, including classification, clustering, recommendation, summarization, prompt engineering, vector search, and retrieval augmented generation.

Q: Klue who?

A: We’re Klue and from a technical perspective, Klue’s mission is to descale huge amounts of data to the human level, so people can process it and make use of it. Klue is that trusted intermediary, right now it’s proven for sales enablement, but tomorrow it’s all teams enablement.

Q: What level of experience are we looking for?

A: Right now we are looking for senior-level experienced Back-End Engineers with a background in GenAI, LLMs, or NLP-related work.

Q: What is our development team working on?

A: Services for collecting, processing, and generating timely, relevant intel that is accurately linked to competitors, products, industries, and people

As part of our backend team, we are concerned with data storage and retrieval and the infrastructure to enable that. Here’s what our development team is working on and the opportunity for motivated Software Engineers to dig into, alongside us:


Big Data - lots of data
Ingesting hundreds of thousands of news articles, web pages, marketing, and sales data points per day. The challenge is indexing them for a long period of time and making them searchable and ready for different analyses.
Expanding our Rails REST API and offering public APIs to enable integrations.
Architect infrastructure for a scalable, resilient, and robust service. We are migrating from a monolith architecture to K8S-hosted microservices.
Retrieval Augmented Generation for Compete - An end-to-end system that ingests a real-time feed of compete content from various sources such as Slack, reviews, websites, news, interviews, sales calls, and documents, to generate relevant and factually accurate content


Q: What is our current tech stack?

A: Python (Flask), PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, GCP, AWS, Tensorflow, Keras, Docker, Kubernetes.

Transformers, Pytorch, Hugging Face, Spacy, Sklearn, Pinecone, Kubeflow, Vertex AI, BentoML, Temporal, JS, Github, GPT.

We believe in using whatever tools make sense to get the job done and support our game-changing innovation.

Q: Are you HYBRID FRIENDLY 🤩 ?

A: YES! Hybrid. Best of both worlds (remote & in-office)

Our main Canadian hubs are in Vancouver and Toronto, and most of our teams are located in EST and PST.

You and your team will be in office at least 2 days per week.

Q: What skills do you bring?


Expertise in Python
You stay up to date on recent advances with LLMs and are quick to experiment with the latest approaches including RAG
You own initiatives end to end: from prototyping to production
You lead technical design discussions, write and review technical design documents, and provide technical guidance and directions to the larger engineering team
Expertise in relational databases such as PostgreSQL or MySQL
You are proficient in designing, implementing, and deploying RESTful APIs and you have experience with (non)relational and vector databases.
Experience using Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP
You demonstrate good judgment when making architectural decisions and you understand how those decisions fit into the bigger picture
Experience using NoSQL databases such as Elasticsearch or MongoDB is a plus


Q: What motivates our current team right now?


The type of work. Challenging, stimulating and meaningful work. New and relevant tech stack. We know engineers/developers especially want to work on hard technical and innovative problems.
The inspiration from skilled and proven leaders.
Entrepreneurial fingerprints on what will be a future billion dollar company anchored in Canada.
Culture, team, and the work environment.
High degree of autonomy and accountability.
High degrees of transparency and high quality communication.


Q: What are the people at Klue like?


Builders
Intellectually Curious
Ambitious
Objective Oriented
Check us out!


Q: What about total compensation & benefits?


Benefits. We currently have extended health benefits starting on your 1st day.
Time off. Take what you need. We want the team to prioritize wellness and avoid burnout. Vacation usually falls into 3 categories: recharging, life-event, & keeping a work-life balance. Just ensure the required work gets done and clear it with your team in advance. You need to take at least two weeks off every year. The average Klue team member takes 2-4 weeks of PTO per year.


⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️

Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Our team owns the pipelines that transport and process database data from all of Asana’s product surfaces. We build and operate the infrastructure and services that ensure data accuracy and data availability for stakeholders in Data Science, Business, and Product teams.

The Experimentation Platform & Data Tools team splits our time across two areas: analytical data tools, and the Experimentation framework, used to run product A/B tests. We’re a small-but-mighty team that covers a lot of surface area. From distributed data processing with Apache Spark, to full stack web development on the Experimentation UI, to building and maintaining Kubernetes applications, you’ll have the opportunity to wear many hats and create outsized impact.

This role might be for you if you’re agile, scrappy, and interested in learning and mastering a variety of technologies.

This role is based in our Vancouver office with an office-centric hybrid schedule. The standard in-office days are Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Most Asanas have the option to work from home on Wednesdays. Working from home on Fridays depends on the type of work you do and the teams with which you partner. If you're interviewing for this role, your recruiter will share more about the in-office requirements.

What You’ll Achieve


Work on all parts of Asana’s in-house experimentation platform, from product-side logging (Typescript, Scala), to the statistical backend (Apache Spark / Scala), to the user interface (React / Typescript)
Improve our tools for data analytics, visualization, governance, and lineage (e.g. Databricks, Redash, Amundsen, Marquez, etc.)
Build and manage infrastructure using Kubernetes and Terraform
Ensure data availability by participating in an on-call rotation for our team’s services
Develop clean, beautiful code and leave it better than you found it


About You


5+ years of experience working within large, well-maintained codebases
You’re enthusiastic about working on a broad range of technical challenges, from distributed data processing to full-stack web development
You take pride in writing clean code and building performant infrastructure
Experience with Python or Scala
Bonus points if:
You’re interested in A/B testing and conversational in relevant topics like p-values, statistical power, and bias
You take an interest in functional programming languages such as Scala, Haskell, or OCaml

At Asana, we're committed to building teams that include a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, as this is critical to helping us achieve our mission. If you're interested in this role and don't meet every listed requirement, we still encourage you to apply.

What We’ll Offer

Our comprehensive compensation package plays a big part in how we recognize you for the impact you have on our path to achieving our mission. We believe that compensation should be reflective of the value you create relative to the market value of your role. To ensure pay is fair and not impacted by biases, we're committed to looking at market value which is why we check ourselves and conduct a yearly pay equity audit.

For this role, the estimated base salary range is between $176,000 - $224,000. The actual base salary will vary based on various factors, including market and individual qualifications objectively assessed during the interview process. The listed range above is a guideline, and the base salary range for this role may be modified.

In addition to base salary, your compensation package may include additional components such as equity, sales incentive pay (for most sales roles), and benefits. If you're interviewing for this role, speak with your Talent Acquisition Partner to learn more about the total compensation and benefits for this role.

We strive to provide equitable and competitive benefits packages that support our employees worldwide and include:


Mental health, wellness & fitness benefits
Career coaching & support
Inclusive family building benefits
Long-term savings or retirement plans
In-office culinary options to cater to your dietary preferences


These are just some of the benefits we offer, and benefits may vary based on role, country, and local regulations. If you're interviewing for this role, speak with your Talent Acquisition Partner to learn more about the total compensation and benefits for this role.

Industrial Light & Magic, founded in 1975 by George Lucas, has created some of the most iconic moments in motion picture history. From Star Wars to Jurassic Park, Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers, The Avengers, theme park rides and interactive experiences, ILM continues to expand the possibilities of what visual entertainment can be.

ILM’s Research and Development (R&D) group develops the ground-breaking technology that empowers our artists to create dazzling visuals. ILM’s innovations have won 34 Scientific and Technical Academy Awards®. Today, we are 70+ visually-minded software engineers, working side-by-side with over a thousand digital artists in a fast-paced, intensely collaborative, creative film production environment, across studios in San Francisco, Vancouver, London, Sydney, and Mumbai.

Summary of the Role:

This role is considered Hybrid, which means the employee will work 2-3 days onsite at a Company designated location and occasionally from home.

We seek engineers to join our R&D team and help us develop tools and production techniques across all areas of visual effects and feature animation production:



Image processing, compositing, and rotoscoping, including depth estimation, image segmentation, generative in-painting, and plate relighting.
Simulating natural phenomena, rigid-body destruction, crowds and procedural animation.
Lighting, texturing, look-development, and layered material definition.
Modeling, rigging, and animation of bodies and faces, including soft-body dynamic simulation of cloth, hair, and flesh.
Tools, structures, and pipeline systems that define how artists assemble and manage massively complex 3D scenes, and user interfaces for authoring, validating, publishing, and tracking 3D and 2D data as it moves through a network of automated batch processes.



We welcome engineers with a passion for applying the latest machine learning technology to these challenges and more!

At ILM, a good idea is a good idea, regardless of where it comes from! Do you thrive in a creative environment? Do you enjoy sharing knowledge and learning from others? If you love art, technology, and movies, then this might be the role you’re looking for.

ILM strives to be an inclusive environment, and the R&D group in particular embraces promising individuals with a variety backgrounds and experiences.

What You’ll Do:



A little bit of everything! Develop innovative algorithms, craft artist-friendly user interfaces, optimize data management processes, and build special purpose content creation tools that handle large-scale photo-realistic visual effects production. Occasionally, you might work on shots alongside artists. You’ll have an opportunity to lead teams and projects and influence our development where appropriate.
Work with engineers across all ILM’s studios, splitting time between long-term software development projects and day-to-day artist support, consultation, and problem-solving.
Collaborate with commercial software vendors in developing and deploying the next generation of machine-learning-based tools wherever applicable.



What to Bring:



Proficiency in C++ and Python on Linux.
Knowledge of and/or eagerness to learn principles of visual effects, potentially with a specialty such as modeling, animation, lighting, rendering, image processing, etc.
Experience with Maya, Houdini, Katana, Mari or other commercial software applications is helpful, but a readiness to learn works as well.
Experience with machine learning techniques, processes, and toolsets.
Working knowledge of standard data formats: OpenEXR, OpenVDB, Alembic, USD, etc.
Enthusiasm for designing artist-friendly interfaces using GUI toolkits: Qt, PySide, QML, etc. You don’t need to be a professional UX designer, but you should have a keen sense for how creative people use technology to work together in production.
Appreciation of software development principles: object-oriented design, test-driven development, source code management, build and release processes.



Education / Experience:



BS and/or advanced degree in computer science or related field, or similar experience.
Typically 2+ years or demonstrated experience with professional software development and/or VFX production.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture.

You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

We build machine learning services and data pipelines to automatically extract insights about competitors from both public and internal data sources. Every day, our services process millions of data points, including news articles, press releases, webpage changes, Slack posts, emails, reviews, CRM opportunities, and user actions. We utilize a broad array of ML techniques, including classification, clustering, recommendation, summarization, prompt engineering, vector search, and retrieval augmented generation.

Q: Klue who?

A: We’re Klue and from a technical perspective, Klue’s mission is to descale huge amounts of data to the human level, so people can process it and make use of it. Klue is that trusted intermediary, right now it’s proven for sales enablement, but tomorrow it’s all teams enablement.

Q: What level of experience are we looking for?

A: Right now we are looking for senior-level experienced Back-End Engineers with a background in GenAI, LLMs, or NLP-related work.

Q: What is our development team working on?

A: Services for collecting, processing, and generating timely, relevant intel that is accurately linked to competitors, products, industries, and people

As part of our backend team, we are concerned with data storage and retrieval and the infrastructure to enable that. Here’s what our development team is working on and the opportunity for motivated Software Engineers to dig into, alongside us:


Big Data - lots of data
Ingesting hundreds of thousands of news articles, web pages, marketing, and sales data points per day. The challenge is indexing them for a long period of time and making them searchable and ready for different analyses.
Expanding our Rails REST API and offering public APIs to enable integrations.
Architect infrastructure for a scalable, resilient, and robust service. We are migrating from a monolith architecture to K8S-hosted microservices.
Retrieval Augmented Generation for Compete - An end-to-end system that ingests a real-time feed of compete content from various sources such as Slack, reviews, websites, news, interviews, sales calls, and documents, to generate relevant and factually accurate content


Q: What is our current tech stack?

A: Python (Flask), PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, GCP, AWS, Tensorflow, Keras, Docker, Kubernetes.

Transformers, Pytorch, Hugging Face, Spacy, Sklearn, Pinecone, Kubeflow, Vertex AI, BentoML, Temporal, JS, Github, GPT.

We believe in using whatever tools make sense to get the job done and support our game-changing innovation.

Q: Are you HYBRID FRIENDLY 🤩 ?

A: YES! Hybrid. Best of both worlds (remote & in-office)

Our main Canadian hubs are in Vancouver and Toronto, and most of our teams are located in EST and PST.

You and your team will be in office at least 2 days per week.

Q: What skills do you bring?


Expertise in Python
You stay up to date on recent advances with LLMs and are quick to experiment with the latest approaches including RAG
You own initiatives end to end: from prototyping to production
You lead technical design discussions, write and review technical design documents, and provide technical guidance and directions to the larger engineering team
Expertise in relational databases such as PostgreSQL or MySQL
You are proficient in designing, implementing, and deploying RESTful APIs and you have experience with (non)relational and vector databases.
Experience using Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP
You demonstrate good judgment when making architectural decisions and you understand how those decisions fit into the bigger picture
Experience using NoSQL databases such as Elasticsearch or MongoDB is a plus


Q: What motivates our current team right now?


The type of work. Challenging, stimulating and meaningful work. New and relevant tech stack. We know engineers/developers especially want to work on hard technical and innovative problems.
The inspiration from skilled and proven leaders.
Entrepreneurial fingerprints on what will be a future billion dollar company anchored in Canada.
Culture, team, and the work environment.
High degree of autonomy and accountability.
High degrees of transparency and high quality communication.


Q: What are the people at Klue like?


Builders
Intellectually Curious
Ambitious
Objective Oriented
Check us out!


Q: What about total compensation & benefits?


Benefits. We currently have extended health benefits starting on your 1st day.
Time off. Take what you need. We want the team to prioritize wellness and avoid burnout. Vacation usually falls into 3 categories: recharging, life-event, & keeping a work-life balance. Just ensure the required work gets done and clear it with your team in advance. You need to take at least two weeks off every year. The average Klue team member takes 2-4 weeks of PTO per year.


⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️

Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Come take off with us!

The yearly total compensation for this senior position ranges from $150,000 to $350,000 CAD. Compensation will be determined by candidates' relevant qualifications, knowledge, skills and work experience.

Our team owns the pipelines that transport and process database data from all of Asana’s product surfaces. We build and operate the infrastructure and services that ensure data accuracy and data availability for stakeholders in Data Science, Business, and Product teams.

The Experimentation Platform & Data Tools team splits our time across two areas: analytical data tools, and the Experimentation framework, used to run product A/B tests. We’re a small-but-mighty team that covers a lot of surface area. From distributed data processing with Apache Spark, to full stack web development on the Experimentation UI, to building and maintaining Kubernetes applications, you’ll have the opportunity to wear many hats and create outsized impact.

This role might be for you if you’re agile, scrappy, and interested in learning and mastering a variety of technologies.

This role is based in our Vancouver office with an office-centric hybrid schedule. The standard in-office days are Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Most Asanas have the option to work from home on Wednesdays. Working from home on Fridays depends on the type of work you do and the teams with which you partner. If you're interviewing for this role, your recruiter will share more about the in-office requirements.

What You’ll Achieve


Work on all parts of Asana’s in-house experimentation platform, from product-side logging (Typescript, Scala), to the statistical backend (Apache Spark / Scala), to the user interface (React / Typescript)
Improve our tools for data analytics, visualization, governance, and lineage (e.g. Databricks, Redash, Amundsen, Marquez, etc.)
Build and manage infrastructure using Kubernetes and Terraform
Ensure data availability by participating in an on-call rotation for our team’s services
Develop clean, beautiful code and leave it better than you found it


About You


5+ years of experience working within large, well-maintained codebases
You’re enthusiastic about working on a broad range of technical challenges, from distributed data processing to full-stack web development
You take pride in writing clean code and building performant infrastructure
Experience with Python or Scala
Bonus points if:
You’re interested in A/B testing and conversational in relevant topics like p-values, statistical power, and bias
You take an interest in functional programming languages such as Scala, Haskell, or OCaml

At Asana, we're committed to building teams that include a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, as this is critical to helping us achieve our mission. If you're interested in this role and don't meet every listed requirement, we still encourage you to apply.

What We’ll Offer

Our comprehensive compensation package plays a big part in how we recognize you for the impact you have on our path to achieving our mission. We believe that compensation should be reflective of the value you create relative to the market value of your role. To ensure pay is fair and not impacted by biases, we're committed to looking at market value which is why we check ourselves and conduct a yearly pay equity audit.

For this role, the estimated base salary range is between $176,000 - $224,000. The actual base salary will vary based on various factors, including market and individual qualifications objectively assessed during the interview process. The listed range above is a guideline, and the base salary range for this role may be modified.

In addition to base salary, your compensation package may include additional components such as equity, sales incentive pay (for most sales roles), and benefits. If you're interviewing for this role, speak with your Talent Acquisition Partner to learn more about the total compensation and benefits for this role.

We strive to provide equitable and competitive benefits packages that support our employees worldwide and include:


Mental health, wellness & fitness benefits
Career coaching & support
Inclusive family building benefits
Long-term savings or retirement plans
In-office culinary options to cater to your dietary preferences


These are just some of the benefits we offer, and benefits may vary based on role, country, and local regulations. If you're interviewing for this role, speak with your Talent Acquisition Partner to learn more about the total compensation and benefits for this role.
