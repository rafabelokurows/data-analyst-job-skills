The goal of this platform is to provide new ways for our partners to help their employees get their money right across every life stage.

Act as a curator of data by defining, instrumenting, and tracking necessary analytics of our products by working cross functionally with engineering and product teams.
Build self-service systems to enable others in the organization to leverage your work.
Analyze and perform statistical analysis on data that underlies product experiments.
Build models to help decision makers understand customer behaviors and segmentation
You stay focused on what’s best for the company – sometimes that requires being flexible, other times it requires being steadfast.



What you’ll need:



Bachelor’s degree required (Masters preferred) in Computer Science, Math, Physics, Engineering or quantitative field.

About DoorDash

At DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.

DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, and India.

          <strong>About Phaidra<br><br></strong>Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.<br><br>The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.<br><br>Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:<br><br><ul><li>We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.</li><li>We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.</li><li>We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.<br><br></li></ul>Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.<br><br>Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office.

We are undertaking several new efforts, where you can have an outsized impact on the architecture, implementation, and design choices behind these systems.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching models
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly reduce Stripe’s financial losses
Building systems that evaluate businesses for risk and take appropriate actions
Working with our partner teams to launch new policies that directly impact Stripe’s bottom line
Helping engineers across the company to develop technologies for scaling our infrastructure
Debugging production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 2 years of industry experience in training ML models
Enjoy and have experience shipping ML models in a large-scale production environment
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


Have experience in Python, Scala (Spark), or Ruby



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Atlassian is looking for a senior Data Scientist to join our Experimentation Data Science team. The Experimentation Data Science team partners with the experimentation engineering team to help unlock Atlassian’s experimentation capabilities.

This is a unique opportunity to work in a collaborative environment to create a culture of experimentation and tackle challenging problems as we scale.

Compensation

At Atlassian, we strive to design equitable, explainable, and competitive compensation programs. To support this goal, the baseline of our range is higher than that of the typical market range, but in turn we expect to hire most candidates near this baseline. Base pay within the range is ultimately determined by a candidate's skills, expertise, or experience. In the United States, we have three geographic pay zones. For this role, our current base pay ranges for new hires in each zone are:

Zone A: $175,100 - $233,400

Zone B: $157,600 - $210,100

Zone C: $145,300 - $193,800

This role may also be eligible for benefits, bonuses, commissions, and equity.

Responsibilities

As an Experimentation Data Scientist, you will drive the experimentation execution practices and analyses, collaborating with business, engineering, and data science teams, to enable trustworthy decisions at scale. Additionally, you will lead the organization to develop and adopt novel ways (sprt, stratified random sampling, etc.,) to increase the speed of the experimentation lifecycle.

Qualifications

On the first day, we'll expect you to have


Masters in a quantitative subject (Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Operations Research, or relevant work experience)
3+ years of related industry experience in the data science and experimentation domain
Experience building and scaling experimentation practices, statistical methods, and tools in a large scale organization

Ability to communicate and explain data science and experimentation concepts to diverse audiences by crafting compelling stories that drive behavior change
Focus on business practicality and the 80/20 rule; very high bar for output quality, but recognize the business benefit of ""having something now"" vs ""perfection sometime in the future""
Agile development mindset, appreciating the benefit of constant iteration and improvement



It's great, but not required, if you have


Experience working in a consumer or B2C space for a SaaS product provider, or the enterprise/B2B space
Familiarity working with Growth, Product, and engineering teams
Excelling in solving ambiguous and complex problems, being able to navigate through uncertain situations, breaking down complex challenges into manageable components and developing innovative solutions

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Machine Learning Infrastructure group at Stripe aims to provide state of the art infrastructure and support for building and operationalizing AI/ML models for all business verticals within the company, including but not limited to models that mitigate risks across Stripe’s products and services globally, and models that help our customers to fight fraud by leveraging Stripe’s user facing products like Radar and Identity. ML is a top priority for Stripe in the coming years. With the phenomenal developments happening in the field of AI, we are positioned to accelerate the adoption of AI/ML across all parts of the company by building highly scalable and reliable foundational infrastructure.

What you’ll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching machine learning models using tools such as XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch.
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly impact Stripe’s top line metrics.
Propose new feature ideas and design data pipelines to incorporate them into our models
Improve the way we evaluate and monitor our model and system performance
Collaborate with stakeholders and drive end-to-end projects involving a variety of technologies and systems to successful completion.



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


At least 5 years of industry experience doing end-to-end ML development on a machine learning team and bringing ML models to production
Advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. computer science, statistics, physics, …)
Proficient in Python, Scala, Spark



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Hands-on applied ML (model training, deployment to production, etc) experience
You keep up-to-date on the latest in AI engineering practices and research
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data
Knowledge about how to manipulate data to perform analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to evaluate a hypothesis.
Experience evaluating niche and upcoming ML solutions



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $136,000 - $160,000 per year.

About DoorDash

At DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.

DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities.

Neighbors around the world turn to Nextdoor daily to receive trusted information, give and get help, get things done, and build real-world connections with those nearby — neighbors, businesses, and public services. Today, neighbors rely on Nextdoor in more than 315,000 neighborhoods across 11 countries.

Meet Your Future Neighbors

Product finance, strategy and operations (“Product FSO”) is committed to driving growth through new user acquisition and increasing engagement amongst our existing user base of neighbors. Today, we work closely with product and engineering teams to understand the impact and trends across growth and engagement while building and maintaining our quarterly and long-range forecasts. Historically, we’ve been strong in our reporting and forecasting; however, have lacked the bandwidth and capabilities to dive deeper into our data to better understand “why” we’re seeing what we’re seeing to subsequently get to “what” we should be doing about it.

We are looking for an entrepreneurial and driven Senior Operations Data Scientist to establish the foundation of our data and analytics work. You will work closely with various cross-functional teams such as product, engineering, etc. to develop a BI layer and assist us in better understanding key metrics through causal analyses, data tooling, and dashboarding. Successful candidates will exhibit technical acumen, product sense and business savvy. You are passionate about leveraging the power of data to drive product changes with quality and agility. You are a team player.

At Nextdoor, we offer a warm and inclusive work environment that embraces a hybrid employment experience, providing a flexible experience for our valued employees.

Participate in in-person Nextdoor events, trainings, off-sites, volunteer days, and other team building exercises
Build in-person relationships with team members and contribute to the KIND culture that Nextdoor values


What You’ll Bring To The Team


Advanced degree in a quantitative field and 6 - 8+ years working in data science, product analytics, or business intelligence, or equivalent (starting level is flexible)
Strategic-minded, impact-driven, and capable of incorporating larger business context into data questions and product development
Experience architecting, debugging, and executing SQL queries
Excellent knowledge of Looker (preferred) or another BI/visualization tool
Comfortable knowledge of Python or R, including common scientific computing packages and data science tools such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn

We also expect to award a meaningful equity grant for this role. With equal quarterly vesting, your first vest date would be within the first 3 months of your start date.

Overall, total compensation will vary depending on your relevant skills, experience, and qualifications. We have you covered! Nextdoor employees can choose between a variety of great health plans.

Genesis Therapeutics is unifying AI and biotech to discover novel and breakthrough treatments for patients with severe and devastating conditions. Genesis was founded on groundbreaking molecular ML research and since has established itself as the industry leader in AI for small molecule drug discovery. Our team of accomplished biotech leaders and expert drug hunters joins forces with deep learning researchers and software engineers who are pioneering predictive and generative AI technologies for molecules.

Our team has created the industry's most advanced molecular AI platform called GEMS (Genesis Exploration of Molecular Space), to accelerate and optimize small molecule drug discovery and to enable the discovery of novel first-in-class and best-in-class small molecule drugs for challenging and/or undruggable targets.

The company has leveraged GEMS to build an internal pipeline with multiple programs against high-value targets, including data-poor and canonically undruggable targets where GEMS is uniquely advantaged. In addition, Genesis has two AI platform collaborations across a range of therapeutic areas: Eli Lilly (signed in 2022, with a $20M upfront payment and a $670M total deal size), and Genentech (signed in 2020).

We raised a $200M series B in August 2023, and have raised over $280M in funding from top technology and biotech investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Rock Springs Capital, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, Radical Ventures, NVentures (NVIDIA's VC arm), BlackRock, and Menlo Ventures.

Who we are:

Shape a brighter financial future with us.

Together with our members, we’re changing the way people think about and interact with personal finance.

We’re a next-generation financial services company and national bank using innovative, mobile-first technology to help our millions of members reach their goals. The industry is going through an unprecedented transformation, and we’re at the forefront. We’re proud to come to work every day knowing that what we do has a direct impact on people’s lives, with our core values guiding us every step of the way. Join us to invest in yourself, your career, and the financial world.

The Role

We are seeking a full stack Senior Data Scientist who will help shape business strategy and product development decisions through data-driven insights. This is an exciting role for someone to make a direct impact on new product strategy and revenue of SoFi, supporting SoFi’s B2B business channel called SoFi At Work. The goal of this platform is to provide new ways for our partners to help their employees get their money right across every life stage.

Success in this role hinges on your technical aptitude, quantitative abilities, and business acumen: you know how to plow through data with SQL/Python/R/Tableau, surface insights using math/statistics/ML techniques, and measure the business impact using efficiency/conversion/profit metrics. You treat stakeholders as a partnership – you are there at each step of the way and you know that we only succeed if we succeed together.

This role

What you’ll do:



Work with amazing product and business managers to identify strategic opportunities, measure KPIs to craft compelling stories, make data-driven recommendations, and drive informed actions.
Craft, analyze, and present customer behavior metrics, such as funnel conversion, user churn, features engagement, product LTV, and cross-sell metrics. Work with product and marketing partners to design tests to improve these metrics.
Own end-to-end product analytics workflow including formulating success metrics, socializing them across the organization, and creating dashboards/reports.
Act as a curator of data by defining, instrumenting, and tracking necessary analytics of our products by working cross functionally with engineering and product teams.
Build self-service systems to enable others in the organization to leverage your work.
Analyze and perform statistical analysis on data that underlies product experiments.
Build models to help decision makers understand customer behaviors and segmentation
You stay focused on what’s best for the company – sometimes that requires being flexible, other times it requires being steadfast.



What you’ll need:



Bachelor’s degree required (Masters preferred) in Computer Science, Math, Physics, Engineering or quantitative field.
4+ years of relevant work experience
Intellectual curiosity and aptitude to pick up new technical skills
Exceptional problem-solving skills
Ability to initiate and drive projects to completion with minimal guidance
High EQ with ability to influence outcomes and communicate technical content to general audiences
Strong programming skills in SQL, Python and proficiency in Tableau
Experience with experimentation and hypothesis testing
Ability to work in a dynamic, cross-functional environment, with strong attention to detail
Strong relationship building and collaborative skills
Experience with using DBT/Airflow to build Data Pipelines in Snowflake

Who we are:

Shape a brighter financial future with us.

Together with our members, we’re changing the way people think about and interact with personal finance.

We’re a next-generation financial services company and national bank using innovative, mobile-first technology to help our millions of members reach their goals. The industry is going through an unprecedented transformation, and we’re at the forefront. We’re proud to come to work every day knowing that what we do has a direct impact on people’s lives, with our core values guiding us every step of the way. Join us to invest in yourself, your career, and the financial world.

The Role

We are seeking a full stack Senior Data Scientist who will help shape business strategy and product development decisions through data-driven insights. This is an exciting role for someone to make a direct impact on new product strategy and revenue of SoFi, supporting SoFi’s B2B business channel called SoFi At Work. The goal of this platform is to provide new ways for our partners to help their employees get their money right across every life stage.

Success in this role hinges on your technical aptitude, quantitative abilities, and business acumen: you know how to plow through data with SQL/Python/R/Tableau, surface insights using math/statistics/ML techniques, and measure the business impact using efficiency/conversion/profit metrics. You treat stakeholders as a partnership – you are there at each step of the way and you know that we only succeed if we succeed together.

This role

What you’ll do:



Work with amazing product and business managers to identify strategic opportunities, measure KPIs to craft compelling stories, make data-driven recommendations, and drive informed actions.
Craft, analyze, and present customer behavior metrics, such as funnel conversion, user churn, features engagement, product LTV, and cross-sell metrics. Work with product and marketing partners to design tests to improve these metrics.
Own end-to-end product analytics workflow including formulating success metrics, socializing them across the organization, and creating dashboards/reports.
Act as a curator of data by defining, instrumenting, and tracking necessary analytics of our products by working cross functionally with engineering and product teams.
Build self-service systems to enable others in the organization to leverage your work.
Analyze and perform statistical analysis on data that underlies product experiments.
Build models to help decision makers understand customer behaviors and segmentation
You stay focused on what’s best for the company – sometimes that requires being flexible, other times it requires being steadfast.



What you’ll need:



Bachelor’s degree required (Masters preferred) in Computer Science, Math, Physics, Engineering or quantitative field.
4+ years of relevant work experience
Intellectual curiosity and aptitude to pick up new technical skills
Exceptional problem-solving skills
Ability to initiate and drive projects to completion with minimal guidance
High EQ with ability to influence outcomes and communicate technical content to general audiences
Strong programming skills in SQL, Python and proficiency in Tableau
Experience with experimentation and hypothesis testing
Ability to work in a dynamic, cross-functional environment, with strong attention to detail
Strong relationship building and collaborative skills
Experience with using DBT/Airflow to build Data Pipelines in Snowflake

Descartes was born out of the conviction that the ever-increasing complexity of risks faced by corporations, governments and vulnerable communities calls for a renewed approach in insurance. Our team brings together industry veterans from the most renowned institutions (AXA, SCOR, Swiss Re, Marsh, Aon, ...) and scientists on top of their field to bring underwriting excellence. After 5 years of existence, Descartes has secured a leading position in parametric insurance for weather and climate-related risks utilizing machine learning, real-time monitoring from satellite imagery & IoT. After a successful Series B raise of $120M USD, we launched Descartes Insurance, a 'full stack' insurer licensed to underwrite risk by the French regulator ACPR. With a growing corporate client base (350+ and counting), our diverse team is headquartered in Paris and operates out of our 13 global offices in North America, Europe, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. Descartes is trusted by a panel of A-rated (re)insurers to carry out its activities.

At TOMRA, we want people to innovate, show passion in their work and be responsible. We encourage the freedom to innovate and take risks that result in breakthroughs that challenge the status quo. We value passion that focuses and commits to meeting success. We believe in a responsible and safe mindset that takes care of our customers, products, and fellow employees.

""DoubleVerify Scibids"" is a global leader in AI-powered digital campaign activation. Scibids empowers global brands to drive specific KPIs and tangible outcomes more effectively while improving operational efficiency and reducing manual lift.

To learn more visit https://doubleverify.com/scibids-ai/

Recently, DoubleVerify closed its acquisition of Scibids providing an End-to-end, comprehensive measurement and granular optimization.

DV provides media transparency and accountability to deliver the highest level of impression quality for maximum advertising performance.

""Scibids DoubleVerify"" Technology equips these trading desks with an artificial intelligence software computing the optimal amount to bid for each advertising opportunity, thus bringing the final advertisers dramatic performance and productivity uplifts. The technology developed by Scibids is rooted in a solid scientific and market expertise, with one of the founders holding a PhD. in Machine Learning from ENS Cachan and 10 engineers cumulating 40 years of experience in quantitative advertising.

Our company was selected in 2017 as one of the 62 most innovative startups (amongst 2000+) in the extremely selective “I-Lab” competition by the French public bank & French research ministry. It was also selected in the ""Top 100 French Startup To Follow in 2017"" by Business Insider.

Two years only after its creation, the company already has several dozens of clients throughout the world and its portfolio keeps on growing! In September 2018, Scibids announced a €2,2M funding in order to support its global ambition to remain the largest algorithmic media trading platform in the world.

What you will do & what we offer

The mission of Scibids is to provide media buyers with fully automated buying strategies for display campaigns, leading to uncompared performances for a minimum of human work.

As a DataScientist, your role will be to evaluate and improve ""Scibids DoubleVerify"" bidding algorithms, which are Scibids main asset, and to actively participate into Scibids automation and development process: each business case not yet automatically handled by our product should be met by the corresponding product improvement. This position will combine analytical rigor, a relentless curiosity, a strong knowledge of statistical methods and experience in implementing them.

This position will combine high development standards, a relentless curiosity, a strong understanding of business priorities and the ambition for your work to become a real game changer!

On a day to day basis, your responsibilities will include:


working with massive datasets (billions of ads impressions/month) and millions of variables.
solving non-routine analysis problems (not handled by off-the-shelf ML solvers).


solving challenging scaling/engineering problems as our system produces thousands of ML models per day.


working closely with the commercial and customer success team and help identify the business cases where a new algorithm is needed/existing ones need improvement.
identify and automate any repetitive process taking place at Scibids, including cases where this means developing some AI routines replacing “human common sense”.


Qualifications

Minimum qualifications:


MS degree in applied mathematics (e.g., statistics, probabilities, operations research, machine learning).
Work / academic projects experience in data analysis or related field (e.g., as a statistician/data scientist) with actual algorithms implementation in an industry programming language (eg Python, C++...)


Preferred Qualifications


Professional/academic experience in a SQL-like language.


Technical stack relevant to the position


Python
SQL
Kubernetes, Docker, Github
Google Cloud Environment, App Engine Standard, Cloud SQL, Google Cloud Datastore...


Cultural fit


Do things only once. No repetitive task survives ingenuity and automation: at Scibids, everything needs to scale!
Base your decisions on data points. Preconceived personal convictions rarely survive thorough confrontation with actual data.
Work in a team and be curious. Every Scibids member has stock-options and is focused on the same objective: make Scibids the next adtech unicorn! This means being interested in how one’s daily personal work fits in Scibids general strategy and having in mind the greater good of the company rather than individual accomplishments.
Have a good laugh. We are a young, hard-working team with huge ambitions: nothing wipes off long hours of work better than sharing a drink with the team!


Others


Contract type: full-time position (French “CDI”).
Based in Paris (75008) – Champs-Elysées
Preferred availability: ASAP
Compensation: competitive package including fix salary.
Exact figures depend on profile.
