About the New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt, the best place to order groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, and other retail goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!) 🚀

About The New Verticals Analytics Team

Our New Verticals Analytics team sits at the intersection of product development, strategic planning, and operational execution. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design, and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions, to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience that combines scientific expertise with stakeholder engagement. When you join this team, you will be taking ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from the ground up, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we want you on our team.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
4+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis using statistical software packages in Python or R.
Expertise in causal inference (Diff in Diff, Synthetic control).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That’s where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $20M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Software Engineer for Machine Learning (d/f/m) at Aignostics, you work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art of machine learning for digital pathology. You will develop distributed software systems for machine learning applications that will help to improve cancer research and diagnostics. Together with your colleagues you will take care of the machine learning software stack and thereby enable our teams to build medical grade quality and scalable machine learning models.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Define, benchmark, and continually refine performance metrics with both short-term and long-term plans.


We're seeking someone with expertise in LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation, fine-tuning, and prompting techniques. Your contributions will be essential in propelling our AI advancements and securing our market position.

Qualifications


5+ years of experience as an AI/ML engineer or comparable academic background

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That’s where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $20M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Senior Data Scientist in Aignostic's foundation model team you will work on our self-supervised base models. Together with collaborators in academia and industry you will push the state of the art in large-scale machine learning for digital pathology. Within our team of experts on large-scale machine learning and data handling, you will work on improving, benchmarking and extending our family of best-in-class foundations models, bridging image, text and other pathology data modalities. Moreover, using our foundation models you will contribute to developing prototypes for new applications to assist pathologists and generate new insights for improving cancer treatment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

About Us

We are a dynamic, newly funded stealth company on a mission to revolutionize the audit space (financial, IT, and ESG). Traditional audits involve tedious manual checks on unstructured data, frustrating both auditees and auditors. Meanwhile, the demand for audits is skyrocketing.

Lead the development and implementation of RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) pipelines.
Define, benchmark, and continually refine performance metrics with both short-term and long-term plans.



We're seeking someone with expertise in LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation, fine-tuning, and prompting techniques. Your contributions will be essential in propelling our AI advancements and securing our market position.

Qualifications


5+ years of experience as an AI/ML engineer or comparable academic background
Proven track record in building complex RAG pipelines
Skilled in evaluating and benchmarking LLMs
Proficient in fine-tuning and reinforcement learning
Strong knowledge of prompting techniques

Beautiful office in Berlin with home office days
Opportunity to join a small, agile team with a big mission
Significant growth and learning opportunities from day one
Be part of an inclusive, diverse workplace dedicated to innovation and excellence

Ausgeprägte Kommunikationsstärke in Deutsch und Englisch - im Team und Kunden gegenüber
Neugierde und Bereitschaft zu gelegentlichen Reisen


Das bieten wir Ihnen

Mensch & Kultur: Die Gemeinschaft und der Austausch im Unternehmen werden durch vielfältige Events wie Unternehmensmittagessen, Sommerfeste, Teamevents, Unternehmenskonferenzen und Weihnachtsfeiern aktiv gefördert. Ein Welcome Day sowie ein Mentoren-Programm während der Einarbeitungszeit tragen zudem dazu bei, den Zusammenhalt innerhalb der Teams zu stärken. Zusätzlich fördern wir den Teamgeist durch eine substanzielle Gewinnbeteiligung, die auf alle Mitarbeiter verteilt wird.

Karriereentwicklung & Wissensaustausch: Die Vielfalt unserer (Kunden-)Projekte ermöglicht eine individuelle Karriereentwicklung. Verschiedenste Schulungsangebote und die Teilnahme an Fachkonferenzen fördern fachliches Wachstum. Ein jährliches Wissensbudget von 12 Tagen und Wissenszirkel unterstützen den kontinuierlichen Wissensaustausch.

Work-Life-Balance & Flexibilität: Flexible Arbeitszeiten mit Arbeitszeitkonto, Mobile Office/hybrides Arbeiten, Workation-/Sabbatical-Optionen und die Möglichkeit Hunde mit ins Büro zu bringen, sind nur ein Teil unseres Angebots für Flexibilität und Lebensqualität. Auch in kritischen Situationen unterstützen wir mit bis zu 5 bezahlten Abwesenheitstagen, um sich um pflegebedürftige oder kranke Familienmitglieder zu kümmern.

Finanzielle Vorteile: Mitarbeiter profitieren von unseren Zuschüssen für: Kinderbetreuung, Essen und Sport, betriebliche Altersvorsorge mit unverbindlicher Beratung, Deutschlandticket für nachhaltiges Reisen.

Gesundheit & Wohlbefinden: Verschiedene Gesundheitsmaßnahmen wie bewegte Pausen, Ergonomieberatung, Grippeimpfung und Augenarztuntersuchung fördern das Wohlbefinden und die langfristige Gesundheit der Mitarbeiter.

Und um auch die soziale Interaktion zu stärken, haben wir Hobby- und Sportgruppen etabliert, welche nicht nur den lockeren Austausch, sondern auch den Zusammenhalt im Team stärken.

We're looking for an awesome someone to join our Support Group, the development organization that builds our in-house customer service tooling. They work on topics like support chat, operational tooling for support agents, and self-service and automation. We see great opportunities for applying machine learning and AI in this domain, and are now strengthening the data science team there.

We're looking for someone to take the helm of the Data Science Team Lead role.

The engineers and other crafts have their own people leads. Your focus is going to be on the Data Science side.

You know what it takes to scale Data Science as a function, take exceptional care of exceptional people, and above all: take our Data Science to the next level by also working hands-on owning Machine Learning and AI use cases as part of that team. You'll be a facilitator and an enabler for the team to do what they do best by making personal development plans, hosting regular 1on1s, and so forth. You’ll work directly with senior stakeholders to set the data science vision and direction for the group, executing and implementing DS/ML projects end to end.

We’ll be looking for you to facilitate the future of Data Science at Wolt, whether that’s hiring new team members, levelling up Data Science across the company, or helping the organization to understand the possibilities of Data Science, Machine Learning and AI.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Berlin, Helsinki, or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Germany and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.

You have previous experience building Data Science, Machine Learning and AI solutions with a measurable impact. You understand how to build data products, and deeply care about the end user experience;
You also understand what it takes to build production-level ML and AI solutions, and can help the team members with technical challenges. You have experience with real-time applications and large scale deployments, and can handle the entire life cycle of data science solutions from ideation to maintenance;
We would also like you to have strong experience in leading a technical Data Science team to make sure we keep on improving our DS best practices at Wolt while taking care of our people;
You have previous experience from making personal development plans, hosting regular 1on1s, and taking part in recruitment;

Interest towards LLMs and GenAI and their applications to solving problems in production.
You’ll also need to be the representative of your function towards the rest of the organization, so strong communication and presentation skills are needed. We value experience in working with senior stakeholders to set the team vision and direction.
Lastly, as this is a team effort you have to be a strong cultural leader that cares for the well-being and constant improvement of your team members and represents Wolt values as your daily work.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

About Us

Sunday Natural emerged from a long-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.

We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegetarian, mostly vegan. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.

We have a diverse team of 190 people and 37 nationalities, still growing but at a sustainable rate. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.

We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.

That’s waiting for you at Sainsbury’s. We’re one of the biggest supermarkets in the UK with one of the largest websites. So marketing here really happens at scale. We move a lot faster than you’d think too, across Brand Planning, Brand Comms and Creative, Digital Marketing, CRM and Loyalty, Nectar 360, Insights, and Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability. More people shopping with us each week means more interactions. And thanks to data insight, we understand customers in a way that almost nobody else does. We work alongside incredible brand partners and the best agencies around. So if you have a passion to learn, grow and experience new teams, come and explore it all with us.

The big question: why on earth should a Tech professional like you work for a 150-year-old retail chain? Because we’re on a journey. Changing the way we operate. Learning to think nimble. Giving our teams the time and freedom they need to push boundaries. To create amazing systems and technologies. To give our colleagues and our customers even more incredible experiences.

There are thousands of experts to talk to and learn from. We’ve got data from billions of transactions for our teams to play with. Things get built here. They get made here. They hit customers and colleagues quickly. Welcome to the home of Sainsbury's Data.

More About The Role

We have ~50 Analysts and Data Scientists within Marketing focusing on the broad spectrum of customer analytics, and we have 30 million known customers to play with…

This sub team is focussed on building our personalised customer decisioning engine. We are ultimately the brain behind an optimised selection of offers, mechanics and discounts used to drive desired customer behaviour. We do our most complex modelling, forecasting, tool building, and insights-generation and we use agile working methodologies to make sure we’re prioritising the right outcomes. Our Data Scientists are critical in supporting Sainsbury’s to be successful in our corporate strategy of Knowing Our Customers Better Than Anyone Else.

You will be delivering, analysing, evolving and innovating: efficient, accurate and pacey delivery of code that drives both loyalty and commercial value is the order of the day.

Specifically, this Data Scientist role will be supporting the team in the following:


Understanding known behaviour and trends across Sainsbury’s.
Building our “Next Best Message” capability, aiming to choose the right message to a particular customer, at the right time, through the right channel and for the right value.
Understanding how customers see value and the profitability of an individual’s relationship and sensitivity with price, promotions, Nectar points and offers in order to consider our levers for growth.
Identifying new approaches and methodologies develop how we do things.
Being the first port of call when it comes to leveraging our Group-wide dataset and feeding requirements into our Single Customer View data team.
Ensuring every bit of code and output we deliver is documented, repeatable, scalable and sharable via appropriate, collaborative tools (e.g. Git, Confluence).
Being an active, participating member of the wider Analytical community at Sainsbury’s.
Pairing with Data Engineers to productionise our outputs.


What we’re looking for:


At least 2-3 years’ experience in a data science role (Graduates with no experience will not be suitable)
Extensive programming ability across Python and strong ability to use SQL, with a proven experience of analysing data in a corporate environment.
Experience using Jupyter notebooks and version control within a team using Git.
Strong analytical skills and statistical foundation in concepts such as predictive modelling, clustering and time series analysis.
Experience using cloud platforms such as AWS or Azure and associated ML tools is desirable but not essential.
A curious problem solver who is proactive at developing their technical skills.
Business acumen and commercial awareness
Ability to articulate required outcomes and present analytics work succinctly.
Independence to achieve results and work under own guidance and initiative

That’s waiting for you at Sainsbury’s. We’re one of the biggest supermarkets in the UK with one of the largest websites. So marketing here really happens at scale. We move a lot faster than you’d think too, across Brand Planning, Brand Comms and Creative, Digital Marketing, CRM and Loyalty, Nectar 360, Insights, and Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability. More people shopping with us each week means more interactions. And thanks to data insight, we understand customers in a way that almost nobody else does. We work alongside incredible brand partners and the best agencies around. So if you have a passion to learn, grow and experience new teams, come and explore it all with us.

The big question: why on earth should a Tech professional like you work for a 150-year-old retail chain? Because we’re on a journey. Changing the way we operate. Learning to think nimble. Giving our teams the time and freedom they need to push boundaries. To create amazing systems and technologies. To give our colleagues and our customers even more incredible experiences.

There are thousands of experts to talk to and learn from. We’ve got data from billions of transactions for our teams to play with. Things get built here. They get made here. They hit customers and colleagues quickly. Welcome to the home of Sainsbury's Data.

More About The Role

We have ~50 Analysts and Data Scientists within Marketing focusing on the broad spectrum of customer analytics, and we have 30 million known customers to play with…

This sub team is focussed on building our personalised customer decisioning engine. We are ultimately the brain behind an optimised selection of offers, mechanics and discounts used to drive desired customer behaviour. We do our most complex modelling, forecasting, tool building, and insights-generation and we use agile working methodologies to make sure we’re prioritising the right outcomes. Our Data Scientists are critical in supporting Sainsbury’s to be successful in our corporate strategy of Knowing Our Customers Better Than Anyone Else.

You will be delivering, analysing, evolving and innovating: efficient, accurate and pacey delivery of code that drives both loyalty and commercial value is the order of the day.

Specifically, this Data Scientist role will be supporting the team in the following:


Understanding known behaviour and trends across Sainsbury’s.
Building our “Next Best Message” capability, aiming to choose the right message to a particular customer, at the right time, through the right channel and for the right value.
Understanding how customers see value and the profitability of an individual’s relationship and sensitivity with price, promotions, Nectar points and offers in order to consider our levers for growth.
Identifying new approaches and methodologies develop how we do things.
Being the first port of call when it comes to leveraging our Group-wide dataset and feeding requirements into our Single Customer View data team.
Ensuring every bit of code and output we deliver is documented, repeatable, scalable and sharable via appropriate, collaborative tools (e.g. Git, Confluence).
Being an active, participating member of the wider Analytical community at Sainsbury’s.
Pairing with Data Engineers to productionise our outputs.


What we’re looking for:


At least 2-3 years’ experience in a data science role (Graduates with no experience will not be suitable)
Extensive programming ability across Python and strong ability to use SQL, with a proven experience of analysing data in a corporate environment.
Experience using Jupyter notebooks and version control within a team using Git.
Strong analytical skills and statistical foundation in concepts such as predictive modelling, clustering and time series analysis.
Experience using cloud platforms such as AWS or Azure and associated ML tools is desirable but not essential.
A curious problem solver who is proactive at developing their technical skills.
Business acumen and commercial awareness
Ability to articulate required outcomes and present analytics work succinctly.
Independence to achieve results and work under own guidance and initiative
Able to have effective technical conversations with data engineers.
Curiosity, scepticism and attention to detail regarding data quality, samples, bias and ethics.
An awareness and understanding of technology trends and direction in Analytics. 


We are committed to being a truly inclusive retailer, so you’ll be welcomed whoever you are and wherever you work. Around here, there’s always the chance to try something new - whether that’s as part of an evolving team or somewhere else across the business - and we take development seriously and promise to support you. We also recognise and celebrate colleagues when they go the extra mile and, where possible, offer flexible working. When you join our team, we’ll also offer you an amazing range of benefits. Here are some of them:

Starting off with colleague discount, you'll be able to get 10% off at Sainsbury's, Argos, TU and Habitat after 4 weeks. This increases to 15% off at Sainsbury’s every Friday and Saturday and 15% off at Argos every pay day. We've also got you covered for your future with our pensions scheme and life cover. You'll also be able to share in our success as you may be eligible for a performance-related bonus of up to 10% of salary, depending on how we perform.

Your wellbeing is important to us too. You'll receive an annual holiday allowance, and you can buy additional holiday. We also offer other benefits that will help your money go further such as season ticket loans, cycle to work scheme, health cash plans, pay advance (where you can access some of your pay before pay day) as well access to a great range of discounts from hundreds of other retailers. And if you ever need it there is also an employee assistance programme.

Moments that matter are as important to us as they are to you which is why we give up to 26 weeks’ pay for maternity or adoption leave and up to 4 weeks’ pay for paternity leave.

Please see www.sainsburys.jobs for a range of our benefits (note, length of service and eligibility criteria may apply).

Our vision is fast technology, fair service, and honest values. All at the tap of a phone, all the time.

We are about giving customers a new way to spend, save and manage their money while taking better care of the planet which has seen us become a multi-award winning bank that now employs over 2800 across five offices in London, Cardiff, Dublin, Southampton, and Manchester. Our journey started in 2014, and since then we have surpassed 3.5 million accounts (and four account types!) with 350,000 business customers. We are a fully licensed UK bank but at the heart, we are a tech first company, enabling our platform to deliver brilliant products.

Our technologists are at the very heart of Starling and enjoy working in a fast-paced environment that is all about building things, creating new stuff, and disruptive technology that keeps us on the cutting edge of fintech. We operate a flat structure to empower you to make decisions regardless of what your primary responsibilities may be, innovation and collaboration will be at the core of everything you do. Help is never far away in our open culture, you will find support in your team and from across the business, we are in this together!

The way to thrive and shine within Starling is to be a self-driven individual and be able to take full ownership of everything around you: From building things, designing, discovering, to sharing knowledge with your colleagues and making sure all processes are efficient and productive to deliver the best possible results for our customers. Our purpose is underpinned by five Starling values: Listen, Keep It Simple, Do The Right Thing, Own It, and Aim For Greatness.

Hybrid Working

We have a Hybrid approach to working here at Starling - our preference is that you're located within a commutable distance of one of our offices so that we're able to interact and collaborate in person. We don't like to mandate how much you visit the office and work from home, that's to be agreed upon between you and your manager.

We are looking for Data Scientists with experience working in Marketing to help the bank solve complex problems using Machine Learning. In this role, you'll use your skills and passion for data to understand our customers and drive growth through effective marketing strategies.

Responsibilites:

Develop and refine models to predict customer lifetime value (LTV) to optimise marketing investments and resource allocation.
Analyse customer behaviour and product usage data to identify target audiences and tailor marketing efforts for maximum impact.
Employ causal models to evaluate the effectiveness of CRM and invite campaigns and use causal inference to personalise campaigns for individual users.
Contribute to building and interpreting Marketing Mix Models (MMM) to understand the best growth activities.
Collaborate with Data Analysts to ensure they effectively utilise the models you build.



Requirements



We're open-minded when it comes to hiring and we care more about aptitude and attitude than specific experience or qualifications. We think the ideal candidate will encompass most of the following:

Solid understanding of customer lifetime value (LTV) modelling and marketing mix modelling.
Deep understanding of statistics, especially Bayesian reasoning, and the ability to assess the accuracy of your results.
Experience with causal inference concepts and machine learning models for causal inference.
Comfortable with a variety of modelling techniques, including gradient boosting, neural networks, linear regression, and blending these approaches.
Expert in Python with the ability to make well-reasoned design decisions in your code.
Comfortable working with external data sources through APIs.
Ability to see the bigger picture of business processes and clearly define how models can be integrated and add value.
Excellent communication and visualisation skills to effectively present your findings to different audiences.

Interview Process

Interviewing is a two way process and we want you to have the time and opportunity to get to know us, as much as we are getting to know you! Our interviews are conversational and we want to get the best from you, so come with questions and be curious. In general you can expect the below, following a chat with one of our Talent Team:

Stage 1 - 45 mins with one of the team
Stage 2 - Take home test
Stage 3 - 60 mins technical interview with two team members
Stage 4 - 45 min final with an executive and a member of the people team





Benefits



• 33 days holiday (including flexible bank holidays)

• An extra day's holiday for your birthday

• 16 hours paid volunteering time a year

• Part-time and/or flexible hours available for most roles

A large segment of the legal industry works on transactional legal processes. Building a wind farm, merging two companies or selling a skyscraper - lawyers help make these things happen and their work is surprisingly similar to planning and leading a technology project. There are documents to be produced, agreements to get signed, and a whole lot of detail to be understood, agreed and made clear. There's an order in which things need doing and there are stages that need to be complete before you can move on.

For example, how do you make sure that when you buy a building you're getting all the land you think you're getting? How do you make sure you don't fund a wind farm and then find that there is no permission to build it or that the people you funded are scammers? How do you make sure there isn't an ambiguous clause that'll make it all go wrong? You get a lawyer to manage the transaction.

Since the dawn of Microsoft Word, this humble word processor has been the default way to manage these legal transactions. We want to change this, by building a platform that allows transactions to be managed online, and in a collaborative way. That means we're on a mission to transform the $600bn market for legal services worldwide.

Our customers include some of the world's top law firms, such as Allen & Overy, Hogan Lovells, Herbert Smith Freehills, Shearman & Sterling and King & Wood Mallesons. And we've been used on transactions in more than 60 countries

The Role

Do you dream of using AI to revolutionise the way legal deals get done?

We're a growing legal tech start-up building software for transactional lawyers who work on high-stakes deals, like building power plants or merging major companies. We're looking for a passionate and curious Entry-Level AI Developer/Engineer to join our team and help us push the boundaries of what's possible.

What you'll be doing:


Develop, extend, and maintain our existing suite of AI/ML services
Design and build exciting new AI features for our products
Collaborate with a talented team of engineers on a fast-paced, impactful project
Get hands-on experience with all aspects of designing, implementing, and operating internet-facing SaaS software (from time to time we'll need you to get involved in areas beyond AI/ML, using your JavaScript knowledge to contribute to the backend or frontend of our product set and to help integrate the ML services you've built)



Who would you be working with?

Steve Wheeler, CTO - who you will be reporting into, alongside a welcoming, inclusive and committed team.

Team culture is really important to us. We are looking for someone who is excited to join us as a key employee at this important stage in our growth and who will bring new and exciting perspectives to Legatics. We are a friendly and passionate bunch with a wide range of interests. We love to socialise together too, holding regular team events.

Is a team player: You thrive in a collaborative environment and are eager to learn from experienced developers
Tech Savvy: You have some experience with building and cleaning datasets, designing and interpreting ML experiments, documenting and communicating results



Bonus points if:


You have experience with backend or frontend engineering in JavaScript
You have experience with Python
You've built your own AI/ML project (personal or professional)
You can tell us why you're passionate about legal tech and using AI to improve the legal industry

Technology

We follow a microservices approach written in Node.js on AWS, managed using Terraform, Kustomize and Kubernetes. GraphQL and Apollo are used between front and backend. Our frontend is an SPA built with React and Redux, with some Ramda. We have a dedicated test / QA team, doing a combination of manual and automated testing.

Power in diversity

We put users at the heart of our design to provide legal transaction experiences that everyone loves. In order to make that a reality, we seek to foster a diverse and inclusive working environment that can empower our people to be creative, effective and innovative, to build a brand we are proud of.

We don't discriminate against gender, race, religion or belief, disability, age, marital status or sexual orientation. Whatever your background may be, we welcome anyone with talent, drive and emotional intelligence. We're committed to building a diverse team and are constantly looking for ways to improve our processes to help us do that.

✨Who we are

Co-founded by Mikhail Dubov and Dmitry Isupov in 2015 while at Entrepreneur First, Chattermill was born out of their frustration that it took weeks, sometimes months, for customer research to yield any quality insights. Often, these would be out of date by the time they reached decision-makers. And it was also financially out of reach for most companies.

When they started what eventually became Chattermill, they had a hunch that they could use the newly available tech of deep learning to help companies find insights amidst messy data. Their vision was to take what agencies and cutting-edge brands were doing by hand and automate it.

Today, our Unified Customer Intelligence platform is used by the world’s best-loved customer-centric companies, including Uber, HelloFresh, Wise, and more, all of whom can now see and act on their customer reality.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Consistent with our One Onex approach, the teams share and leverage sector expertise, and sourcing and origination opportunities across all business lines.




Our culture is guided by our strong commitment to accountability, intellectual honesty and respect for all our

our team is united in recognizing the value of collaboration, diversity of perspective and background, and an

inclusive environment. Our team is a critical factor in our success, and attracting and retaining the best people

and strongest investors are an important competitive advantage.




Also crucial to our long-term success is the alignment of interests between the Onex management team, shareholders and clients.

We believe this alignment creates stronger relationships with both clients and shareholders.

We expect our program to continue to expand in line with this rapidly evolving area, while remaining rooted in our founding principle of responsible investing.

BCG’s clients are the world’s top business leaders. From computers to retailing, our professional expertise spans over 50 industries. The vast majority of our clients rank among the 500 largest companies in each of our three major regions–Americas (North and South), Europe Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Additionally, we work with a number of small- to medium-sized companies, both public and private.

We pride ourselves on our fresh thinking. Our evolving ideas profoundly change the way most businesses think about competition. Many leading business concepts over the past three decades originated with BCG–including, experience curve, time-based competition, Segment-of-One® marketing, deconstruction, and trading up. Our recent Collateral Damage publication series has addressed the implications for managers of the on-going financial crisis.

We believe that no other consulting organization has concentrated as thoroughly on understanding business competition and helping companies make the changes necessary to succeed in increasingly competitive markets.

La réputation mondiale du cabinet de conseil en gestion Boston Consulting Group (BCG), comme l'un des meilleurs en gestion, découle de plus de cinquante années d'expérience à aider les cadres supérieurs à découvrir et réaliser tout le potentiel de leur entreprise. Notre mission consiste à appuyer nos clients à réaliser des avantages concurrentiels durables en offrant des solutions personnalisées.

De plus, nous travaillons avec un certain nombre de petites et moyennes entreprises, tant publiques que privées.

Notre succès, provenant des mandats qui nous sont assignés, nous permet d'établir des relations à long terme avec nos clients.

Nous sommes fiers de notre approche innovatrice. Nos idées évolutives changent profondément la manière dont la plupart des entreprises considèrent la concurrence. Plusieurs des principaux concepts d'affaires, au cours des trois dernières décennies, ont commencé avec BCG, y compris la courbe d'apprentissage, la concurrence calculée sur le temps, le marketing Segment-of-One®, le démantèlement et l'extension ascendante. Nos récentes publications de la série Collateral Damage ont traité de l'implication des dirigeants face à la crise financière en cours.

Nous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

          <strong>About Stripe<br><br></strong>Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.<br><br><strong>About The Team<br><br></strong>Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do<br><br>We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.<br><br>Who you are<br><br>We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.<br><br><strong>Minimum Requirements<br><br></strong><ul><li>2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience</li><li>Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R </li><li>Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation</li><li>Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results</li><li>Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact</li><li>A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail</li><li>Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations</li><li>A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom<br><br><br></li></ul><strong>Preferred Qualifications<br><br></strong><ul><li>Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance</li><li>Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs</li><li>Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.</li><li>A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)<br><br><br></li></ul>Hybrid work at Stripe<br><br>This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).<br><br>Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.<br><br>A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.<br><br>Pay and benefits<br><br>The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.<br><br>Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is a global management consulting firm and the world’s leading advisor on business strategy. We partner with clients from the private, public, and not-for-profit sectors in all regions to identify their highest-value opportunities, address their most critical challenges, and transform their enterprises. Our customized approach combines deep insight into the dynamics of companies and markets with close collaboration at all levels of the client organization. This ensures that our clients achieve sustainable competitive advantage, build more capable organizations, and secure lasting results. Founded in 1963, BCG is a private company with offices in more than 90 cities in 50 countries. For more information, please visit bcg.com.

BCG’s clients are the world’s top business leaders. From computers to retailing, our professional expertise spans over 50 industries. The vast majority of our clients rank among the 500 largest companies in each of our three major regions–Americas (North and South), Europe Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Additionally, we work with a number of small- to medium-sized companies, both public and private.

The success of our assignments routinely leads our clients to maintain long-term relationships with us. Over 85 percent of our revenues come from clients who continue to work with us from one year to the next to maintain the momentum for change and to continually improve bottom-line results they have achieved with our help.

We pride ourselves on our fresh thinking. Our evolving ideas profoundly change the way most businesses think about competition. Many leading business concepts over the past three decades originated with BCG–including, experience curve, time-based competition, Segment-of-One® marketing, deconstruction, and trading up. Our recent Collateral Damage publication series has addressed the implications for managers of the on-going financial crisis.

We believe that no other consulting organization has concentrated as thoroughly on understanding business competition and helping companies make the changes necessary to succeed in increasingly competitive markets.

La réputation mondiale du cabinet de conseil en gestion Boston Consulting Group (BCG), comme l'un des meilleurs en gestion, découle de plus de cinquante années d'expérience à aider les cadres supérieurs à découvrir et réaliser tout le potentiel de leur entreprise. Notre mission consiste à appuyer nos clients à réaliser des avantages concurrentiels durables en offrant des solutions personnalisées.

Nous collaborons avec chaque client pour l'aider à prendre une direction et à faire face aux défis organisationnels et opérationnels.

Fondé en 1963, BCG compte maintenant plus de 11,000 experts-conseils, et ce, dans plus de 90 bureaux dans le monde entier. Les clients du BCG sont les dirigeants des plus importantes entreprises du monde. Des ordinateurs jusqu'à la vente au détail, notre expertise professionnelle s'étend à plus de 50 industries. La grande majorité de nos clients figurent parmi les 500 plus grandes entreprises dans chacune de nos trois régions principales – Les Amériques (nord et sud), l'Europe (incluant le Moyen-Orient et l'Afrique) et l'Asie-Pacifique.

Plusieurs des principaux concepts d'affaires, au cours des trois dernières décennies, ont commencé avec BCG, y compris la courbe d'apprentissage, la concurrence calculée sur le temps, le marketing Segment-of-One®, le démantèlement et l'extension ascendante. Nos récentes publications de la série Collateral Damage ont traité de l'implication des dirigeants face à la crise financière en cours.

Nous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.

You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Come take off with us!

The yearly total compensation for this senior position ranges from $150,000 to $350,000 CAD. Compensation will be determined by candidates' relevant qualifications, knowledge, skills and work experience. Total compensation can include a solid base salary and will also include equity (options / RSUs), sign-on bonus and other potential incentives.

We build machine learning services and data pipelines to automatically extract insights about competitors from both public and internal data sources. Every day, our services process millions of data points, including news articles, press releases, webpage changes, Slack posts, emails, reviews, CRM opportunities, and user actions. We utilize a broad array of ML techniques, including classification, clustering, recommendation, summarization, prompt engineering, vector search, and retrieval augmented generation.

Q: Klue who?

A: We’re Klue and from a technical perspective, Klue’s mission is to descale huge amounts of data to the human level, so people can process it and make use of it. Klue is that trusted intermediary, right now it’s proven for sales enablement, but tomorrow it’s all teams enablement.

Q: What level of experience are we looking for?

A: Right now we are looking for senior-level experienced Back-End Engineers with a background in GenAI, LLMs, or NLP-related work.

Q: What is our development team working on?

A: Services for collecting, processing, and generating timely, relevant intel that is accurately linked to competitors, products, industries, and people

As part of our backend team, we are concerned with data storage and retrieval and the infrastructure to enable that. Here’s what our development team is working on and the opportunity for motivated Software Engineers to dig into, alongside us:


Big Data - lots of data
Ingesting hundreds of thousands of news articles, web pages, marketing, and sales data points per day. The challenge is indexing them for a long period of time and making them searchable and ready for different analyses.
Expanding our Rails REST API and offering public APIs to enable integrations.
Architect infrastructure for a scalable, resilient, and robust service. We are migrating from a monolith architecture to K8S-hosted microservices.
Retrieval Augmented Generation for Compete - An end-to-end system that ingests a real-time feed of compete content from various sources such as Slack, reviews, websites, news, interviews, sales calls, and documents, to generate relevant and factually accurate content


Q: What is our current tech stack?

A: Python (Flask), PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, GCP, AWS, Tensorflow, Keras, Docker, Kubernetes.

Transformers, Pytorch, Hugging Face, Spacy, Sklearn, Pinecone, Kubeflow, Vertex AI, BentoML, Temporal, JS, Github, GPT.

We believe in using whatever tools make sense to get the job done and support our game-changing innovation.

Q: Are you HYBRID FRIENDLY 🤩 ?

A: YES! Hybrid. Best of both worlds (remote & in-office)

Our main Canadian hubs are in Vancouver and Toronto, and most of our teams are located in EST and PST.

You and your team will be in office at least 2 days per week.

Q: What skills do you bring?


Expertise in Python
You stay up to date on recent advances with LLMs and are quick to experiment with the latest approaches including RAG
You own initiatives end to end: from prototyping to production
You lead technical design discussions, write and review technical design documents, and provide technical guidance and directions to the larger engineering team
Expertise in relational databases such as PostgreSQL or MySQL
You are proficient in designing, implementing, and deploying RESTful APIs and you have experience with (non)relational and vector databases.
Experience using Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP
You demonstrate good judgment when making architectural decisions and you understand how those decisions fit into the bigger picture
Experience using NoSQL databases such as Elasticsearch or MongoDB is a plus


Q: What motivates our current team right now?


The type of work. Challenging, stimulating and meaningful work. New and relevant tech stack. We know engineers/developers especially want to work on hard technical and innovative problems.
The inspiration from skilled and proven leaders.
Entrepreneurial fingerprints on what will be a future billion dollar company anchored in Canada.
Culture, team, and the work environment.
High degree of autonomy and accountability.
High degrees of transparency and high quality communication.


Q: What are the people at Klue like?


Builders
Intellectually Curious
Ambitious
Objective Oriented
Check us out!


Q: What about total compensation & benefits?


Benefits. We currently have extended health benefits starting on your 1st day.
Time off. Take what you need. We want the team to prioritize wellness and avoid burnout. Vacation usually falls into 3 categories: recharging, life-event, & keeping a work-life balance. Just ensure the required work gets done and clear it with your team in advance. You need to take at least two weeks off every year. The average Klue team member takes 2-4 weeks of PTO per year.


⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️

Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical.

It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do


Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications

Who you are


You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes

Help us build a world where every student graduates, confident and prepared, through innovative applications of data science. Are you our dynamic Staff Data Scientist focusing on simulation, forecasts, user and system behavior models, and more? This is a technically engaged, high-visibility position breaking new trails for the company. We are full-stack Data Scientists, problem solvers who start from DWH tables (and sometimes raw data), explore data, build models, and productionalize into our common Data Engineering and ML Engineering framework.

Search Engine Optimization is an art form to which we are bringing more scientific, measurement, and statistical rigor. As one of the largest sites on the internet (100M+ indexed pages, 1B+ pageviews/year, 100M+ users/year), we have enough data to make meaningful innovations and a world-class in-house SEO team to partner with. Organic traffic is our lifeblood, so improving our understanding of search algorithms through measurement, experimentation, and modeling will improve our search rankings and, therefore, drive growth for the business.

Here are some ways you’ll make an impact!


Build a system of models that predicts each page’s crawl, indexation, search ranking, and traffic, controlling for endogenous site changes. The aggregation of this is a continually updating forecast of these KPIs for the business, and a synthetic control against which to evaluate experimental results.
Build an orthogonal model to validate the bottom-up simulation described above and summarize top-level domain health. Build anomaly detection routines that detect risks at all margins.
Work with SEO Strategists and peer Data Scientists to understand SEO best practices, propose strategic ideas, and develop measurement techniques. Build reusable analysis tools for sample sizing and post-test analysis; formulate hypotheses to improve model accuracy and conduct rigorous testing.
Discover and validate key performance metrics, for ourselves and competitors; develop models and datasets for synthetic control.
Propose experimentation strategies utilizing our primary coursehero.com domain and our dozens of other domains. Scale the above models to our other domains.


Are you our next Staff Data Scientist?


6+ years data science experience of continually increasing complexity and impact.
2+ years experience building forecasting and/or simulation models.
MS or PhD degree in an applicable quantitative field like Statistics, Math, Engineering, Science, Economics, Econometrics, Operations Research, Social Science, or similar.
Excellent proficiency in Python (or R), SQL skill, and an obsession with data breadth, depth, and quality. Propose and research new/additional data sources.
Deep understanding of statistics and probability, quantitative sciences, data analysis, predictive and ML modeling.
Strong problem-solving, detail orientation, and communication; a bias towards taking action quickly, making things happen, learning, and correcting course as you receive feedback.
Experience shipping large-scale inference models based on disparate data sources and non-obvious measurement techniques. This is both a research and an applied position.
Bonus: Knowledge of SEO, Brand Marketing Measurement, or similar hard-to-measure domains.


Benefits & Perks!


Competitive salary, annual bonus, and RSUs
Medical coverage, including full dental and vision
Life and disability benefits
401(k) program (US) / retirement savings plan (Canada) with company match

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Ready to ? Who you are:


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.

Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture.

You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical.

It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

Help us build a world where every student graduates, confident and prepared, through innovative applications of data science. Are you our dynamic Staff Data Scientist focusing on simulation, forecasts, user and system behavior models, and more? This is a technically engaged, high-visibility position breaking new trails for the company. We are full-stack Data Scientists, problem solvers who start from DWH tables (and sometimes raw data), explore data, build models, and productionalize into our common Data Engineering and ML Engineering framework.

Search Engine Optimization is an art form to which we are bringing more scientific, measurement, and statistical rigor. As one of the largest sites on the internet (100M+ indexed pages, 1B+ pageviews/year, 100M+ users/year), we have enough data to make meaningful innovations and a world-class in-house SEO team to partner with. Organic traffic is our lifeblood, so improving our understanding of search algorithms through measurement, experimentation, and modeling will improve our search rankings and, therefore, drive growth for the business.

Here are some ways you’ll make an impact!


Build a system of models that predicts each page’s crawl, indexation, search ranking, and traffic, controlling for endogenous site changes. The aggregation of this is a continually updating forecast of these KPIs for the business, and a synthetic control against which to evaluate experimental results.
Build an orthogonal model to validate the bottom-up simulation described above and summarize top-level domain health. Build anomaly detection routines that detect risks at all margins.
Work with SEO Strategists and peer Data Scientists to understand SEO best practices, propose strategic ideas, and develop measurement techniques. Build reusable analysis tools for sample sizing and post-test analysis; formulate hypotheses to improve model accuracy and conduct rigorous testing.
Discover and validate key performance metrics, for ourselves and competitors; develop models and datasets for synthetic control.
Propose experimentation strategies utilizing our primary coursehero.com domain and our dozens of other domains. Scale the above models to our other domains.


Are you our next Staff Data Scientist?


6+ years data science experience of continually increasing complexity and impact.
2+ years experience building forecasting and/or simulation models.
MS or PhD degree in an applicable quantitative field like Statistics, Math, Engineering, Science, Economics, Econometrics, Operations Research, Social Science, or similar.
Excellent proficiency in Python (or R), SQL skill, and an obsession with data breadth, depth, and quality. Propose and research new/additional data sources.
Deep understanding of statistics and probability, quantitative sciences, data analysis, predictive and ML modeling.
Strong problem-solving, detail orientation, and communication; a bias towards taking action quickly, making things happen, learning, and correcting course as you receive feedback.
Experience shipping large-scale inference models based on disparate data sources and non-obvious measurement techniques. This is both a research and an applied position.
Bonus: Knowledge of SEO, Brand Marketing Measurement, or similar hard-to-measure domains.


Benefits & Perks!


Competitive salary, annual bonus, and RSUs
Medical coverage, including full dental and vision
Life and disability benefits
401(k) program (US) / retirement savings plan (Canada) with company match
One month paid sabbatical after 5 years at the company
