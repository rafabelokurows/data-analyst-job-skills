We're on a mission to transform spoken communication for individuals, teams and organizations of any size. Meetings may be our most information-rich channel for work, but suffer from a lack of structure and documentation. At Supernormal, we're solving this problem with focus, design and craft.

We've been working on this since 2019 and have customers like Snap, Salesforce, Replay, Gitcoin, Pinterest and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we are growing rapidly and are excited for new teammates to join who are the best at what they do. We're passionately building a team that is as diverse and creative as the millions of people we serve worldwide.

Supernormal is a remote-first company and does not require co-location. We have annual team retreats and gather quarterly.

About The Role

Machine learning engineers at Supernormal build the AI that superpowers the core product experience for people's meetings including transcription, note generation, and task automation. The AI team builds reliable and secure services that use the most advanced AI models in the market to generate millions of high-quality meeting notes to a rapidly growing customer base. Our work revolves heavily around software engineering, too - we are looking for people with a drive to roll up their sleeves and get new models and features out to users as quickly as possible.

What You'll Work On

As an ML engineer on Supernormal's AI team, you will be responsible for the end-to-end development of our AI solutions for meeting notes, question answering, and task completion. Your work will encompass LLM API calls, custom model training and deployment, speech recognition, quality evaluation and fixes, retrieval augmented generation, and much more. You'll play a key role in optimizing for cost, latency, and quality. Some of the projects you'll work on include:


Prompt engineering using state-of-the-art techniques to improve the core meeting assistant scenarios
Building and shipping custom machine learning models to augment the AI stack, including improving transcript quality, reducing tokens sent to APIs, removing defects in LLM output, and extracting semi-structured data
Training and deploying custom large language models from open source using state-of-the-art techniques (LoRA, RLHF, instruction-tuning, etc)
Developing new product experiences using NLP & LLMs that get better based on user feedback & iteration while collaborating with product engineers & design team
Defining and improving business & product metrics to optimize the quality and cost of AI usage
Improving LLM-powered search and question answering (using RAG) over sets of meetings
Advocating for, and building, new and better ways of doing things. You'll leave everything you touch just a bit better than you found it



Requirements

What you will bring

We are a fast-moving startup building zero-to-one products on top of large language models. The ideal candidate has a strong machine learning background and a hacker mindset, someone who can both spin up Jupyter Notebooks to train models and also excel at writing solid, fast production code for deployment.


AI/ML Experience: Demonstrated proficiency in AI/ML with a track record of at least 3-5 years experience building machine learning systems, up to speed on the latest in NLP & LLMs, and proficient in data curation, modeling, and training models
A Solid Educational Foundation: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, AI, Mathematics, or related field; Master's degree or PhD a plus
Versatile Software Engineering Skills: A solid engineering background with a robust foundation in software engineering principles. You have written code for and supported production engineering systems.
Proficient in Python and SQL: our AI stack uses Python & PyTorch and interfaces with Ruby on Rails (bonus if you know it, but not required) and we write a lot of SQL queries on top of Snowflake to pull data


What we'll expect of you


A collaborative and open outlook — we're all about lifting each other up and getting better every day
A willingness to get deep into a problem even when it seems impossible. You'll always have support from the team
Confidence operating with high agency. We'll work together to decide what's important, but we'd love for you to bring (and build!) your own ideas
You'll come in willing to learn why things are the way they are, then suggest a better way
You'll understand that there's no difference between ""my idea"" and ""their idea."" It's our ideas and we're all responsible for it
You'll approach speed bumps and reviews through a ""how can the team level up?"" lens — let's all get better and learn, together



Benefits

💰 Competitive salary, 401K

📈 Stock options

🏥 Full healthcare coverage (Medical, Dental, and Vision)

🚀 Totally remote. Not hybrid. Remote. No return-to-office here

🏠 WFH budget to make sure you have everything you need to do your best work

Bachelors in Computer Science, Math, Physics, or other technical field, MS/PhD a plus
Comfortable with ambiguity and moving pieces - we're growing fast
Ability to communicate your analysis with clarity and precision to both technical and non-technical teams



PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS:

Experience with Git, code reviews, and coordination frameworks (e.g. Airflow)
Working knowledge of at least one modeling framework (e.g. scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
Experience with short, medium, and long-term forecasts to understand the likely growth trajectory of our company



Every Snowflake employee is expected to follow the company’s confidentiality and security standards for handling sensitive data. Snowflake employees must abide by the company’s data security plan as an essential part of their duties. It is every employee's duty to keep customer information secure and confidential.

The following represents the expected range of compensation for this role:


The estimated base salary range for this role is $180,000 - $276,000.
Additionally, this role is eligible to participate in Snowflake’s bonus and equity plan.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe’s mission is to build the economic infrastructure for the internet. Risk Engineering brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s financial and regulatory risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. We build ML and backend systems to catch fraudsters, understand users’ cash flow and financial health, and ensure Stripe’s users are compliant with regulatory and financial partner requirements. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from financial losses that can put Stripe’s business at risk.

The Risk group consists of machine learning, backend, and full stack engineers who tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We are undertaking several new efforts, where you can have an outsized impact on the architecture, implementation, and design choices behind these systems.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching models
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly reduce Stripe’s financial losses
Building systems that evaluate businesses for risk and take appropriate actions
Working with our partner teams to launch new policies that directly impact Stripe’s bottom line
Helping engineers across the company to develop technologies for scaling our infrastructure
Debugging production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 2 years of industry experience in training ML models
Enjoy and have experience shipping ML models in a large-scale production environment
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


Have experience in Python, Scala (Spark), or Ruby



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $157,300 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Ready to ? Who you are:


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

We're on a mission to transform spoken communication for individuals, teams and organizations of any size. Meetings may be our most information-rich channel for work, but suffer from a lack of structure and documentation. At Supernormal, we're solving this problem with focus, design and craft.

We've been working on this since 2019 and have customers like Snap, Salesforce, Replay, Gitcoin, Pinterest and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we are growing rapidly and are excited for new teammates to join who are the best at what they do. We're passionately building a team that is as diverse and creative as the millions of people we serve worldwide.

Supernormal is a remote-first company and does not require co-location. We have annual team retreats and gather quarterly.

About The Role

Machine learning engineers at Supernormal build the AI that superpowers the core product experience for people's meetings including transcription, note generation, and task automation. The AI team builds reliable and secure services that use the most advanced AI models in the market to generate millions of high-quality meeting notes to a rapidly growing customer base. Our work revolves heavily around software engineering, too - we are looking for people with a drive to roll up their sleeves and get new models and features out to users as quickly as possible.

What You'll Work On

As an ML engineer with a focus on modeling at Supernormal, you will specialize in developing and refining models that power our AI solutions for meeting notes, question answering, and task completion. Your expertise will be critical in LLM API calls, custom model training and deployment, speech recognition, quality evaluation and fixes, and retrieval augmented generation. You will primarily focus on optimizing model performance, cost, latency, and quality. Some of the projects you'll work on include:


Prompt engineering using state-of-the-art techniques to improve the core meeting assistant scenarios
Building and shipping custom machine learning models to augment the AI stack, including improving transcript quality, reducing tokens sent to APIs, removing defects in LLM output, and extracting semi-structured data
Training and deploying custom large language models from open source using state-of-the-art techniques (LoRA, RLHF, instruction-tuning, etc)
Specializing in model optimization to enhance performance and efficiency
Developing new product experiences using NLP & LLMs that get better based on user feedback & iteration while collaborating with product engineers & design team
Defining and improving business & product metrics to optimize the quality and cost of AI usage
Improving LLM-powered search and question answering (using RAG) over sets of meetings
Advocating for, and building, new and better ways of doing things. You'll leave everything you touch just a bit better than you found it



Requirements

What you will bring

We are a fast-moving startup building zero-to-one products on top of large language models. The ideal candidate is passionate about machine learning modeling, with a foundational understanding of algorithms and hands-on experience in developing and optimizing models. You exhibit proficiency in basic data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation, with a willingness to learn and grow in the field.


AI/ML Experience: 2-3 years of demonstrated experience working on real-world machine learning projects. This includes proficiency in developing and optimizing machine learning models, along with skills in model evaluation, validation, and tuning. Familiarity with handling large datasets, data preprocessing, and feature engineering is essential. Experience in deploying models into production environments and monitoring their performance is highly desirable
A Solid Educational Foundation: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, AI, Mathematics, or related field; Master's degree or PhD in related disciplines is a plus
Software Engineering Skills: Proficiency in software development principles and best practices, such as version control, code review, and testing. Experience with collaborative development tools and platforms, such as GitHub, is essential. Familiarity with Agile methodologies and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines is highly desirable
Proficient in Python and SQL: our AI stack uses Python & PyTorch and interfaces with Ruby on Rails (bonus if you know it, but not required) and we write a lot of SQL queries on top of Snowflake to pull data


What we'll expect of you


A collaborative and open outlook — we're all about lifting each other up and getting better every day
A willingness to get deep into a problem even when it seems impossible. You'll always have support from the team
Confidence operating with high agency. We'll work together to decide what's important, but we'd love for you to bring (and build!) your own ideas
You'll come in willing to learn why things are the way they are, then suggest a better way
You'll understand that there's no difference between ""my idea"" and ""their idea."" It's our ideas and we're all responsible for it
You'll approach speed bumps and reviews through a ""how can the team level up?"" lens — let's all get better and learn, together


What you can expect from us


We're a fully distributed team spread between Pacific Time (Seattle) and Central European Time (Stockholm) with lots of places in between. We'll see you most days in Slack, Google Meet, GitHub issues, and Notion. Sometimes in person in a place with a warm breeze
We're a friendly bunch and are happy to pair, talk through, or otherwise assist any time
Honest and timely feedback. We're all better when we can have candid conversations about what is and isn't working
A willingness to listen to your ideas: how can the codebase, our product, or team be better?
A respect for your time outside of work. We all work hard here, but we never forget to rest and have fun



Benefits

💰 Competitive salary, 401K

We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.

DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $136,000 - $160,000 per year.

We are helping our early stage (Pre-Seed -> Series B) portfolio companies grow their teams.

One of our portfolio companies is looking to hire a business-oriented data scientist to help accelerate their growth and product initiatives. They are focused on candidates with prior startup experience. They run a hybrid-work environment, and you will be expected to be in their office 3 days a week.

While being good at what you do are table stakes, we believe the following will make you successful in a startup:


Optimistic individuals are persistent, determined, and unwilling to give up in the face of adversity. They keep working towards a goal or objective despite setbacks or failures. Optimism often involves a combination of perseverance, resilience, and determination.
Growth-oriented individuals embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a key to success. They are willing to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. Growth-oriented individuals are curious, see learning as a lifelong process, and embrace feedback. They are willing to try new things, and are not afraid to change direction if something isn’t working.
Effective individuals collaborate well, work consistently and purposefully towards achieving their goals, efficiently manage their time, and are self-motivated. They are able to identify problems, analyze them critically, and develop effective solutions.


Please note that many early stage startups are unable to sponsor visas of any kinds (ie, no transfers, no sponsoring of student visas, or no sponsoring of new visas).

Nextdoor is where you connect to the neighborhoods that matter to you so you can belong. Our purpose is to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.

Neighbors around the world turn to Nextdoor daily to receive trusted information, give and get help, get things done, and build real-world connections with those nearby — neighbors, businesses, and public services. Today, neighbors rely on Nextdoor in more than 315,000 neighborhoods across 11 countries.

Meet Your Future Neighbors

Product finance, strategy and operations (“Product FSO”) is committed to driving growth through new user acquisition and increasing engagement amongst our existing user base of Neighbors. Today, we work closely with product and engineering teams to understand the impact and trends across growth and engagement while building and maintaining quarterly and long-range forecasts. Historically, we’ve been strong in our reporting and forecasting; however, are still building the bandwidth and capabilities to dive deeper into our data to better understand “why” we’re seeing what we’re seeing to subsequently get to “what” we should be doing about it.

We are looking for an entrepreneurial and driven Senior Data Scientist to build these Business Intelligence capabilities and establish the foundation of our data and analytics work. You will work closely with various cross-functional teams such as product, engineering, etc. to develop a BI layer and assist us in better understanding key metrics through causal analyses, data tooling, and dashboarding. Successful candidates will exhibit technical acumen, product sense and business savvy. You are passionate about leveraging the power of data to drive product changes with quality and agility. You are a team player.

At Nextdoor, we offer a warm and inclusive work environment that embraces a hybrid employment experience, providing a flexible experience for our valued employees.

The Impact You’ll Make

Role

The work of Product FSO is essential to the growth and success of the company and involves frequent opportunities to showcase key metrics and findings to senior leadership. In this role, you will:


Partner closely with Finance and ProdDev leads to identifying strategic, high-impact analytical problems and innovative ways to solve them with data
Insight discovery: Deliver data insights and drive for adoption through tools (e.g. dashboards, self-serve reporting), memos and presentations. Additionally, analyze data to identify trends, discrepancies, and opportunities for improvement. Provide actionable recommendations and insights to senior management to facilitate informed decision-making
Analytics and Forecasting: Conduct statistical analyses and modeling, exploratory/causal analysis, and metric development to uncover data insights that in turn better inform key decisions and enable driver-based forecasting of user activity.
Performance management support: Assist in our weekly performance tracking and management of business operations. Ensure accuracy and timeliness in performance reporting, helping the team meet its short and long-term objectives
Analytics foundation: Partner with our Analytics Engineering team to create and maintain a solid data foundation using advanced data analysis tools and techniques. Extract and manipulate large datasets to create meaningful metrics and insights that inform strategic decisions
Collaboration: Facilitate data ownership and accountability by closely partnering with data science, product, and engineering partners to improve data robustness
Participate in in-person Nextdoor events, trainings, off-sites, volunteer days, and other team building exercises
Build in-person relationships with team members and contribute to the KIND culture that Nextdoor values


What You’ll Bring To The Team


6 - 8+ years working in data science, product analytics, or business intelligence, or equivalent (starting level is flexible)
Strategic-minded, impact-driven, and capable of incorporating larger business context into data questions and product development
Experience architecting, debugging, and executing SQL queries
Excellent knowledge of Looker (preferred) or another BI/visualization tool
Comfortable knowledge of Python or R, including common scientific computing packages and data science tools such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn
Comfort with methods, tools, and packages for statistical modeling and machine learning
Experience formulating, running, and sharing complex analyses, including different types of experiments, cohort retention studies, and other exploratory analysis work
Intermediate knowledge of at least one big data technology such as Hive, Presto, or Spark
Excellent written and oral communication, including ability to effectively communicate complexity to a diverse group of stakeholders
Curiosity about how things work, from both a business and technical perspective
A self-starter who thrives under a high level of ambiguity and autonomy


It’s ok if you don’t have all of these requirements; if you think you’d be a good fit for the role, please get in touch with us!

Bonus Points


Past experience in solving problems in Finance or other business-facing areas
Work experience related to social or community-based products
Work experience related to small businesses and marketplaces
Work experience related to advertising and auction systems
Expertise deploying models to production
Expertise in testing and evaluating the impact of network effects
Knowledge of web applications and service-oriented architecture


Rewards

Compensation, benefits, perks, and recognition programs at Nextdoor come together to create one overall rewards package.

The starting salary for this role is expected to range from $175,000 to $210,000 on an annualized basis, or potentially greater in the event that your 'level' of proficiency exceeds the level expected for the role.

We also expect to award a meaningful equity grant for this role. With equal quarterly vesting, your first vest date would be within the first 3 months of your start date.

Overall, total compensation will vary depending on your relevant skills, experience, and qualifications. We have you covered! Nextdoor employees can choose between a variety of great health plans.

The following information aims to provide potential candidates with a better understanding of the requirements for this role.We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

About The Role:Notion's mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly expanding our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. As a marketing data scientist, you will play a critical role in accelerating Notion's growth by building and improving how we measure the impact of all our marketing efforts, such as brand campaigns and community. You will work closely with our marketing and engineering teams to make effective spending decisions across our marketing channels, recommend the most effective messaging and creatives from experiment design and analyses, and explore new opportunities for growing Notion's user base and business.

What You'll Achieve

You will build models to optimize our marketing efforts to make sure our marketing spend has the best possible ROI.

You will design, launch and analyze experiments to understand the incrementality of different messaging and creative campaigns.

You will apply your expertise in data mining and data presentation, as well as your knowledge of marketing channels and platforms, to identify opportunities for improving Notion's marketing strategy beyond the numbers.

You will partner closely with all marketing teams to make critical decisions about where we invest our marketing efforts, understanding the impact of our business, defining key success metrics and core segmentations.

You will influence your team's roadmap by sharing your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our marketing channel spend. (Insights are useful, but impact is even better!)

Skills You'll Need To Bring

You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with business functions ideally with paid marketing teams and having expertise in analyzing brand campaigns.

You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate your findings and recommendations to your partner teams.

You relish turning ambiguous questions and problems into clear deliverables and insights.

You are an expert in SQL and at least one of scripting languages such as R/Python.

You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the metrics and reporting you need don’t exist yet.

You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.

Nice To Haves

You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.

You Have Experience At a B2B SaaS Company.

You have solid experience working with marketing teams to drive decision-making.

About DoorDash

At DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.

DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

The following information aims to provide potential candidates with a better understanding of the requirements for this role.We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

About The Role:Notion's mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly expanding our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. As a marketing data scientist, you will play a critical role in accelerating Notion's growth by building and improving how we measure the impact of all our marketing efforts, such as brand campaigns and community. You will work closely with our marketing and engineering teams to make effective spending decisions across our marketing channels, recommend the most effective messaging and creatives from experiment design and analyses, and explore new opportunities for growing Notion's user base and business.

What You'll Achieve

You will build models to optimize our marketing efforts to make sure our marketing spend has the best possible ROI.

You will design, launch and analyze experiments to understand the incrementality of different messaging and creative campaigns.

You will apply your expertise in data mining and data presentation, as well as your knowledge of marketing channels and platforms, to identify opportunities for improving Notion's marketing strategy beyond the numbers.

You will partner closely with all marketing teams to make critical decisions about where we invest our marketing efforts, understanding the impact of our business, defining key success metrics and core segmentations.

You will influence your team's roadmap by sharing your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our marketing channel spend. (Insights are useful, but impact is even better!)

Skills You'll Need To Bring

You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with business functions ideally with paid marketing teams and having expertise in analyzing brand campaigns.

You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate your findings and recommendations to your partner teams.

You relish turning ambiguous questions and problems into clear deliverables and insights.

You are an expert in SQL and at least one of scripting languages such as R/Python.

You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the metrics and reporting you need don’t exist yet.

You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.

Nice To Haves

You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.

You Have Experience At a B2B SaaS Company.

You have solid experience working with marketing teams to drive decision-making.

We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

Who we are:

Shape a brighter financial future with us.

Together with our members, we’re changing the way people think about and interact with personal finance.

We’re a next-generation financial services company and national bank using innovative, mobile-first technology to help our millions of members reach their goals. The industry is going through an unprecedented transformation, and we’re at the forefront. We’re proud to come to work every day knowing that what we do has a direct impact on people’s lives, with our core values guiding us every step of the way. Join us to invest in yourself, your career, and the financial world.

The Role

We are seeking a full stack Senior Data Scientist who will help shape business strategy and product development decisions through data-driven insights. This is an exciting role for someone to make a direct impact on new product strategy and revenue of SoFi, supporting SoFi’s B2B business channel called SoFi At Work. The goal of this platform is to provide new ways for our partners to help their employees get their money right across every life stage.

Success in this role hinges on your technical aptitude, quantitative abilities, and business acumen: you know how to plow through data with SQL/Python/R/Tableau, surface insights using math/statistics/ML techniques, and measure the business impact using efficiency/conversion/profit metrics. You treat stakeholders as a partnership – you are there at each step of the way and you know that we only succeed if we succeed together.

This role

What you’ll do:



Work with amazing product and business managers to identify strategic opportunities, measure KPIs to craft compelling stories, make data-driven recommendations, and drive informed actions.
Craft, analyze, and present customer behavior metrics, such as funnel conversion, user churn, features engagement, product LTV, and cross-sell metrics. Work with product and marketing partners to design tests to improve these metrics.
Own end-to-end product analytics workflow including formulating success metrics, socializing them across the organization, and creating dashboards/reports.
Act as a curator of data by defining, instrumenting, and tracking necessary analytics of our products by working cross functionally with engineering and product teams.
Build self-service systems to enable others in the organization to leverage your work.
Analyze and perform statistical analysis on data that underlies product experiments.
Build models to help decision makers understand customer behaviors and segmentation
You stay focused on what’s best for the company – sometimes that requires being flexible, other times it requires being steadfast.



What you’ll need:



Bachelor’s degree required (Masters preferred) in Computer Science, Math, Physics, Engineering or quantitative field.
4+ years of relevant work experience
Intellectual curiosity and aptitude to pick up new technical skills
Exceptional problem-solving skills
Ability to initiate and drive projects to completion with minimal guidance
High EQ with ability to influence outcomes and communicate technical content to general audiences
Strong programming skills in SQL, Python and proficiency in Tableau
Experience with experimentation and hypothesis testing
Ability to work in a dynamic, cross-functional environment, with strong attention to detail
Strong relationship building and collaborative skills
Experience with using DBT/Airflow to build Data Pipelines in Snowflake

Nextdoor is where you connect to the neighborhoods that matter to you so you can belong. Our purpose is to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.

Neighbors around the world turn to Nextdoor daily to receive trusted information, give and get help, get things done, and build real-world connections with those nearby — neighbors, businesses, and public services. Today, neighbors rely on Nextdoor in more than 315,000 neighborhoods across 11 countries.

Meet Your Future Neighbors

Product finance, strategy and operations (“Product FSO”) is committed to driving growth through new user acquisition and increasing engagement amongst our existing user base of Neighbors. Today, we work closely with product and engineering teams to understand the impact and trends across growth and engagement while building and maintaining quarterly and long-range forecasts. Historically, we’ve been strong in our reporting and forecasting; however, are still building the bandwidth and capabilities to dive deeper into our data to better understand “why” we’re seeing what we’re seeing to subsequently get to “what” we should be doing about it.

We are looking for an entrepreneurial and driven Senior Data Scientist to build these Business Intelligence capabilities and establish the foundation of our data and analytics work. You will work closely with various cross-functional teams such as product, engineering, etc. to develop a BI layer and assist us in better understanding key metrics through causal analyses, data tooling, and dashboarding. Successful candidates will exhibit technical acumen, product sense and business savvy. You are passionate about leveraging the power of data to drive product changes with quality and agility. You are a team player.

At Nextdoor, we offer a warm and inclusive work environment that embraces a hybrid employment experience, providing a flexible experience for our valued employees.

The Impact You’ll Make

Role

The work of Product FSO is essential to the growth and success of the company and involves frequent opportunities to showcase key metrics and findings to senior leadership. In this role, you will:


Partner closely with Finance and ProdDev leads to identifying strategic, high-impact analytical problems and innovative ways to solve them with data
Insight discovery: Deliver data insights and drive for adoption through tools (e.g. dashboards, self-serve reporting), memos and presentations. Additionally, analyze data to identify trends, discrepancies, and opportunities for improvement. Provide actionable recommendations and insights to senior management to facilitate informed decision-making
Analytics and Forecasting: Conduct statistical analyses and modeling, exploratory/causal analysis, and metric development to uncover data insights that in turn better inform key decisions and enable driver-based forecasting of user activity.
Performance management support: Assist in our weekly performance tracking and management of business operations. Ensure accuracy and timeliness in performance reporting, helping the team meet its short and long-term objectives
Analytics foundation: Partner with our Analytics Engineering team to create and maintain a solid data foundation using advanced data analysis tools and techniques. Extract and manipulate large datasets to create meaningful metrics and insights that inform strategic decisions
Collaboration: Facilitate data ownership and accountability by closely partnering with data science, product, and engineering partners to improve data robustness
Participate in in-person Nextdoor events, trainings, off-sites, volunteer days, and other team building exercises
Build in-person relationships with team members and contribute to the KIND culture that Nextdoor values


What You’ll Bring To The Team


6 - 8+ years working in data science, product analytics, or business intelligence, or equivalent (starting level is flexible)
Strategic-minded, impact-driven, and capable of incorporating larger business context into data questions and product development
Experience architecting, debugging, and executing SQL queries
Excellent knowledge of Looker (preferred) or another BI/visualization tool
Comfortable knowledge of Python or R, including common scientific computing packages and data science tools such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn
Comfort with methods, tools, and packages for statistical modeling and machine learning
Experience formulating, running, and sharing complex analyses, including different types of experiments, cohort retention studies, and other exploratory analysis work
Intermediate knowledge of at least one big data technology such as Hive, Presto, or Spark
Excellent written and oral communication, including ability to effectively communicate complexity to a diverse group of stakeholders
Curiosity about how things work, from both a business and technical perspective
A self-starter who thrives under a high level of ambiguity and autonomy


It’s ok if you don’t have all of these requirements; if you think you’d be a good fit for the role, please get in touch with us!

Bonus Points


Past experience in solving problems in Finance or other business-facing areas
Work experience related to social or community-based products
Work experience related to small businesses and marketplaces
Work experience related to advertising and auction systems
Expertise deploying models to production
Expertise in testing and evaluating the impact of network effects
Knowledge of web applications and service-oriented architecture

The starting salary for this role is expected to range from $175,000 to $210,000 on an annualized basis, or potentially greater in the event that your 'level' of proficiency exceeds the level expected for the role.

We also expect to award a meaningful equity grant for this role. With equal quarterly vesting, your first vest date would be within the first 3 months of your start date.

Who we are:

Shape a brighter financial future with us.

Together with our members, we’re changing the way people think about and interact with personal finance.

We’re a next-generation financial services company and national bank using innovative, mobile-first technology to help our millions of members reach their goals. The industry is going through an unprecedented transformation, and we’re at the forefront. We’re proud to come to work every day knowing that what we do has a direct impact on people’s lives, with our core values guiding us every step of the way. Join us to invest in yourself, your career, and the financial world.

The Role

We are seeking a full stack Senior Data Scientist who will help shape business strategy and product development decisions through data-driven insights. This is an exciting role for someone to make a direct impact on new product strategy and revenue of SoFi, supporting SoFi’s B2B business channel called SoFi At Work. The goal of this platform is to provide new ways for our partners to help their employees get their money right across every life stage.

Success in this role hinges on your technical aptitude, quantitative abilities, and business acumen: you know how to plow through data with SQL/Python/R/Tableau, surface insights using math/statistics/ML techniques, and measure the business impact using efficiency/conversion/profit metrics. You treat stakeholders as a partnership – you are there at each step of the way and you know that we only succeed if we succeed together.

This role

What you’ll do:



Work with amazing product and business managers to identify strategic opportunities, measure KPIs to craft compelling stories, make data-driven recommendations, and drive informed actions.
Craft, analyze, and present customer behavior metrics, such as funnel conversion, user churn, features engagement, product LTV, and cross-sell metrics. Work with product and marketing partners to design tests to improve these metrics.
Own end-to-end product analytics workflow including formulating success metrics, socializing them across the organization, and creating dashboards/reports.
Act as a curator of data by defining, instrumenting, and tracking necessary analytics of our products by working cross functionally with engineering and product teams.
Build self-service systems to enable others in the organization to leverage your work.
Analyze and perform statistical analysis on data that underlies product experiments.
Build models to help decision makers understand customer behaviors and segmentation
You stay focused on what’s best for the company – sometimes that requires being flexible, other times it requires being steadfast.



What you’ll need:



Bachelor’s degree required (Masters preferred) in Computer Science, Math, Physics, Engineering or quantitative field.
4+ years of relevant work experience
Intellectual curiosity and aptitude to pick up new technical skills
Exceptional problem-solving skills
Ability to initiate and drive projects to completion with minimal guidance
High EQ with ability to influence outcomes and communicate technical content to general audiences
Strong programming skills in SQL, Python and proficiency in Tableau
Experience with experimentation and hypothesis testing
Ability to work in a dynamic, cross-functional environment, with strong attention to detail
Strong relationship building and collaborative skills
Experience with using DBT/Airflow to build Data Pipelines in Snowflake

Nextdoor is where you connect to the neighborhoods that matter to you so you can belong. Our purpose is to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.

Neighbors around the world turn to Nextdoor daily to receive trusted information, give and get help, get things done, and build real-world connections with those nearby — neighbors, businesses, and public services. Today, neighbors rely on Nextdoor in more than 315,000 neighborhoods across 11 countries.

Meet Your Future Neighbors

Product finance, strategy and operations (“Product FSO”) is committed to driving growth through new user acquisition and increasing engagement amongst our existing user base of Neighbors. Today, we work closely with product and engineering teams to understand the impact and trends across growth and engagement while building and maintaining quarterly and long-range forecasts. Historically, we’ve been strong in our reporting and forecasting; however, are still building the bandwidth and capabilities to dive deeper into our data to better understand “why” we’re seeing what we’re seeing to subsequently get to “what” we should be doing about it.

We are looking for an entrepreneurial and driven Senior Data Scientist to build these Business Intelligence capabilities and establish the foundation of our data and analytics work. You will work closely with various cross-functional teams such as product, engineering, etc. to develop a BI layer and assist us in better understanding key metrics through causal analyses, data tooling, and dashboarding. Successful candidates will exhibit technical acumen, product sense and business savvy. You are passionate about leveraging the power of data to drive product changes with quality and agility. You are a team player.

At Nextdoor, we offer a warm and inclusive work environment that embraces a hybrid employment experience, providing a flexible experience for our valued employees.

The Impact You’ll Make

Role

The work of Product FSO is essential to the growth and success of the company and involves frequent opportunities to showcase key metrics and findings to senior leadership. In this role, you will:


Partner closely with Finance and ProdDev leads to identifying strategic, high-impact analytical problems and innovative ways to solve them with data
Insight discovery: Deliver data insights and drive for adoption through tools (e.g. dashboards, self-serve reporting), memos and presentations. Additionally, analyze data to identify trends, discrepancies, and opportunities for improvement. Provide actionable recommendations and insights to senior management to facilitate informed decision-making
Analytics and Forecasting: Conduct statistical analyses and modeling, exploratory/causal analysis, and metric development to uncover data insights that in turn better inform key decisions and enable driver-based forecasting of user activity.
Performance management support: Assist in our weekly performance tracking and management of business operations. Ensure accuracy and timeliness in performance reporting, helping the team meet its short and long-term objectives
Analytics foundation: Partner with our Analytics Engineering team to create and maintain a solid data foundation using advanced data analysis tools and techniques. Extract and manipulate large datasets to create meaningful metrics and insights that inform strategic decisions
Collaboration: Facilitate data ownership and accountability by closely partnering with data science, product, and engineering partners to improve data robustness
Participate in in-person Nextdoor events, trainings, off-sites, volunteer days, and other team building exercises
Build in-person relationships with team members and contribute to the KIND culture that Nextdoor values


What You’ll Bring To The Team


6 - 8+ years working in data science, product analytics, or business intelligence, or equivalent (starting level is flexible)
Strategic-minded, impact-driven, and capable of incorporating larger business context into data questions and product development
Experience architecting, debugging, and executing SQL queries
Excellent knowledge of Looker (preferred) or another BI/visualization tool
Comfortable knowledge of Python or R, including common scientific computing packages and data science tools such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn
Comfort with methods, tools, and packages for statistical modeling and machine learning
Experience formulating, running, and sharing complex analyses, including different types of experiments, cohort retention studies, and other exploratory analysis work
Intermediate knowledge of at least one big data technology such as Hive, Presto, or Spark
Excellent written and oral communication, including ability to effectively communicate complexity to a diverse group of stakeholders
Curiosity about how things work, from both a business and technical perspective
A self-starter who thrives under a high level of ambiguity and autonomy


It’s ok if you don’t have all of these requirements; if you think you’d be a good fit for the role, please get in touch with us!

Bonus Points


Past experience in solving problems in Finance or other business-facing areas
Work experience related to social or community-based products
Work experience related to small businesses and marketplaces
Work experience related to advertising and auction systems
Expertise deploying models to production
Expertise in testing and evaluating the impact of network effects
Knowledge of web applications and service-oriented architecture


Rewards

Compensation, benefits, perks, and recognition programs at Nextdoor come together to create one overall rewards package.

The starting salary for this role is expected to range from $175,000 to $210,000 on an annualized basis, or potentially greater in the event that your 'level' of proficiency exceeds the level expected for the role.

We also expect to award a meaningful equity grant for this role. With equal quarterly vesting, your first vest date would be within the first 3 months of your start date.

Overall, total compensation will vary depending on your relevant skills, experience, and qualifications. We have you covered! Nextdoor employees can choose between a variety of great health plans.

          <p><strong>ABOUT DESCARTES UNDERWRITING </strong></p><p>Descartes was born out of the conviction that the ever-increasing complexity of risks faced by corporations, governments and vulnerable communities calls for a renewed approach in insurance. Our team brings together industry veterans from the most renowned institutions (AXA, SCOR, Swiss Re, Marsh, Aon, ...) and scientists on top of their field to bring underwriting excellence. After 5 years of existence, Descartes has secured a leading position in parametric insurance for weather and climate-related risks utilizing machine learning, real-time monitoring from satellite imagery &amp; IoT. After a successful Series B raise of $120M USD, we launched Descartes Insurance, a 'full stack' insurer licensed to underwrite risk by the French regulator ACPR. With a growing corporate client base (350+ and counting), our diverse team is headquartered in Paris and operates out of our 13 global offices in North America, Europe, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan.

Through smart collaboration, we have delivered over 40 (Gen)AI projects in the last two years for our clients in Retail, Healthcare and Financial Services. As a Data Scientist, you will play a central role in truly understanding our client’s needs, translating this into value, creating solutions, developing Gen(AI) models and turning them into action. We believe it is key to have business sense as well as broad experience with data related topics (analytics, artificial intelligence, etc.) to create real business value. On top of that, you need to be able to communicate clearly and convincingly. Not only for effective project execution, but also to inspire (internal) stakeholders on the latest trends and developments in the field of Data and AI.

You will typically work in multidisciplinary project teams for one project at a time. Although being able to deliver work independently is appreciated, involvement of a project manager and technical experts ensures high-quality delivery and facilitates you to maintain a steep learning curve. We believe in diverse teams and diverse profiles in our Data & AI team. Some of our Data Scientists develop to be great consultants with technical knowledge and execution power, while others focus more on gaining deep technical expertise to deliver value from there. Working on a different range of projects in different sectors, you’ll be able to find your own sweet spot.

In addition, we believe that a caring and fun working environment will help you to dare to step out of your comfort zone and learn. We offer continuous learning through the IG&H Academy, in which you will get trainings to boost your data science, consulting and people skills. Also, you will be assigned a mentor, who will be there for you to provide you with guidance.

Above all, people are at the heart of what we do. This of course comes back in the work we deliver for our clients (why make a data product if the people who need to use it do not understand or want to use it?). At the same time, a fun working culture is key for who we are. With an inspiring office in Utrecht where we can connect, have abundant parties, team activities and sport events (both organized for the entire IG&H organization as well as specifically for the Data & Analytics team), IG&H is truly a Great Place To Work. And yes, we are certified!

Working for the Data & AI Team at IG&H Consulting is incredibly diverse, and fun at the same time. It’s been a great place to develop my technical know-how, management consulting skills and commercial effectivity. The team is young and ambitious, with a strong desire to solve complex puzzles, develop personally & professionally and do fun activities together. All in all, IG&H has been a great place to work for over 6 years already!

Wil jij ons helpen om big data een rol in het politiewerk te laten spelen?

Wat ga je doen?

De digitalisering van de maatschappij heeft grote maatschappelijke effecten en biedt kansen voor het aanpakken van maatschappelijke vraagstukken. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is één van de technologieën die in hoog tempo wordt ontwikkeld en toegepast. Voor de politie biedt AI kansen om haar taak effectief uit te blijven voeren en om efficiënter te werken. De politie heeft AI dan ook aangemerkt als een van de sleuteltechnologieën die van belang is voor innovatie en de ontwikkeling van de organisatie.

Als junior data scientist bij Team Wetenschappelijke Ontwikkelingen (TWO) ga je de politieoperatie ondersteunen met behulp van AI. Dit doe je (onder andere) door wetenschappelijk onderzoek, dat wordt gedaan door promovendi bij het AI-lab, toe te passen op de politieoperatie. Daarnaast toon je initiatief om aan projecten, die vanuit de operatie komen, mee te werken en hierin de juiste data science of AI-oplossing toe te passen. Je gaat werken met verschillende soorten data zoals beeld en tekst. Hierin ben je op zoek naar nieuwe mogelijkheden en technieken om zo goed mogelijke resultaten te bereiken.

Het data wetenschappelijk werk is nog volop in ontwikkeling bij de politie. Daarom is het mogelijk dat er ook aanpalende werkzaamheden moeten worden verricht zoals data preparatie of business analyse.

Waar ga je werken?

Het Nationaal Politielab AI (NPAI) bestaat uit verschillende onderdelen. Een deel wat zich focust op wetenschappelijk onderzoek waar promovendi werkzaam zijn en het Team Wetenschappelijke Ontwikkelingen (TWO).

Wetenschappelijk onderzoek is de samenwerking van de politie met verschillende universiteiten (Universiteit Utrecht, de Universiteit van Amsterdam, en de TU Delft). Het doel van dit deel van het Politielab AI, is om samen met de wetenschap kennis op te bouwen en verantwoorde toepassingen te realiseren voor de politie met state-of-the-art AI. Hiertoe werken meerdere master studenten, promovendi (oftewel PhD-kandidaten), onderzoekers, postdocs en senior wetenschappers (waaronder hoogleraren) samen. Het wetenschappelijk onderzoek binnen het Politielab AI heeft een centrale rol in de ontwikkeling van AI binnen de politie. Op dit moment werken negentien promovendi in de wetenschappelijke tak van het Politielab.

Jij gaat werken bij Team Wetenschappelijke Ontwikkelingen. De primaire taak is de overdracht faciliteren van onderzoeken van promovendi naar inzet binnen de politie. Er werken momenteel elf medewerkers bij TWO.

Het TWO heeft een aantal taken


het vertalen van onderzoeksresultaten naar de operatie. Hiermee vormt TWO de brug tussen het wetenschappelijk onderzoek en de inzet binnen de politie.
het opbouwen (op basis van de onderzoeksagenda) van kennis en het maken van “verantwoorde” toepassingen (concepten) waar anderen middels experimenten op doorontwikkelen zoals de Dienst ICT en het programma Digitalisering.
het, waar nodig, begeleiden van experimenten en proeftuinen die onder leiding van het programma Digitalisering plaatsvinden.


Wie ben jij?

Als junior data scientist combineer jij je kennis van data en verschillende technieken met je enthousiasme om dit toe te passen binnen de politie. Je bent leergierig en vindt het belangrijk om bij te blijven in je vakgebied. Ook ben je proactief en waar je kansen ziet spreek je dit uit. Je weet dit te vertalen naar mogelijke nieuwe projecten om je collega’s te ondersteunen. Daarnaast vind je het belangrijk om in verbinding te staan met zowel de operationele collega’s als met mede data scientists. Met beide collega’s kun je goed communiceren en samenwerken. Hierdoor krijg je een goed beeld van de zaken die spelen en voor welke problemen bestaande oplossingen kunnen worden toegepast.

Daarnaast beschik je over


hbo werk- en denkniveau* bij voorkeur in een technische specialisatie zoals Artifical Intelligence, Data Science, Business Analytics, Computer Science of vergelijkbaar;
kennis met het toepassen van verschillende data science en AI toepassingen;
kennis en ervaring met Python;
werkervaring bij een (grote) overheidsinstelling, bij voorkeur in het veiligheidsdomein;
werkervaring in het opzetten van AI projecten en verandervraagstukken.
het is een pre als je beschikt over ervaring met Git, Kubernetes, CI/CD (devops), graph databases en Test Driven Development (TDD).

What you will do & what we offer

The mission of Scibids is to provide media buyers with fully automated buying strategies for display campaigns, leading to uncompared performances for a minimum of human work.

As a DataScientist, your role will be to evaluate and improve ""Scibids DoubleVerify"" bidding algorithms, which are Scibids main asset, and to actively participate into Scibids automation and development process: each business case not yet automatically handled by our product should be met by the corresponding product improvement. This position will combine analytical rigor, a relentless curiosity, a strong knowledge of statistical methods and experience in implementing them.

This position will combine high development standards, a relentless curiosity, a strong understanding of business priorities and the ambition for your work to become a real game changer!

On a day to day basis, your responsibilities will include:


working with massive datasets (billions of ads impressions/month) and millions of variables.
solving non-routine analysis problems (not handled by off-the-shelf ML solvers).


solving challenging scaling/engineering problems as our system produces thousands of ML models per day.


working closely with the commercial and customer success team and help identify the business cases where a new algorithm is needed/existing ones need improvement.
identify and automate any repetitive process taking place at Scibids, including cases where this means developing some AI routines replacing “human common sense”.


Qualifications

Minimum qualifications:


MS degree in applied mathematics (e.g., statistics, probabilities, operations research, machine learning).
Work / academic projects experience in data analysis or related field (e.g., as a statistician/data scientist) with actual algorithms implementation in an industry programming language (eg Python, C++...)


Preferred Qualifications


Professional/academic experience in a SQL-like language.


Technical stack relevant to the position


Python
SQL
Kubernetes, Docker, Github
Google Cloud Environment, App Engine Standard, Cloud SQL, Google Cloud Datastore...


Cultural fit


Do things only once. No repetitive task survives ingenuity and automation: at Scibids, everything needs to scale!
Base your decisions on data points. Preconceived personal convictions rarely survive thorough confrontation with actual data.
Work in a team and be curious. Every Scibids member has stock-options and is focused on the same objective: make Scibids the next adtech unicorn! This means being interested in how one’s daily personal work fits in Scibids general strategy and having in mind the greater good of the company rather than individual accomplishments.
Have a good laugh. We are a young, hard-working team with huge ambitions: nothing wipes off long hours of work better than sharing a drink with the team!


Others


Contract type: full-time position (French “CDI”).
Based in Paris (75008) – Champs-Elysées

Wil jij ons helpen om big data een rol in het politiewerk te laten spelen?

Wat ga je doen?

De digitalisering van de maatschappij heeft grote maatschappelijke effecten en biedt kansen voor het aanpakken van maatschappelijke vraagstukken. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is één van de technologieën die in hoog tempo wordt ontwikkeld en toegepast. Voor de politie biedt AI kansen om haar taak effectief uit te blijven voeren en om efficiënter te werken. De politie heeft AI dan ook aangemerkt als een van de sleuteltechnologieën die van belang is voor innovatie en de ontwikkeling van de organisatie.

Als junior data scientist bij Team Wetenschappelijke Ontwikkelingen (TWO) ga je de politieoperatie ondersteunen met behulp van AI. Dit doe je (onder andere) door wetenschappelijk onderzoek, dat wordt gedaan door promovendi bij het AI-lab, toe te passen op de politieoperatie. Daarnaast toon je initiatief om aan projecten, die vanuit de operatie komen, mee te werken en hierin de juiste data science of AI-oplossing toe te passen. Je gaat werken met verschillende soorten data zoals beeld en tekst. Hierin ben je op zoek naar nieuwe mogelijkheden en technieken om zo goed mogelijke resultaten te bereiken.

Het data wetenschappelijk werk is nog volop in ontwikkeling bij de politie. Daarom is het mogelijk dat er ook aanpalende werkzaamheden moeten worden verricht zoals data preparatie of business analyse.

Waar ga je werken?

Het Nationaal Politielab AI (NPAI) bestaat uit verschillende onderdelen. Een deel wat zich focust op wetenschappelijk onderzoek waar promovendi werkzaam zijn en het Team Wetenschappelijke Ontwikkelingen (TWO).

Wetenschappelijk onderzoek is de samenwerking van de politie met verschillende universiteiten (Universiteit Utrecht, de Universiteit van Amsterdam, en de TU Delft). Het doel van dit deel van het Politielab AI, is om samen met de wetenschap kennis op te bouwen en verantwoorde toepassingen te realiseren voor de politie met state-of-the-art AI. Hiertoe werken meerdere master studenten, promovendi (oftewel PhD-kandidaten), onderzoekers, postdocs en senior wetenschappers (waaronder hoogleraren) samen. Het wetenschappelijk onderzoek binnen het Politielab AI heeft een centrale rol in de ontwikkeling van AI binnen de politie. Op dit moment werken negentien promovendi in de wetenschappelijke tak van het Politielab.

Jij gaat werken bij Team Wetenschappelijke Ontwikkelingen. De primaire taak is de overdracht faciliteren van onderzoeken van promovendi naar inzet binnen de politie. Er werken momenteel elf medewerkers bij TWO.

Het TWO heeft een aantal taken


het vertalen van onderzoeksresultaten naar de operatie. Hiermee vormt TWO de brug tussen het wetenschappelijk onderzoek en de inzet binnen de politie.
het opbouwen (op basis van de onderzoeksagenda) van kennis en het maken van “verantwoorde” toepassingen (concepten) waar anderen middels experimenten op doorontwikkelen zoals de Dienst ICT en het programma Digitalisering.
het, waar nodig, begeleiden van experimenten en proeftuinen die onder leiding van het programma Digitalisering plaatsvinden.


Wie ben jij?

Als junior data scientist combineer jij je kennis van data en verschillende technieken met je enthousiasme om dit toe te passen binnen de politie. Je bent leergierig en vindt het belangrijk om bij te blijven in je vakgebied. Ook ben je proactief en waar je kansen ziet spreek je dit uit. Je weet dit te vertalen naar mogelijke nieuwe projecten om je collega’s te ondersteunen. Daarnaast vind je het belangrijk om in verbinding te staan met zowel de operationele collega’s als met mede data scientists. Met beide collega’s kun je goed communiceren en samenwerken. Hierdoor krijg je een goed beeld van de zaken die spelen en voor welke problemen bestaande oplossingen kunnen worden toegepast.

Daarnaast beschik je over


hbo werk- en denkniveau* bij voorkeur in een technische specialisatie zoals Artifical Intelligence, Data Science, Business Analytics, Computer Science of vergelijkbaar;
kennis met het toepassen van verschillende data science en AI toepassingen;
kennis en ervaring met Python;
werkervaring bij een (grote) overheidsinstelling, bij voorkeur in het veiligheidsdomein;
werkervaring in het opzetten van AI projecten en verandervraagstukken.
het is een pre als je beschikt over ervaring met Git, Kubernetes, CI/CD (devops), graph databases en Test Driven Development (TDD).


Wat wij bieden

De standplaats is Nieuwegein. Er is ruimte voor 1 fte. Het betreft een functie voor 36 uur per week. Omdat goede mensen belangrijk zijn binnen de politie investeren we in jouw toekomst. We bieden uitgebreide ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden en een aanstelling in tijdelijke dienst voor een proeftijd van een jaar. Bij voldoende functioneren wordt de aanstelling na een jaar omgezet in een vaste aanstelling.

Verder kun je het volgende van ons verwachten


een bruto maandsalaris van minimaal € 3.484,- en maximaal € 5.489,- (schaal 10 Bbp) op basis van een 36-urige werkweek;
