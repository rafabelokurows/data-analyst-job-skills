Energiewirtschaftliche Exzellenz aus mehr als 30 Jahren LBD-Beratungs- und Projekterfahrung übersetzen wir dabei in standardisierte Softwarelösungen Mithilfe geodatenbasierter Algorithmik – in Form eines digitalen Zwillings der realen Welt digitalisieren wir den Infrastrukturumbau.

Für die kommunale Wärmeplanung bieten wir unsere Software INFRA Planungs- und Ingenieurbüros als SaaS-Lösung an. Energieversorger unterstützen wir ganzheitlich mit teils individuellen Enterprise-Lösungen. Für die damit verbundenen Aufgaben brauchen wir Menschen, die den Startup-Geist in sich tragen und Lust haben, unser Geschäft und den noch jungen Markt der digitalen Wärmeplanung maßgeblich mitzugestalten.

Wir suchen dich als Data Scientist (m/w/d) für die digitale Wärmeplanung

Gemeinsam mit dem LBD-Team „Digital“ stellst du dich der Herausforderung, uns als Unternehmen sowie unsere Kunden und Partner aus dem Bereich der „Digitalen Wärmeplanung“ dazu zu befähigen, ein datengetriebenes Unternehmen zu werden.

Aufgaben


Du entwickelst und pflegst Routinen zur Metadaten­ex­tra­ktion aus Mediendaten.
Du erstellst und verwaltest Jobs zur automatischen Daten­verarbeitung für Raster- und Vektordatensätze (z.B. reprojection, merging, photogrammetry).
Du konzipierst, entwickelst und betreibst (Geo-)Daten­banken und darauf aufbauende (Geo-)APIs
Du entwickelst mit dem Team effiziente und durch­dachte End-To-End Lösungen in einer dynamischen und agilen Arbeitsumgebung nach der Scrum-Methode.

Du bringst eine starke Affinität für Daten, Daten­struk­turen, -prozesse und Algorithmen mit, hast demnach ein sehr ausgeprägtes analytisches Denk­ver­mögen. Zu­dem kommt Dein besonderes Interesse, Deine Eigen­schaften und Fähigkeiten in gesellschaftlich aktuelle wie hochrelevante Themen­gebiete, wie z. B. der „Energie- und Wärmewende“ gewinnbringend einzubringen.
Du verfügst über umfassende Fachkenntnisse zur An­wen­­dung von GIS-Systemen (QGIS) und bringst idealer­weise auch profunde Berufserfahrung in der Durch­führung von GIS-Projekten
Du bringst fundierte Vorerfahrung mit Python und eine Leidenschaft für sauberes Design mit.
Du hast bereits mit verschiedenen Datenbanktypen gear­beitet (Geo, SQL, NoSQL, Vektor) und das Wissen darüber, wann welche Art der Technologie sinnvoll eingesetzt werden kann und wie die Datenhaltung und Zugriffe effizient und sicher gestaltet werden können.

About the New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt, the best place to order groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, and other retail goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!) 🚀

About The New Verticals Analytics Team

Our New Verticals Analytics team sits at the intersection of product development, strategic planning, and operational execution. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design, and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions, to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience that combines scientific expertise with stakeholder engagement. When you join this team, you will be taking ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from the ground up, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we want you on our team.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
4+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis using statistical software packages in Python or R.
Expertise in causal inference (Diff in Diff, Synthetic control).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Our Story

At Wooga, we are very proud of the diverse, creative and friendly environment we have established and we believe you will enjoy working with some of the best people in the industry. Each of our Woogas plays an important role in our success as a company and in shaping our culture. We really value our razor-sharp focus on story-driven casual games, excellent craftsmanship, truly collaborative way of working, and the values we strive to live up to every day. We create joyful experiences that awaken our players' desire to see what happens next. Based in the heart of Berlin, with over 300 employees from around the world, we work together to create high-quality casual games with engaging stories at the core of the experience.

About the role

At Wooga, our Data Scientists play an instrumental role in driving the successful development of our games. The Data Science team explores new methodologies and delves deep into every aspect of our data to identify opportunities and make a real impact on our business. We are looking for a data enthusiast, who is passionate about games and can think analytically about what makes a game great!


You will lead analytics projects involving multiple team members to understand, segment, predict and influence the behaviour of our players across our games portfolio
You will build data tools for our product managers, empowering them to deliver actionable insights and recommendations for our game teams
You will use experiments, advanced analytics and ML to find levers for product optimization
You will proactively drive improvements of and provide education on our analytics tools
You will help coach and train more junior members of the team in both technical and soft skills


About you

Here at Wooga, the desire to learn and the willingness to solve problems are more important to us than your experience on paper. We encourage you to apply even if you do not think that you tick all the boxes - thinking outside of such boxes and embracing the diversity of mindsets and backgrounds is what we believe makes our teams thrive.

MORE THAN A JOB:

Blacklane is a scale-up started in 2011, founded by Jens Wohltorf and Frank Steuer who wanted to create the first global chauffeur service. We started by filling chauffeurs' 'empty leg' journeys and have grown with our partners to over €100 million in annual revenue (pre-pandemic). Backed by Daimler and other investors in Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the UAE, we're now a trusted brand within corporate travel.

We believe in ethical business practices and have a strong company culture. Responding to the pandemic, we've successfully managed the crises and retained our talented crew! We are now poised for massive growth in 2021.


Continuous Learning: We believe that open and actionable feedback is the essential component of continuous development. Set your personal development plan and take an active role in our internal learning communities to progress your career.
Flexible Working: Even the most ambitious Blacklaner needs some time to unwind. Find out what works for you and your team with flexible working hours and home office days (working from home is the new normal).
Become Part of the Crew: Get to know your fellow Blacklaners through our regular team socials. Our success comes from a collaboration of more than 350 people from 70 nations and we are looking for more exceptional people to join us!
Employee Stock Options Plan: We want all Blacklaners to benefit from the company's success, so every employee gets virtual stock options.
Fair Remuneration: We've banded salary levels and matched them to the local costs of living, meaning you're always paid fairly and you know that the rest of the crew is too.
Sustainability: We care for both people and the planet, having launched the mobility's industry first global carbon offset scheme in 2017. Blacklane has pledged to deliver 75% of its journeys in electric vehicles by 2025.
Equal Opportunity: We are committed to inclusion and diversity. A company is only as strong as its crew, so we developed a work environment that is inclusive, inspiring and open. All qualified applicants receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

Each of our Woogas plays an important role in our success as a company and in shaping our culture.

You will lead analytics projects involving multiple team members to understand, segment, predict and influence the behaviour of our players across our games portfolio
You will build data tools for our product managers, empowering them to deliver actionable insights and recommendations for our game teams
You will use experiments, advanced analytics and ML to find levers for product optimization
You will proactively drive improvements of and provide education on our analytics tools

The ML Platform & Developer Productivity department consists of five teams supporting almost 2000 Software Engineers and Applied Scientists all over Zalando across the whole Software Development and ML Ops livecycle. By offering the best tools and processes well integrated into our central “Sunrise” platform backed by backstage.io open source software, the team has a high impact on how fast and safe delivery teams in Zalando can experiment, build, test, and ship to production.

Our vision is that Engineers and Applied Scientists have all the tools they need at their fingertips. They can easily access documentation, pre-built services, and templates to build new solutions quickly. The technical setup is largely standardised, making it easy to upgrade without distractions. Teams start with default templates and can customise if needed. Changes can be rolled out to production in minutes, multiple times a day, and we separate deployments from rollouts, allowing us to enable or disable features centrally. This fast pace of experimentation and testing helps prevent incidents. If something goes wrong, we detect the issue automatically and safely roll back changes so experts can investigate without stress.

Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is a global management consulting firm and the world’s leading advisor on business strategy. We partner with clients from the private, public, and not-for-profit sectors in all regions to identify their highest-value opportunities, address their most critical challenges, and transform their enterprises. Our customized approach combines deep insight into the dynamics of companies and markets with close collaboration at all levels of the client organization. This ensures that our clients achieve sustainable competitive advantage, build more capable organizations, and secure lasting results. Founded in 1963, BCG is a private company with offices in more than 90 cities in 50 countries. For more information, please visit bcg.com.

BCG’s clients are the world’s top business leaders. From computers to retailing, our professional expertise spans over 50 industries. The vast majority of our clients rank among the 500 largest companies in each of our three major regions–Americas (North and South), Europe Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Additionally, we work with a number of small- to medium-sized companies, both public and private.

The success of our assignments routinely leads our clients to maintain long-term relationships with us. Over 85 percent of our revenues come from clients who continue to work with us from one year to the next to maintain the momentum for change and to continually improve bottom-line results they have achieved with our help.

We pride ourselves on our fresh thinking. Our evolving ideas profoundly change the way most businesses think about competition. Many leading business concepts over the past three decades originated with BCG–including, experience curve, time-based competition, Segment-of-One® marketing, deconstruction, and trading up. Our recent Collateral Damage publication series has addressed the implications for managers of the on-going financial crisis.

We believe that no other consulting organization has concentrated as thoroughly on understanding business competition and helping companies make the changes necessary to succeed in increasingly competitive markets.

La réputation mondiale du cabinet de conseil en gestion Boston Consulting Group (BCG), comme l'un des meilleurs en gestion, découle de plus de cinquante années d'expérience à aider les cadres supérieurs à découvrir et réaliser tout le potentiel de leur entreprise. Notre mission consiste à appuyer nos clients à réaliser des avantages concurrentiels durables en offrant des solutions personnalisées. Nous croyons fermement qu'il faut travailler avec nos clients, pas à leurs dépens. Nous collaborons avec chaque client pour l'aider à prendre une direction et à faire face aux défis organisationnels et opérationnels.

Fondé en 1963, BCG compte maintenant plus de 11,000 experts-conseils, et ce, dans plus de 90 bureaux dans le monde entier. Les clients du BCG sont les dirigeants des plus importantes entreprises du monde. Des ordinateurs jusqu'à la vente au détail, notre expertise professionnelle s'étend à plus de 50 industries. La grande majorité de nos clients figurent parmi les 500 plus grandes entreprises dans chacune de nos trois régions principales – Les Amériques (nord et sud), l'Europe (incluant le Moyen-Orient et l'Afrique) et l'Asie-Pacifique. De plus, nous travaillons avec un certain nombre de petites et moyennes entreprises, tant publiques que privées.

Notre succès, provenant des mandats qui nous sont assignés, nous permet d'établir des relations à long terme avec nos clients. Plus de 85 pourcents de nos revenus proviennent de clients qui continuent à travailler avec nous d'une année à l'autre pour conserver l'élan de changement et pour améliorer continuellement les résultats nets qu'ils ont réalisés grâce à notre aide.

Nous sommes fiers de notre approche innovatrice. Nos idées évolutives changent profondément la manière dont la plupart des entreprises considèrent la concurrence. Plusieurs des principaux concepts d'affaires, au cours des trois dernières décennies, ont commencé avec BCG, y compris la courbe d'apprentissage, la concurrence calculée sur le temps, le marketing Segment-of-One®, le démantèlement et l'extension ascendante. Nos récentes publications de la série Collateral Damage ont traité de l'implication des dirigeants face à la crise financière en cours.

Nous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.

Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is a global management consulting firm and the world’s leading advisor on business strategy. We partner with clients from the private, public, and not-for-profit sectors in all regions to identify their highest-value opportunities, address their most critical challenges, and transform their enterprises. Our customized approach combines deep insight into the dynamics of companies and markets with close collaboration at all levels of the client organization. This ensures that our clients achieve sustainable competitive advantage, build more capable organizations, and secure lasting results. Founded in 1963, BCG is a private company with offices in more than 90 cities in 50 countries. For more information, please visit bcg.com.

BCG’s clients are the world’s top business leaders. From computers to retailing, our professional expertise spans over 50 industries. The vast majority of our clients rank among the 500 largest companies in each of our three major regions–Americas (North and South), Europe Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Additionally, we work with a number of small- to medium-sized companies, both public and private.

The success of our assignments routinely leads our clients to maintain long-term relationships with us. Over 85 percent of our revenues come from clients who continue to work with us from one year to the next to maintain the momentum for change and to continually improve bottom-line results they have achieved with our help.

We pride ourselves on our fresh thinking. Our evolving ideas profoundly change the way most businesses think about competition. Many leading business concepts over the past three decades originated with BCG–including, experience curve, time-based competition, Segment-of-One® marketing, deconstruction, and trading up. Our recent Collateral Damage publication series has addressed the implications for managers of the on-going financial crisis.

We believe that no other consulting organization has concentrated as thoroughly on understanding business competition and helping companies make the changes necessary to succeed in increasingly competitive markets.

La réputation mondiale du cabinet de conseil en gestion Boston Consulting Group (BCG), comme l'un des meilleurs en gestion, découle de plus de cinquante années d'expérience à aider les cadres supérieurs à découvrir et réaliser tout le potentiel de leur entreprise.

Plusieurs des principaux concepts d'affaires, au cours des trois dernières décennies, ont commencé avec BCG, y compris la courbe d'apprentissage, la concurrence calculée sur le temps, le marketing Segment-of-One®, le démantèlement et l'extension ascendante. Nos récentes publications de la série Collateral Damage ont traité de l'implication des dirigeants face à la crise financière en cours.

Nous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.

Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is a global management consulting firm and the world’s leading advisor on business strategy. We partner with clients from the private, public, and not-for-profit sectors in all regions to identify their highest-value opportunities, address their most critical challenges, and transform their enterprises. Our customized approach combines deep insight into the dynamics of companies and markets with close collaboration at all levels of the client organization. This ensures that our clients achieve sustainable competitive advantage, build more capable organizations, and secure lasting results. Founded in 1963, BCG is a private company with offices in more than 90 cities in 50 countries. For more information, please visit bcg.com.

BCG’s clients are the world’s top business leaders. From computers to retailing, our professional expertise spans over 50 industries. The vast majority of our clients rank among the 500 largest companies in each of our three major regions–Americas (North and South), Europe Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Additionally, we work with a number of small- to medium-sized companies, both public and private.

The success of our assignments routinely leads our clients to maintain long-term relationships with us. Over 85 percent of our revenues come from clients who continue to work with us from one year to the next to maintain the momentum for change and to continually improve bottom-line results they have achieved with our help.

We pride ourselves on our fresh thinking. Our evolving ideas profoundly change the way most businesses think about competition. Many leading business concepts over the past three decades originated with BCG–including, experience curve, time-based competition, Segment-of-One® marketing, deconstruction, and trading up. Our recent Collateral Damage publication series has addressed the implications for managers of the on-going financial crisis.

We believe that no other consulting organization has concentrated as thoroughly on understanding business competition and helping companies make the changes necessary to succeed in increasingly competitive markets.

La réputation mondiale du cabinet de conseil en gestion Boston Consulting Group (BCG), comme l'un des meilleurs en gestion, découle de plus de cinquante années d'expérience à aider les cadres supérieurs à découvrir et réaliser tout le potentiel de leur entreprise. Notre mission consiste à appuyer nos clients à réaliser des avantages concurrentiels durables en offrant des solutions personnalisées. Nous croyons fermement qu'il faut travailler avec nos clients, pas à leurs dépens. Nous collaborons avec chaque client pour l'aider à prendre une direction et à faire face aux défis organisationnels et opérationnels.

Fondé en 1963, BCG compte maintenant plus de 11,000 experts-conseils, et ce, dans plus de 90 bureaux dans le monde entier. Les clients du BCG sont les dirigeants des plus importantes entreprises du monde. Des ordinateurs jusqu'à la vente au détail, notre expertise professionnelle s'étend à plus de 50 industries. La grande majorité de nos clients figurent parmi les 500 plus grandes entreprises dans chacune de nos trois régions principales – Les Amériques (nord et sud), l'Europe (incluant le Moyen-Orient et l'Afrique) et l'Asie-Pacifique. De plus, nous travaillons avec un certain nombre de petites et moyennes entreprises, tant publiques que privées.

Notre succès, provenant des mandats qui nous sont assignés, nous permet d'établir des relations à long terme avec nos clients. Plus de 85 pourcents de nos revenus proviennent de clients qui continuent à travailler avec nous d'une année à l'autre pour conserver l'élan de changement et pour améliorer continuellement les résultats nets qu'ils ont réalisés grâce à notre aide.

Nous sommes fiers de notre approche innovatrice. Nos idées évolutives changent profondément la manière dont la plupart des entreprises considèrent la concurrence. Plusieurs des principaux concepts d'affaires, au cours des trois dernières décennies, ont commencé avec BCG, y compris la courbe d'apprentissage, la concurrence calculée sur le temps, le marketing Segment-of-One®, le démantèlement et l'extension ascendante. Nos récentes publications de la série Collateral Damage ont traité de l'implication des dirigeants face à la crise financière en cours.

Nous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.

The ideal candidate can apply strong business acumen to propose product changes, develop end-to-end technical solutions, and is comfortable working with a highly cross functional team. In this role, you will help us tackle problems at airports such as:


How do we efficiently match drivers and riders at the airport to reduce wait times?
Are we able to forecast ride demand and implement driver guidance to ensure riders can rely on Lyft for an airport ride at all times of the day?
How can we develop a technical model to predict ride wait times and communicate this to drivers?

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Nos récentes publications de la série Collateral Damage ont traité de l'implication des dirigeants face à la crise financière en cours.

Nous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.

Our recent Collateral Damage publication series has addressed the implications for managers of the on-going financial crisis.<br><br>We believe that no other consulting organization has concentrated as thoroughly on understanding business competition and helping companies make the changes necessary to succeed in increasingly competitive markets.<br><br>La réputation mondiale du cabinet de conseil en gestion Boston Consulting Group (BCG), comme l'un des meilleurs en gestion, découle de plus de cinquante années d'expérience à aider les cadres supérieurs à découvrir et réaliser tout le potentiel de leur entreprise.

Including your own.

The Impact You’ll Make

With treatments for hundreds of diseases in our sights, we’ve built a data science team with domain expertise in computer science, bioinformatics, physics, biology, mathematics, applied statistics, and more. We work side-by-side with biologists, oncologists, chemists, software engineers, and many others; together, we develop the tools and methods to turn our experimental data into treatments for pathologies that affect the lives of countless individuals. As a data scientist supporting the development of our industrialized workflows, you’ll work with a highly dynamic team that is focused on improving how we move from ideation through to advanced candidate drugs in a way that accelerates decision-making and automates as much as possible to scale the impact that we can have.

You’ll have access to unbelievable scales of data: we currently run up to 2.2 million experiments each week, our ground-breaking Phenom-1 foundation model , trained on > 1 billion in-house images, and our maps of biology and chemistry that contain > 5 trillion relationships across multiple biological and chemical contexts.

In this role, you will leverage this data as you:


Develop methods, metrics, benchmarks, and models to help drive drug discovery in a standardized way.
Convert exploratory analysis into production-quality functions that can be incorporated into in-house Python packages and that support at-scale generation of data packages to accelerate decisions on passing programs through internal stage gates.
Create and analyze enormous sets of connected data for a variety of programs to learn how best to advance drug discovery in an industrialized way
Collaborate with engineering teams to mature your models and analyses and put them into productionized flows
Deliver quickly and iteratively, both supporting in-flight programs and building improvements for the long-term in short-lived, agile workstreams
Learn to leverage new code packages and data science techniques as needed


Location:

Making Toronto, Canada your home base is ideal, however, we will consider on-site work in our Salt Lake City office as well.

The Team You’ll Join

We are an application-oriented group whose goal is to discover drugs at scale, using the toolkit of computational science in collaboration with our counterparts in other engineering (software and data engineering, laboratory automation), scientific (biology, chemistry, clinical science), and operational (laboratory operations, regulatory affairs) disciplines. We are value-driving - data science at Recursion is not just an accelerating function; it is a core part of our value proposition. As data scientists, we are responsible for showing up as leaders and visionaries, helping to shape how Recursion delivers on our mission. We work on what matters and deliver in timescales of weeks not quarters. We focus on the impact that we are trying to make and the “why” of what we are trying to deliver and are resilient if the “how” of what we are doing needs to change.

The Experience You’ll Need


1+ years practical experience applying probability, statistics, and machine learning to real-world datasets in service of academic or business applications and recommendations.
Strong preference for experience in the field of biosciences (particularly pharmaceuticals) or working on projects that require regular cross-disciplinary collaboration.
Experience working within a fast-paced interdisciplinary team to solve business-relevant problems and communicating complex concepts and methods to audiences with diverse technical backgrounds.
High fluency with the Python data stack (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc).
Experience in collaborative data product development and peer code review, including version control tools like git.
Experience developing, releasing, and maintaining data products in a continuous-use production environment.
Nice to have: experience in creating compelling visualizations of high-dimensional data that enable clear decision-making and interpretation, prompt engineering for LLMs, cheminformatics, OR analysis of RNA sequencing data.

How You’ll Be Supported


You will be assigned a peer trail guide to support you as you onboard and get familiar with Recursion systems
Receive real-time feedback on code quality and best practices from a team of peer experts
Ability to participate and learn from your colleagues in our regular all-hands, journal club & tech talks for Data Science
Option to attend conferences to learn more from colleagues, networks, and more to better your skillset


The Values That We Hope You Share


We Care: We care about our drug candidates, our Recursionauts, their families, each other, our communities, the patients we aim to serve and their loved ones. We also care about our work.
We Learn: Learning from the diverse perspectives of our fellow Recursionauts, and from failure, is an essential part of how we make progress.
We Deliver: We are unapologetic that our expectations for delivery are extraordinarily high. There is urgency to our existence: we sprint at maximum engagement, making time and space to recover.
Act Boldly with Integrity: No company changes the world or reinvents an industry without being bold. It must be balanced; not by timidity, but by doing the right thing even when no one is looking.
We are One Recursion: We operate with a 'company first, team second' mentality. Our success comes from working as one interdisciplinary team.


Recursion spends time and energy connecting every aspect of work to these values. They aren’t static, but regularly discussed and questioned because we make decisions rooted in those values in our day-to-day work. You can read more about our values and how we live them every day here .

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Machine Learning Infrastructure group at Stripe aims to provide state of the art infrastructure and support for building and operationalizing AI/ML models for all business verticals within the company, including but not limited to models that mitigate risks across Stripe’s products and services globally, and models that help our customers to fight fraud by leveraging Stripe’s user facing products like Radar and Identity. ML is a top priority for Stripe in the coming years. With the phenomenal developments happening in the field of AI, we are positioned to accelerate the adoption of AI/ML across all parts of the company by building highly scalable and reliable foundational infrastructure.

What you’ll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching machine learning models using tools such as XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch.
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly impact Stripe’s top line metrics.
Propose new feature ideas and design data pipelines to incorporate them into our models
Improve the way we evaluate and monitor our model and system performance
Collaborate with stakeholders and drive end-to-end projects involving a variety of technologies and systems to successful completion.



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


At least 5 years of industry experience doing end-to-end ML development on a machine learning team and bringing ML models to production
Advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. computer science, statistics, physics, …)
Proficient in Python, Scala, Spark



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Hands-on applied ML (model training, deployment to production, etc) experience
You keep up-to-date on the latest in AI engineering practices and research
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data
Knowledge about how to manipulate data to perform analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to evaluate a hypothesis.
Experience evaluating niche and upcoming ML solutions



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Including your own.

The Impact You’ll Make

With treatments for hundreds of diseases in our sights, we’ve built a data science team with domain expertise in computer science, bioinformatics, physics, biology, mathematics, applied statistics, and more. We work side-by-side with biologists, oncologists, chemists, software engineers, and many others; together, we develop the tools and methods to turn our experimental data into treatments for pathologies that affect the lives of countless individuals. As a data scientist supporting the development of our industrialized workflows, you’ll work with a highly dynamic team that is focused on improving how we move from ideation through to advanced candidate drugs in a way that accelerates decision-making and automates as much as possible to scale the impact that we can have.

You’ll have access to unbelievable scales of data: we currently run up to 2.2 million experiments each week, our ground-breaking Phenom-1 foundation model , trained on > 1 billion in-house images, and our maps of biology and chemistry that contain > 5 trillion relationships across multiple biological and chemical contexts.

In this role, you will leverage this data as you:


Develop methods, metrics, benchmarks, and models to help drive drug discovery in a standardized way.
Convert exploratory analysis into production-quality functions that can be incorporated into in-house Python packages and that support at-scale generation of data packages to accelerate decisions on passing programs through internal stage gates.
Create and analyze enormous sets of connected data for a variety of programs to learn how best to advance drug discovery in an industrialized way
Collaborate with engineering teams to mature your models and analyses and put them into productionized flows
Deliver quickly and iteratively, both supporting in-flight programs and building improvements for the long-term in short-lived, agile workstreams
Learn to leverage new code packages and data science techniques as needed


Location:

Making Toronto, Canada your home base is ideal, however, we will consider on-site work in our Salt Lake City office as well.

The Team You’ll Join

We are an application-oriented group whose goal is to discover drugs at scale, using the toolkit of computational science in collaboration with our counterparts in other engineering (software and data engineering, laboratory automation), scientific (biology, chemistry, clinical science), and operational (laboratory operations, regulatory affairs) disciplines. We are value-driving - data science at Recursion is not just an accelerating function; it is a core part of our value proposition. As data scientists, we are responsible for showing up as leaders and visionaries, helping to shape how Recursion delivers on our mission. We work on what matters and deliver in timescales of weeks not quarters. We focus on the impact that we are trying to make and the “why” of what we are trying to deliver and are resilient if the “how” of what we are doing needs to change.

The Experience You’ll Need


1+ years practical experience applying probability, statistics, and machine learning to real-world datasets in service of academic or business applications and recommendations.
Strong preference for experience in the field of biosciences (particularly pharmaceuticals) or working on projects that require regular cross-disciplinary collaboration.
Experience working within a fast-paced interdisciplinary team to solve business-relevant problems and communicating complex concepts and methods to audiences with diverse technical backgrounds.
High fluency with the Python data stack (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc).
Experience in collaborative data product development and peer code review, including version control tools like git.
Experience developing, releasing, and maintaining data products in a continuous-use production environment.
Nice to have: experience in creating compelling visualizations of high-dimensional data that enable clear decision-making and interpretation, prompt engineering for LLMs, cheminformatics, OR analysis of RNA sequencing data.

How You’ll Be Supported


You will be assigned a peer trail guide to support you as you onboard and get familiar with Recursion systems
Receive real-time feedback on code quality and best practices from a team of peer experts
Ability to participate and learn from your colleagues in our regular all-hands, journal club & tech talks for Data Science
Option to attend conferences to learn more from colleagues, networks, and more to better your skillset


The Values That We Hope You Share


We Care: We care about our drug candidates, our Recursionauts, their families, each other, our communities, the patients we aim to serve and their loved ones. We also care about our work.
We Learn: Learning from the diverse perspectives of our fellow Recursionauts, and from failure, is an essential part of how we make progress.
We Deliver: We are unapologetic that our expectations for delivery are extraordinarily high. There is urgency to our existence: we sprint at maximum engagement, making time and space to recover.
Act Boldly with Integrity: No company changes the world or reinvents an industry without being bold. It must be balanced; not by timidity, but by doing the right thing even when no one is looking.
We are One Recursion: We operate with a 'company first, team second' mentality. Our success comes from working as one interdisciplinary team.


Recursion spends time and energy connecting every aspect of work to these values. They aren’t static, but regularly discussed and questioned because we make decisions rooted in those values in our day-to-day work. You can read more about our values and how we live them every day here .

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Come take off with us!

The yearly total compensation for this senior position ranges from $150,000 to $350,000 CAD. Compensation will be determined by candidates' relevant qualifications, knowledge, skills and work experience. Total compensation can include a solid base salary and will also include equity (options / RSUs), sign-on bonus and other potential incentives.

We build machine learning services and data pipelines to automatically extract insights about competitors from both public and internal data sources. Every day, our services process millions of data points, including news articles, press releases, webpage changes, Slack posts, emails, reviews, CRM opportunities, and user actions. We utilize a broad array of ML techniques, including classification, clustering, recommendation, summarization, prompt engineering, vector search, and retrieval augmented generation.

Q: Klue who?

A: We’re Klue and from a technical perspective, Klue’s mission is to descale huge amounts of data to the human level, so people can process it and make use of it. Klue is that trusted intermediary, right now it’s proven for sales enablement, but tomorrow it’s all teams enablement.

Q: What level of experience are we looking for?

A: Right now we are looking for senior-level experienced Back-End Engineers with a background in GenAI, LLMs, or NLP-related work.

Q: What is our development team working on?

A: Services for collecting, processing, and generating timely, relevant intel that is accurately linked to competitors, products, industries, and people

As part of our backend team, we are concerned with data storage and retrieval and the infrastructure to enable that. Here’s what our development team is working on and the opportunity for motivated Software Engineers to dig into, alongside us:


Big Data - lots of data
Ingesting hundreds of thousands of news articles, web pages, marketing, and sales data points per day. The challenge is indexing them for a long period of time and making them searchable and ready for different analyses.
Expanding our Rails REST API and offering public APIs to enable integrations.
Architect infrastructure for a scalable, resilient, and robust service. We are migrating from a monolith architecture to K8S-hosted microservices.
Retrieval Augmented Generation for Compete - An end-to-end system that ingests a real-time feed of compete content from various sources such as Slack, reviews, websites, news, interviews, sales calls, and documents, to generate relevant and factually accurate content


Q: What is our current tech stack?

A: Python (Flask), PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, GCP, AWS, Tensorflow, Keras, Docker, Kubernetes.

Transformers, Pytorch, Hugging Face, Spacy, Sklearn, Pinecone, Kubeflow, Vertex AI, BentoML, Temporal, JS, Github, GPT.

We believe in using whatever tools make sense to get the job done and support our game-changing innovation.

Q: Are you HYBRID FRIENDLY 🤩 ?

A: YES! Hybrid. Best of both worlds (remote & in-office)

Our main Canadian hubs are in Vancouver and Toronto, and most of our teams are located in EST and PST.

You and your team will be in office at least 2 days per week.

Q: What skills do you bring?


Expertise in Python
You stay up to date on recent advances with LLMs and are quick to experiment with the latest approaches including RAG
You own initiatives end to end: from prototyping to production
You lead technical design discussions, write and review technical design documents, and provide technical guidance and directions to the larger engineering team
Expertise in relational databases such as PostgreSQL or MySQL
You are proficient in designing, implementing, and deploying RESTful APIs and you have experience with (non)relational and vector databases.
Experience using Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP
You demonstrate good judgment when making architectural decisions and you understand how those decisions fit into the bigger picture
Experience using NoSQL databases such as Elasticsearch or MongoDB is a plus


Q: What motivates our current team right now?


The type of work. Challenging, stimulating and meaningful work. New and relevant tech stack. We know engineers/developers especially want to work on hard technical and innovative problems.
The inspiration from skilled and proven leaders.
Entrepreneurial fingerprints on what will be a future billion dollar company anchored in Canada.
Culture, team, and the work environment.
High degree of autonomy and accountability.
High degrees of transparency and high quality communication.


Q: What are the people at Klue like?


Builders
Intellectually Curious
Ambitious
Objective Oriented
Check us out!


Q: What about total compensation & benefits?


Benefits. We currently have extended health benefits starting on your 1st day.
Time off. Take what you need. We want the team to prioritize wellness and avoid burnout. Vacation usually falls into 3 categories: recharging, life-event, & keeping a work-life balance. Just ensure the required work gets done and clear it with your team in advance. You need to take at least two weeks off every year. The average Klue team member takes 2-4 weeks of PTO per year.


⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️

Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Come take off with us!

The yearly total compensation for this senior position ranges from $150,000 to $350,000 CAD.
