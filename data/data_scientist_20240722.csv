We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Nextdoor is where you connect to the neighborhoods that matter to you so you can belong. Our purpose is to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.

Neighbors around the world turn to Nextdoor daily to receive trusted information, give and get help, get things done, and build real-world connections with those nearby — neighbors, businesses, and public services. Today, neighbors rely on Nextdoor in more than 315,000 neighborhoods across 11 countries.

Meet Your Future Neighbors

Product finance, strategy and operations (“Product FSO”) is committed to driving growth through new user acquisition and increasing engagement amongst our existing user base of Neighbors. Today, we work closely with product and engineering teams to understand the impact and trends across growth and engagement while building and maintaining quarterly and long-range forecasts. Historically, we’ve been strong in our reporting and forecasting; however, are still building the bandwidth and capabilities to dive deeper into our data to better understand “why” we’re seeing what we’re seeing to subsequently get to “what” we should be doing about it.

We are looking for an entrepreneurial and driven Senior Data Scientist to build these Business Intelligence capabilities and establish the foundation of our data and analytics work. You will work closely with various cross-functional teams such as product, engineering, etc. to develop a BI layer and assist us in better understanding key metrics through causal analyses, data tooling, and dashboarding. Successful candidates will exhibit technical acumen, product sense and business savvy. You are passionate about leveraging the power of data to drive product changes with quality and agility. You are a team player.

At Nextdoor, we offer a warm and inclusive work environment that embraces a hybrid employment experience, providing a flexible experience for our valued employees.

The Impact You’ll Make

Role

The work of Product FSO is essential to the growth and success of the company and involves frequent opportunities to showcase key metrics and findings to senior leadership. In this role, you will:

Insight discovery: Deliver data insights and drive for adoption through tools (e.g. dashboards, self-serve reporting), memos and presentations. Additionally, analyze data to identify trends, discrepancies, and opportunities for improvement. Provide actionable recommendations and insights to senior management to facilitate informed decision-making
Analytics and Forecasting: Conduct statistical analyses and modeling, exploratory/causal analysis, and metric development to uncover data insights that in turn better inform key decisions and enable driver-based forecasting of user activity.
Performance management support: Assist in our weekly performance tracking and management of business operations. Ensure accuracy and timeliness in performance reporting, helping the team meet its short and long-term objectives
Analytics foundation: Partner with our Analytics Engineering team to create and maintain a solid data foundation using advanced data analysis tools and techniques. Extract and manipulate large datasets to create meaningful metrics and insights that inform strategic decisions
Collaboration: Facilitate data ownership and accountability by closely partnering with data science, product, and engineering partners to improve data robustness
Participate in in-person Nextdoor events, trainings, off-sites, volunteer days, and other team building exercises
Build in-person relationships with team members and contribute to the KIND culture that Nextdoor values


What You’ll Bring To The Team


6 - 8+ years working in data science, product analytics, or business intelligence, or equivalent (starting level is flexible)
Strategic-minded, impact-driven, and capable of incorporating larger business context into data questions and product development
Experience architecting, debugging, and executing SQL queries
Excellent knowledge of Looker (preferred) or another BI/visualization tool
Comfortable knowledge of Python or R, including common scientific computing packages and data science tools such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn
Comfort with methods, tools, and packages for statistical modeling and machine learning
Experience formulating, running, and sharing complex analyses, including different types of experiments, cohort retention studies, and other exploratory analysis work
Intermediate knowledge of at least one big data technology such as Hive, Presto, or Spark
Excellent written and oral communication, including ability to effectively communicate complexity to a diverse group of stakeholders
Curiosity about how things work, from both a business and technical perspective
A self-starter who thrives under a high level of ambiguity and autonomy


It’s ok if you don’t have all of these requirements; if you think you’d be a good fit for the role, please get in touch with us!

Bonus Points


Past experience in solving problems in Finance or other business-facing areas
Work experience related to social or community-based products
Work experience related to small businesses and marketplaces
Work experience related to advertising and auction systems
Expertise deploying models to production
Expertise in testing and evaluating the impact of network effects
Knowledge of web applications and service-oriented architecture


Rewards

Compensation, benefits, perks, and recognition programs at Nextdoor come together to create one overall rewards package.

The starting salary for this role is expected to range from $175,000 to $210,000 on an annualized basis, or potentially greater in the event that your 'level' of proficiency exceeds the level expected for the role.

We also expect to award a meaningful equity grant for this role. With equal quarterly vesting, your first vest date would be within the first 3 months of your start date.

Overall, total compensation will vary depending on your relevant skills, experience, and qualifications. We have you covered! Nextdoor employees can choose between a variety of great health plans. We cover 100% of your personal monthly premium for health, dental, and vision – and provide a OneMedical membership for concierge care.

Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

A portfolio company is looking to hire machine learning engineers as their sales increase and they confirm product-market fit.

While being good at what you do are table stakes, we believe the following will make you successful in a startup:


Optimistic individuals are persistent, determined, and unwilling to give up in the face of adversity. They keep working towards a goal or objective despite setbacks or failures. Optimism often involves a combination of perseverance, resilience, and determination.
Growth-oriented individuals embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a key to success. They are willing to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. Growth-oriented individuals are curious, see learning as a lifelong process, and embrace feedback. They are willing to try new things, and are not afraid to change direction if something isn’t working.
Effective individuals collaborate well, work consistently and purposefully towards achieving their goals, efficiently manage their time, and are self-motivated. They are able to identify problems, analyze them critically, and develop effective solutions.

We’re working with a tier-one hedge fund as they continue to scale their Data Science capabilities. Despite what was a challenging year for many in the markets this firm came out with double-digit gains and is continuing to scale for 2024. That was possible by hiring the best talent on the market combining that with first in class technology and resources. Compensation is some of the strongest on the street.




Role Summary




You will focus on utilizing quantitative methods to analyze various alternative and economic data sets (transaction, web traffic, clinical trial, now-cast, survey, shipping, satellite, geolocation etc.) to generate signals for investing. You will work closely with the Portfolio Manager on how your analysis could impact their universe and ultimately PnL.




It’s a given this role has technical elements but equally as important is the ability to communicate your analysis and really look to monetize that. As they look to monetize the data, creativity surrounding the data and analysis is very much encouraged. They need someone who enjoys the technical elements but also wants to combine them with the fundamentals of working close to the markets.




As a senior hire you will lead the most impactful projects, you will also play a part in mentoring some of the junior team members.




Who you are:




Our client is looking for an individual who has a demonstrable interest in the markets as well as strong communication and presentation skills. See the requirements below:




STEM academic background
3+ years of professional experience in a Data Science/ Quantitative capacity working with alternative/ unstructured data

21st Century Cures Act Information

Introduction

The Food and Drug Administration is the federal agency responsible for protecting the public health by helping to ensure the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, and medical devices; and by helping to ensure the safety of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. FDA also has responsibility for regulating the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products to protect the public health and to reduce tobacco use by minors. FDA’s programs are national in scope and effect, and the agency’s activities have a direct and significant impact on multi-billion-dollar industries, in addition to protecting the health and safety of American Consumers. The work of the Agency is carried out by a staff of more than 18,000 scientists, physicians, regulatory and other personnel stationed throughout the United States.




The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) is a Center within FDA that regulates biological products for human use under applicable federal laws, including the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. CBER’s mission is to protect and enhance the public health through the regulation of biological and related products including blood, vaccines, allergenics, tissues, and cellular and gene therapies. CBER protects and advances the public health by ensuring that biological products are safe, effective, and available to those who need them. CBER also provides the public with information to promote the safe and appropriate use of biological products.

The mission of the Office of Biostatistics and Pharmacovigilance (OBPV) involves evaluating the safety and efficacy of the spectrum of CBER products throughout their entire lifecycle, from preclinical to post-marketing. OBPV scientific disciplines include experts in epidemiology, statistics, medicine, risk analysis, public health, genomics, and other scientific areas.

The Division of Analytics and Benefit-Risk Assessment (DABRA) improves the efficiency, consistency, and rigor of the methods used by the office to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CBER regulated products and develops and applies new methods and tools for improving observational epidemiological studies, data mining, and comparative effectiveness studies, and other quantitative aspects of the evaluation of the risks, benefits, and use of biologic products. DABRA leads the OBPV’s programs on quantitative benefit-risk assessment, Real-World Evidence (RWE), and analytics and informatics projects, work that supports the office’s review, regulatory and public health missions. DABRA works with OBPV, other CBER offices, and across the centers to conduct Digital Health Technology (DHT)s-related reviews and activities. These activities include but are not limited to, development of DHTs guidance and participating in public and industry meetings on DHTs-related topics and discussions. DABRA also operates the High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE), which consists of a high-performance computing cluster (HPC) with petabyte scale high-availability storage; a sophisticated web-based genomics analysis platform; support for machine learning in Python and R; and a team of expert bioinformaticians, computer scientists, and software developers.




The Analytics and Real-World Evidence (RWE) Branch (ARWEB) within OBPV leads the office’s programs on Real-World Evidence, analytics, and informatics projects, supporting the office’s review, regulatory, and public health missions. ARWEB develops capability and policy for the use of real-world evidence in regulatory decisions. The HIVE, located within ARWEB, performs complex data analysis on next-gen sequencing experiments, adds custom analytics and pipelines to the HIVE platform, trains, and support users, and assists with big data transfer and storage. It is a cloud-based environment optimized for the storage and analysis of extra-large data, like Next Generation Sequence (NGS) data, Mass Spectroscopy files, Confocal Microscopy images and others.

Duties/Responsibilities

The incumbent serves as a Data Scientist in the High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE) for the Analytics and Real-World Evidence (RWE) Branch (ARWEB) within the Division of Analytics and Benefit-Risk Assessment (DABRA) under the Office of Biostatistics and Pharmacovigilance (OBPV). This position reports to the Branch Chief of ARWEB. The HIVE Data Scientist serves in multiple capacities as the OBPV lead on regulatory applications of next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis technologies, as senior subject matter expert in bio-medical informatics project review and grant applications; and as computational biology and bioinformatics services coordinator and project lead for NGS technology support services regarding research, scientific resources, and administrative activities. The HIVE Data Scientist collaborates with FDA researchers and reviewers by using a combination of biology and bioinformatics expertise to plan and assist in executing bioinformatics and statistical analysis on research projects and regulatory reviews containing next generation sequencing (NGS), genomics, cellular biology, neuroscience, pharmacology, computational biology, and/or structural biology data.

Als Junior Data Scientist (w/d/m) bei Temedica bieten wir Dir komplexe und vielfältige Datensätze in die Du eintauchen und Deine Skills weiterentwickeln kannst. Dein cross-funktionales Team bestehend aus Data-Analysts, -Scientists und -Engineers, steht dabei Deiner persönlichen Entwicklung zur Seite. Gleichzeitig hilfst Du uns unsere Datenprodukte weiterzuentwickeln um wertvolle Erkenntnisse für den Healthcare-Sektor zu gewinnen. Dein dadurch wachsendes Fachwissen hilft so, unsere Erkenntnisse in relevante Empfehlungen für unsere Kund*innen zu verwandeln und so Fortschritte in der Patient*innenversorgung zu erzielen. Klingt nach einer sinnvollen Mission? Worauf wartest Du dann noch: bewirb Dich jetzt und revolutioniere mit uns die individualisierte Gesundheitsversorgung!

Deine Aufgaben


Du verantwortest die frühen Phasen der Datenexploration mit und implementierst aktuelle Datenanalysemethoden (ML und LLM), um verschiedene Datenquellen (z. B. soziale Medien, Verschreibungen, Sales, Apotheken) mit Hilfe modernster (GCP, BigQuery, Python, dbt, Git) Tools zu analysieren.
Du arbeitest mit einem cross-funktionalen Produktteam zusammen, um neue Möglichkeiten zu entdecken, den Wert unserer Daten zu verbessern und neue Datenquellen und deren Integration in Temedicas aktuelles Produktangebot zu analysieren.
Du entwickelst informative und ansprechende Visualisierungen, um wichtige Ergebnisse zu präsentieren und zusätzliche Erkenntnisse zu den Daten zu sammeln.
Du arbeitest eng mit dem Data-Engineering-Team bei Anforderungsanalysen und Implementierung und kannst erste Schritte im Engineering Bereich selbst umsetzen.


Was Du mitbringen solltest


Du hast einen Abschluss (PhD oder M.Sc.) in einem quantitativen Bereich wie Statistik, Mathematik, Informatik, Neurowissenschaften oder ähnlichem; und hast Erfahrung mit der Exploration von Datenquellen und der Beantwortung komplexer Fragen mit modellbasierten statistischen Analysen und Methoden des Machine Learnings.
Du hast während deines Studiums oder beruflich schon an Projekten im Bereich Biologie, Pharma oder Medizin mitgearbeitet.
Du beherrschst Python (Pandas, NumPy, Sci-kit learn), und bist idealerweise mit Technologien wie SQL, dbt, Git oder Looker vertraut.
Du beherrschst Englisch und Deutsch (C1-Niveau) verhandlungssicher.


Was wir dir bieten

Bei Temedica betreten wir Neuland im Bereich der digitalen Gesundheit und stellen das traditionelle Gesundheitsmodell nicht nur in Frage, sondern auf den Kopf. Warum? Wir glauben, dass eine individuelle Behandlung das Grundrecht jedes Patienten und jeder Patientin ist - also machen wir es möglich!

Für uns sind Daten nicht gleich Daten. Unsere Gleichung lautet: Datum + anderes Datum = Insight. Wir entwickeln medizinische Anwendungen, unsere Apps, und nutzen künstliche Intelligenz, um das Verhalten von PatientInnen in sinnvolle Interventionen zu übersetzen. Außerdem kombinieren wir die Daten unserer Apps mit verschiedenen Datenquellen aus der Forschung, dem Social Listening und denen anderer Stakeholder innerhalb unseres Gesundheits-Ökosystems. Basierend auf einem B2B-SaaS-Geschäftsmodell bieten wir unsere Insights in Form neuartiger Datenmonitore an, die vor allem der Pharma-, Biotech- und Lifescience-Branche bisher unbekannte und zudem bahnbrechende Erkenntnisse liefern, durch welche in letzter Folge dann auch personalisierte Medizin möglich wird. Endlich!

Benefits

Aber damit nicht genug! Bei Temedica bieten wir unseren MitarbeiterInnen eine Vielzahl an Benefits. Wir sprechen hier von echten Benefits, nicht etwa von Equipment, Obst oder kostenfreien Getränken. Natürlich sorgen wir dafür, dass Du mit modernsten Geräten arbeitest und Deine tägliche Koffein- und Vitaminversorgung nicht zu kurz kommt - wir bieten aber noch viel mehr. Zum Beispiel:


150 € monatlicher Zuschuss für genau das, was am besten zu Dir und Deinem lifestyle passt: Nach Ablauf der Probezeit kannst Du aus einer langen Liste an Leistungen auswählen, z.B. covern wir für Dein Internet zu Hause, bieten BahnCard- oder ÖPNV-Support, unterstützen Dich mit Kindergartenzuschuss, zusätzlichen Urlaubstagen oder ermöglichen Dir Deine Traum-Workation - die Wahl liegt bei Dir. Natürlich denken wir mit unserer betrieblichen Altersvorsorge (bAV) auch langfristig. Durch einen Zuschuss von 50 % bis zur Obergrenze von 90 € bieten wir Dir hier eine zusätzliche Einkommensoption für später und eine echte Win-Win-Situation. Du sorgst vor und maximierst gleichzeitig Deine Benefits. Schnür' Dir also Dein ganz eigenes, passendes Paket aus allen vorhandenen Optionen!
Hybrid-Work: Das bedeutet für uns remote work von überall innerhalb Deutschlands - außer an 4 Tagen im Monat. Im Team entscheidet Ihr, wann ihr in unserem Münchner Office zusammenkommt, um gemeinsam Erfolge zu feiern oder an diesen kollaborativ zu arbeiten.
Firmen-Offsites und Kick-Offs: Wir nutzen diese Tage, um Wissen auszutauschen und ein besseres Verständnis dafür zu entwickeln, wie wir unsere Ziele erfolgreich erreichen können - gemeinsam. Außerdem fallen im Nachhinein solcher Events oft Worte wie “legendär” oder “großartig”. Lass Dir sagen: Auch das Essen ist es wert!


Gerne erzählen wir Dir in einem ersten Gespräch noch mehr über Benefits und Arbeitsweisen bei Temedica!

Du bist am Zug!

Auf der Suche nach einer spannenden Herausforderung im Bereich der digitalen Gesundheit? Dann komm doch zu uns - wir freuen uns auf Deine Bewerbung!

Wil jij ons helpen om big data een rol in het politiewerk te laten spelen?

Wat ga je doen?

De digitalisering van de maatschappij heeft grote maatschappelijke effecten en biedt kansen voor het aanpakken van maatschappelijke vraagstukken. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is één van de technologieën die in hoog tempo wordt ontwikkeld en toegepast. Voor de politie biedt AI kansen om haar taak effectief uit te blijven voeren en om efficiënter te werken. De politie heeft AI dan ook aangemerkt als een van de sleuteltechnologieën die van belang is voor innovatie en de ontwikkeling van de organisatie.

Als junior data scientist bij Team Wetenschappelijke Ontwikkelingen (TWO) ga je de politieoperatie ondersteunen met behulp van AI. Dit doe je (onder andere) door wetenschappelijk onderzoek, dat wordt gedaan door promovendi bij het AI-lab, toe te passen op de politieoperatie. Daarnaast toon je initiatief om aan projecten, die vanuit de operatie komen, mee te werken en hierin de juiste data science of AI-oplossing toe te passen. Je gaat werken met verschillende soorten data zoals beeld en tekst. Hierin ben je op zoek naar nieuwe mogelijkheden en technieken om zo goed mogelijke resultaten te bereiken.

Het data wetenschappelijk werk is nog volop in ontwikkeling bij de politie. Daarom is het mogelijk dat er ook aanpalende werkzaamheden moeten worden verricht zoals data preparatie of business analyse.

Waar ga je werken?

Het Nationaal Politielab AI (NPAI) bestaat uit verschillende onderdelen. Een deel wat zich focust op wetenschappelijk onderzoek waar promovendi werkzaam zijn en het Team Wetenschappelijke Ontwikkelingen (TWO).

Wetenschappelijk onderzoek is de samenwerking van de politie met verschillende universiteiten (Universiteit Utrecht, de Universiteit van Amsterdam, en de TU Delft). Het doel van dit deel van het Politielab AI, is om samen met de wetenschap kennis op te bouwen en verantwoorde toepassingen te realiseren voor de politie met state-of-the-art AI. Hiertoe werken meerdere master studenten, promovendi (oftewel PhD-kandidaten), onderzoekers, postdocs en senior wetenschappers (waaronder hoogleraren) samen. Het wetenschappelijk onderzoek binnen het Politielab AI heeft een centrale rol in de ontwikkeling van AI binnen de politie. Op dit moment werken negentien promovendi in de wetenschappelijke tak van het Politielab.

Jij gaat werken bij Team Wetenschappelijke Ontwikkelingen. De primaire taak is de overdracht faciliteren van onderzoeken van promovendi naar inzet binnen de politie. Er werken momenteel elf medewerkers bij TWO.

Het TWO heeft een aantal taken


het vertalen van onderzoeksresultaten naar de operatie. Hiermee vormt TWO de brug tussen het wetenschappelijk onderzoek en de inzet binnen de politie.
het opbouwen (op basis van de onderzoeksagenda) van kennis en het maken van “verantwoorde” toepassingen (concepten) waar anderen middels experimenten op doorontwikkelen zoals de Dienst ICT en het programma Digitalisering.
het, waar nodig, begeleiden van experimenten en proeftuinen die onder leiding van het programma Digitalisering plaatsvinden.


Wie ben jij?

Als junior data scientist combineer jij je kennis van data en verschillende technieken met je enthousiasme om dit toe te passen binnen de politie. Je bent leergierig en vindt het belangrijk om bij te blijven in je vakgebied. Ook ben je proactief en waar je kansen ziet spreek je dit uit. Je weet dit te vertalen naar mogelijke nieuwe projecten om je collega’s te ondersteunen. Daarnaast vind je het belangrijk om in verbinding te staan met zowel de operationele collega’s als met mede data scientists. Met beide collega’s kun je goed communiceren en samenwerken. Hierdoor krijg je een goed beeld van de zaken die spelen en voor welke problemen bestaande oplossingen kunnen worden toegepast.

Daarnaast beschik je over


hbo werk- en denkniveau* bij voorkeur in een technische specialisatie zoals Artifical Intelligence, Data Science, Business Analytics, Computer Science of vergelijkbaar;
kennis met het toepassen van verschillende data science en AI toepassingen;
kennis en ervaring met Python;
werkervaring bij een (grote) overheidsinstelling, bij voorkeur in het veiligheidsdomein;
werkervaring in het opzetten van AI projecten en verandervraagstukken.
het is een pre als je beschikt over ervaring met Git, Kubernetes, CI/CD (devops), graph databases en Test Driven Development (TDD).


Wat wij bieden

De standplaats is Nieuwegein. Er is ruimte voor 1 fte. Het betreft een functie voor 36 uur per week. Omdat goede mensen belangrijk zijn binnen de politie investeren we in jouw toekomst. We bieden uitgebreide ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden en een aanstelling in tijdelijke dienst voor een proeftijd van een jaar. Bij voldoende functioneren wordt de aanstelling na een jaar omgezet in een vaste aanstelling.

Verder kun je het volgende van ons verwachten

What you will do & what we offer

The mission of Scibids is to provide media buyers with fully automated buying strategies for display campaigns, leading to uncompared performances for a minimum of human work.

As a DataScientist, your role will be to evaluate and improve ""Scibids DoubleVerify"" bidding algorithms, which are Scibids main asset, and to actively participate into Scibids automation and development process: each business case not yet automatically handled by our product should be met by the corresponding product improvement. This position will combine analytical rigor, a relentless curiosity, a strong knowledge of statistical methods and experience in implementing them.

This position will combine high development standards, a relentless curiosity, a strong understanding of business priorities and the ambition for your work to become a real game changer!

On a day to day basis, your responsibilities will include:


working with massive datasets (billions of ads impressions/month) and millions of variables.
solving non-routine analysis problems (not handled by off-the-shelf ML solvers).


solving challenging scaling/engineering problems as our system produces thousands of ML models per day.


working closely with the commercial and customer success team and help identify the business cases where a new algorithm is needed/existing ones need improvement.
identify and automate any repetitive process taking place at Scibids, including cases where this means developing some AI routines replacing “human common sense”.


Qualifications

Minimum qualifications:


MS degree in applied mathematics (e.g., statistics, probabilities, operations research, machine learning).
Work / academic projects experience in data analysis or related field (e.g., as a statistician/data scientist) with actual algorithms implementation in an industry programming language (eg Python, C++...)


Preferred Qualifications


Professional/academic experience in a SQL-like language.


Technical stack relevant to the position


Python
SQL
Kubernetes, Docker, Github
Google Cloud Environment, App Engine Standard, Cloud SQL, Google Cloud Datastore...


Cultural fit


Do things only once. No repetitive task survives ingenuity and automation: at Scibids, everything needs to scale!
Base your decisions on data points. Preconceived personal convictions rarely survive thorough confrontation with actual data.
Work in a team and be curious. Every Scibids member has stock-options and is focused on the same objective: make Scibids the next adtech unicorn! This means being interested in how one’s daily personal work fits in Scibids general strategy and having in mind the greater good of the company rather than individual accomplishments.
Have a good laugh. We are a young, hard-working team with huge ambitions: nothing wipes off long hours of work better than sharing a drink with the team!


Others


Contract type: full-time position (French “CDI”).
Based in Paris (75008) – Champs-Elysées

Do you like to create insights and turn them into action to create lasting impact? We are searching for an experienced Data Scientist for our Data & AI team to support our clients by combining business sense with data modelling. If this description fits your profile, we are looking for you!

The Data & AI team at IG&H is using the latest data and AI technology to help our clients innovate. To do so, our team of 25 data experts works closely together with our Technology and Sector teams. Through smart collaboration, we have delivered over 40 (Gen)AI projects in the last two years for our clients in Retail, Healthcare and Financial Services. As a Data Scientist, you will play a central role in truly understanding our client’s needs, translating this into value, creating solutions, developing Gen(AI) models and turning them into action. We believe it is key to have business sense as well as broad experience with data related topics (analytics, artificial intelligence, etc.) to create real business value. On top of that, you need to be able to communicate clearly and convincingly. Not only for effective project execution, but also to inspire (internal) stakeholders on the latest trends and developments in the field of Data and AI.

You will typically work in multidisciplinary project teams for one project at a time. Although being able to deliver work independently is appreciated, involvement of a project manager and technical experts ensures high-quality delivery and facilitates you to maintain a steep learning curve. We believe in diverse teams and diverse profiles in our Data & AI team. Some of our Data Scientists develop to be great consultants with technical knowledge and execution power, while others focus more on gaining deep technical expertise to deliver value from there. Working on a different range of projects in different sectors, you’ll be able to find your own sweet spot.

In addition, we believe that a caring and fun working environment will help you to dare to step out of your comfort zone and learn. We offer continuous learning through the IG&H Academy, in which you will get trainings to boost your data science, consulting and people skills. Also, you will be assigned a mentor, who will be there for you to provide you with guidance.

Above all, people are at the heart of what we do. This of course comes back in the work we deliver for our clients (why make a data product if the people who need to use it do not understand or want to use it?). At the same time, a fun working culture is key for who we are. With an inspiring office in Utrecht where we can connect, have abundant parties, team activities and sport events (both organized for the entire IG&H organization as well as specifically for the Data & Analytics team), IG&H is truly a Great Place To Work. And yes, we are certified!

Working for the Data & AI Team at IG&H Consulting is incredibly diverse, and fun at the same time. It’s been a great place to develop my technical know-how, management consulting skills and commercial effectivity. The team is young and ambitious, with a strong desire to solve complex puzzles, develop personally & professionally and do fun activities together. All in all, IG&H has been a great place to work for over 6 years already!

What you will do & what we offer

The mission of Scibids is to provide media buyers with fully automated buying strategies for display campaigns, leading to uncompared performances for a minimum of human work.

As a DataScientist, your role will be to evaluate and improve ""Scibids DoubleVerify"" bidding algorithms, which are Scibids main asset, and to actively participate into Scibids automation and development process: each business case not yet automatically handled by our product should be met by the corresponding product improvement. This position will combine analytical rigor, a relentless curiosity, a strong knowledge of statistical methods and experience in implementing them.

This position will combine high development standards, a relentless curiosity, a strong understanding of business priorities and the ambition for your work to become a real game changer!

On a day to day basis, your responsibilities will include:


working with massive datasets (billions of ads impressions/month) and millions of variables.
solving non-routine analysis problems (not handled by off-the-shelf ML solvers).


solving challenging scaling/engineering problems as our system produces thousands of ML models per day.


working closely with the commercial and customer success team and help identify the business cases where a new algorithm is needed/existing ones need improvement.
identify and automate any repetitive process taking place at Scibids, including cases where this means developing some AI routines replacing “human common sense”.


Qualifications

Minimum qualifications:


MS degree in applied mathematics (e.g., statistics, probabilities, operations research, machine learning).
Work / academic projects experience in data analysis or related field (e.g., as a statistician/data scientist) with actual algorithms implementation in an industry programming language (eg Python, C++...)


Preferred Qualifications


Professional/academic experience in a SQL-like language.


Technical stack relevant to the position


Python
SQL
Kubernetes, Docker, Github
Google Cloud Environment, App Engine Standard, Cloud SQL, Google Cloud Datastore...


Cultural fit


Do things only once. No repetitive task survives ingenuity and automation: at Scibids, everything needs to scale!
Base your decisions on data points. Preconceived personal convictions rarely survive thorough confrontation with actual data.
Work in a team and be curious. Every Scibids member has stock-options and is focused on the same objective: make Scibids the next adtech unicorn! This means being interested in how one’s daily personal work fits in Scibids general strategy and having in mind the greater good of the company rather than individual accomplishments.
Have a good laugh. We are a young, hard-working team with huge ambitions: nothing wipes off long hours of work better than sharing a drink with the team!


Others


Contract type: full-time position (French “CDI”).
Based in Paris (75008) – Champs-Elysées
Preferred availability: ASAP
Compensation: competitive package including fix salary.
Exact figures depend on profile.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Ready to ? Who you are:


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.


Data Science is an integral component of Coinbase’s product and decision making process: we work in partnership with Product, Engineering and Design to influence the roadmap and better understand our users.

What You'll Be Doing

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.<br><br>So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.<br><br>Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us.

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

          <strong>Company Description<br><br></strong>Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.<br><br>So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.<br><br>Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us.
