About the New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt, the best place to order groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, and other retail goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!) 🚀

About The New Verticals Analytics Team

Our New Verticals Analytics team sits at the intersection of product development, strategic planning, and operational execution. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design, and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions, to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience that combines scientific expertise with stakeholder engagement. When you join this team, you will be taking ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from the ground up, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we want you on our team.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
4+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis using statistical software packages in Python or R.
Expertise in causal inference (Diff in Diff, Synthetic control).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Define ambitious goals for our AI products and identify key areas for improvement.
Lead the development and implementation of RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) pipelines.
Define, benchmark, and continually refine performance metrics with both short-term and long-term plans.


We're seeking someone with expertise in LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation, fine-tuning, and prompting techniques. Your contributions will be essential in propelling our AI advancements and securing our market position.

Qualifications


5+ years of experience as an AI/ML engineer or comparable academic background
Proven track record in building complex RAG pipelines
Skilled in evaluating and benchmarking LLMs
Proficient in fine-tuning and reinforcement learning
Strong knowledge of prompting techniques
Fluent English


Bonus


Published papers on relevant generative AI topics
Experience with search-related features
Prior experience in a startup environment


Benefits


Competitive salary and equity package
Beautiful office in Berlin with home office days
Opportunity to join a small, agile team with a big mission
Significant growth and learning opportunities from day one
Be part of an inclusive, diverse workplace dedicated to innovation and excellence


We are unfortunately not able to sponsor visa - for this role, you will need to possess an existing EU/German work permit.

Join us, and let's build something amazing together! 🚀

About the Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has got Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Develop and automate forecasting models to plan the capacity of the support centers across different locations.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track scheduling efficiency, occupancy rates, and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building forecasting models & time series analysis (Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters or similar).
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in Cost Analysis, What-if Scenario Analysis, Capacity planning, and Workforce Management is nice to have but not mandatory.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

About the Team

The Selection Analytics Team at Wolt owns the data and infrastructure that helps all 27 of our markets build a portfolio of high-quality restaurant and retail merchants. Our overarching mission is to provide the best selection to customers by enabling sales teams across all markets to acquire the best merchants.

To do this, we work directly with country sales teams to help them identify and prioritize the highest potential merchant candidates. We also work with Wolt leadership by providing metrics to track selection quality, upon which they develop strategic initiatives and goals. This is a lean and mighty team that owns and operates the engine for merchant acquisition globally.

About The Role

As a senior member of the Selection Analytics team, your role involves leveling up our approach to identifying and prioritizing better merchants. You’ll achieve this by a) developing metrics to unlock deeper insights into merchant selection quality for all markets b) developing and running experiments to understand the impact of selection on specific markets c) develop self-serve tooling to track these insights

This is also a rare, high-exposure experience where you will then use your findings to work directly with country leadership to help them uncover growth opportunities. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just crunching numbers and creating dashboards.

The team is looking for a versatile analytics expert who knows how to move fast, work cross-functionally, and deliver business results. If you are excited to build from 0 to 1, interested in global exposure, and have experience using deep analytics to solve hard problems - we're looking for someone like you.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these cities - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.

Our humble expectations


3-5 years of experience in data science, consulting, or related quantitative role
Strong exploratory data analysis skills, willingness to look under the hood.
Deep understanding of the data science workflow, including experimental design and key statistical methods, with strong communication skills for complex topics.
Proficiency in statistical programming languages (R, Python, etc.) and SQL.
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g. Looker)
Determination to initiate and lead/own strategic projects to completion in a scrappy environment with a cross-functional team
Innate curiosity to understand how things work and a first-principles approach to problem solving


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Lead - Marta Palac (marta.palac@wolt.com).

About Wolt

Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers. It connects people looking to order food and other goods with people interested in selling and delivering them. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions – as well as operating its own grocery stores under the Wolt Market brand. Wolt’s products include Wolt+ (subscription service for customers), Wolt for Work (meal benefits and office deliveries for companies), Wolt Drive (fast last-mile deliveries for merchants) and Wolt Self-Delivery (service for merchant partners with their own delivery staff). Wolt’s mission is to make cities better by empowering and growing local communities. Wolt was founded in 2014 and joined forces with DoorDash in 2022. DoorDash operates in 29 countries today, 25 of which are with the Wolt product and brand.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 700+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 60 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.

Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As an Economist at Deliveroo you will help scale our business and improve the experience for restaurants, riders, and eaters. Using experimental or observational data, you will get to help answer questions like:



Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the business impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
Can the Delivery food market sustain multiple players?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants?
What impact do online reviews have?
How will a change in the user interface affect customer choice behaviour?



The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Requirements:



Masters Degree or PhD in Economics or Econometrics (preferred)
Always curious and willing to learn new skills
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business-relevant economic problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
Proficiency with analytical tools like R/Python and familiarity with SQL
Ideally industry experience since the completion of your academic career
Excellent people skills — you’ll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into economic problems



At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. The scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Why Deliveroo

Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.

We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

Workplace & Benefits

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed.

Our vision is fast technology, fair service, and honest values. All at the tap of a phone, all the time.

We are about giving customers a new way to spend, save and manage their money while taking better care of the planet which has seen us become a multi-award winning bank that now employs over 2800 across five offices in London, Cardiff, Dublin, Southampton, and Manchester. Our journey started in 2014, and since then we have surpassed 3.5 million accounts (and four account types!) with 350,000 business customers. We are a fully licensed UK bank but at the heart, we are a tech first company, enabling our platform to deliver brilliant products.

Our technologists are at the very heart of Starling and enjoy working in a fast-paced environment that is all about building things, creating new stuff, and disruptive technology that keeps us on the cutting edge of fintech. We operate a flat structure to empower you to make decisions regardless of what your primary responsibilities may be, innovation and collaboration will be at the core of everything you do. Help is never far away in our open culture, you will find support in your team and from across the business, we are in this together!

The way to thrive and shine within Starling is to be a self-driven individual and be able to take full ownership of everything around you: From building things, designing, discovering, to sharing knowledge with your colleagues and making sure all processes are efficient and productive to deliver the best possible results for our customers. Our purpose is underpinned by five Starling values: Listen, Keep It Simple, Do The Right Thing, Own It, and Aim For Greatness.

Hybrid Working

We have a Hybrid approach to working here at Starling - our preference is that you're located within a commutable distance of one of our offices so that we're able to interact and collaborate in person. We don't like to mandate how much you visit the office and work from home, that's to be agreed upon between you and your manager.

We are looking for Data Scientists with experience working in Marketing to help the bank solve complex problems using Machine Learning. In this role, you'll use your skills and passion for data to understand our customers and drive growth through effective marketing strategies.

Responsibilites:

Develop and refine models to predict customer lifetime value (LTV) to optimise marketing investments and resource allocation.
Analyse customer behaviour and product usage data to identify target audiences and tailor marketing efforts for maximum impact.

Contribute to building and interpreting Marketing Mix Models (MMM) to understand the best growth activities.
Collaborate with Data Analysts to ensure they effectively utilise the models you build.



Requirements



We're open-minded when it comes to hiring and we care more about aptitude and attitude than specific experience or qualifications. We think the ideal candidate will encompass most of the following:

Solid understanding of customer lifetime value (LTV) modelling and marketing mix modelling.
Deep understanding of statistics, especially Bayesian reasoning, and the ability to assess the accuracy of your results.
Experience with causal inference concepts and machine learning models for causal inference.
Comfortable with a variety of modelling techniques, including gradient boosting, neural networks, linear regression, and blending these approaches.
Expert in Python with the ability to make well-reasoned design decisions in your code.
Comfortable working with external data sources through APIs.
Ability to see the bigger picture of business processes and clearly define how models can be integrated and add value.
Excellent communication and visualisation skills to effectively present your findings to different audiences.

Interview Process

Interviewing is a two way process and we want you to have the time and opportunity to get to know us, as much as we are getting to know you! Our interviews are conversational and we want to get the best from you, so come with questions and be curious. In general you can expect the below, following a chat with one of our Talent Team:

Stage 1 - 45 mins with one of the team
Stage 2 - Take home test
Stage 3 - 60 mins technical interview with two team members
Stage 4 - 45 min final with an executive and a member of the people team

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Ready to ? Who you are:


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.


Data Science is an integral component of Coinbase’s product and decision making process: we work in partnership with Product, Engineering and Design to influence the roadmap and better understand our users.

Design and guide experiments/analysis to measure impact and drive product improvements.
Develop and maintain key metrics and reports, enhancing data infrastructure for better analysis.


What We Look For In You

About The Role

At Tesco, our Data Science team focuses on modelling complex business problems and deploying data products at scale. Our work spans across multiple areas including physical stores, online, supply chain, marketing and Clubcard, where we encourage rotation amongst our Data Scientists so they can gain expertise in different subjects.

We work on several domains and problem types: online, pricing, security, fulfilment, distribution, property, IoT and computer vision are just some. Our team members spend 10% of their week on learning and personal development. Multiple academic collaborations enrich the team expertise; knowledge sharing events are regular. Furthermore, we have a great work-life balance, team days and relaxed but engaging culture.

You will be responsible for

This is a hands-on position where you will need to leverage your analytical mindset to find solutions to complex problems. As a Data Scientist, you will need to understand difficult business problems and prototype solutions with minimal support. Apply, modify and design algorithms and mathematical models to solve business problems on top of big data architectures (Hadoop, Spark) is a core component of the role. Our data scientists will need to be able to validate, document and present the modeling process and performances, as well as communicate complex solutions in a clear, understandable way to non-experts. Data Scientists are also responsible for promoting data science across Tesco and promote Tesco across the external Data Science community.

You will need

We are looking for ambitious individuals with a mix of statistics, programming, and machine learning skills. The role requires that you have an extensive background in machine learning and data mining. A track record in modifying and designing advanced algorithms and applying them to large data sets is essential.

An ideal candidate will have a scientific mentality with the ability to ask the right questions, as well as answer them. A strong numerical higher degree in a mathematical, scientific, engineering or computer science discipline is preferable, as well as a solid understanding of mathematics and statistical principles.

Experience in one or more of the following fields is required: predictive modelling, operational research, deep learning, and time series modelling. Finally, strong programming experience (Python is preferred).

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is a global management consulting firm and the world’s leading advisor on business strategy. We partner with clients from the private, public, and not-for-profit sectors in all regions to identify their highest-value opportunities, address their most critical challenges, and transform their enterprises. Our customized approach combines deep insight into the dynamics of companies and markets with close collaboration at all levels of the client organization. This ensures that our clients achieve sustainable competitive advantage, build more capable organizations, and secure lasting results. Founded in 1963, BCG is a private company with offices in more than 90 cities in 50 countries. For more information, please visit bcg.com.

BCG’s clients are the world’s top business leaders. From computers to retailing, our professional expertise spans over 50 industries. The vast majority of our clients rank among the 500 largest companies in each of our three major regions–Americas (North and South), Europe Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Additionally, we work with a number of small- to medium-sized companies, both public and private.

The success of our assignments routinely leads our clients to maintain long-term relationships with us. Over 85 percent of our revenues come from clients who continue to work with us from one year to the next to maintain the momentum for change and to continually improve bottom-line results they have achieved with our help.

We pride ourselves on our fresh thinking. Our evolving ideas profoundly change the way most businesses think about competition. Many leading business concepts over the past three decades originated with BCG–including, experience curve, time-based competition, Segment-of-One® marketing, deconstruction, and trading up. Our recent Collateral Damage publication series has addressed the implications for managers of the on-going financial crisis.

We believe that no other consulting organization has concentrated as thoroughly on understanding business competition and helping companies make the changes necessary to succeed in increasingly competitive markets.

La réputation mondiale du cabinet de conseil en gestion Boston Consulting Group (BCG), comme l'un des meilleurs en gestion, découle de plus de cinquante années d'expérience à aider les cadres supérieurs à découvrir et réaliser tout le potentiel de leur entreprise. Notre mission consiste à appuyer nos clients à réaliser des avantages concurrentiels durables en offrant des solutions personnalisées. Nous croyons fermement qu'il faut travailler avec nos clients, pas à leurs dépens. Nous collaborons avec chaque client pour l'aider à prendre une direction et à faire face aux défis organisationnels et opérationnels.

Fondé en 1963, BCG compte maintenant plus de 11,000 experts-conseils, et ce, dans plus de 90 bureaux dans le monde entier. Les clients du BCG sont les dirigeants des plus importantes entreprises du monde. Des ordinateurs jusqu'à la vente au détail, notre expertise professionnelle s'étend à plus de 50 industries. La grande majorité de nos clients figurent parmi les 500 plus grandes entreprises dans chacune de nos trois régions principales – Les Amériques (nord et sud), l'Europe (incluant le Moyen-Orient et l'Afrique) et l'Asie-Pacifique. De plus, nous travaillons avec un certain nombre de petites et moyennes entreprises, tant publiques que privées.

Notre succès, provenant des mandats qui nous sont assignés, nous permet d'établir des relations à long terme avec nos clients. Plus de 85 pourcents de nos revenus proviennent de clients qui continuent à travailler avec nous d'une année à l'autre pour conserver l'élan de changement et pour améliorer continuellement les résultats nets qu'ils ont réalisés grâce à notre aide.

Nous sommes fiers de notre approche innovatrice. Nos idées évolutives changent profondément la manière dont la plupart des entreprises considèrent la concurrence. Plusieurs des principaux concepts d'affaires, au cours des trois dernières décennies, ont commencé avec BCG, y compris la courbe d'apprentissage, la concurrence calculée sur le temps, le marketing Segment-of-One®, le démantèlement et l'extension ascendante. Nos récentes publications de la série Collateral Damage ont traité de l'implication des dirigeants face à la crise financière en cours.

Nous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

The vast majority of our clients rank among the 500 largest companies in each of our three major regions–Americas (North and South), Europe Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific.

Many leading business concepts over the past three decades originated with BCG–including, experience curve, time-based competition, Segment-of-One® marketing, deconstruction, and trading up. Our recent Collateral Damage publication series has addressed the implications for managers of the on-going financial crisis.

We believe that no other consulting organization has concentrated as thoroughly on understanding business competition and helping companies make the changes necessary to succeed in increasingly competitive markets.

Plusieurs des principaux concepts d'affaires, au cours des trois dernières décennies, ont commencé avec BCG, y compris la courbe d'apprentissage, la concurrence calculée sur le temps, le marketing Segment-of-One®, le démantèlement et l'extension ascendante. Nos récentes publications de la série Collateral Damage ont traité de l'implication des dirigeants face à la crise financière en cours.

Nous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Machine Learning Infrastructure group at Stripe aims to provide state of the art infrastructure and support for building and operationalizing AI/ML models for all business verticals within the company, including but not limited to models that mitigate risks across Stripe’s products and services globally, and models that help our customers to fight fraud by leveraging Stripe’s user facing products like Radar and Identity. ML is a top priority for Stripe in the coming years. With the phenomenal developments happening in the field of AI, we are positioned to accelerate the adoption of AI/ML across all parts of the company by building highly scalable and reliable foundational infrastructure.

What you’ll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching machine learning models using tools such as XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch.
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly impact Stripe’s top line metrics.
Propose new feature ideas and design data pipelines to incorporate them into our models
Improve the way we evaluate and monitor our model and system performance
Collaborate with stakeholders and drive end-to-end projects involving a variety of technologies and systems to successful completion.



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


At least 5 years of industry experience doing end-to-end ML development on a machine learning team and bringing ML models to production
Advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. computer science, statistics, physics, …)
Proficient in Python, Scala, Spark



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Hands-on applied ML (model training, deployment to production, etc) experience
You keep up-to-date on the latest in AI engineering practices and research
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data
Knowledge about how to manipulate data to perform analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to evaluate a hypothesis.
Experience evaluating niche and upcoming ML solutions



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.<br><br>A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office.

We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.<br><br>Pay and benefits<br><br>The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.<br><br>Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Machine Learning Infrastructure group at Stripe aims to provide state of the art infrastructure and support for building and operationalizing AI/ML models for all business verticals within the company, including but not limited to models that mitigate risks across Stripe’s products and services globally, and models that help our customers to fight fraud by leveraging Stripe’s user facing products like Radar and Identity. ML is a top priority for Stripe in the coming years. With the phenomenal developments happening in the field of AI, we are positioned to accelerate the adoption of AI/ML across all parts of the company by building highly scalable and reliable foundational infrastructure.

What you’ll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching machine learning models using tools such as XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch.
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly impact Stripe’s top line metrics.
Propose new feature ideas and design data pipelines to incorporate them into our models
Improve the way we evaluate and monitor our model and system performance
Collaborate with stakeholders and drive end-to-end projects involving a variety of technologies and systems to successful completion.



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


At least 5 years of industry experience doing end-to-end ML development on a machine learning team and bringing ML models to production
Advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. computer science, statistics, physics, …)
Proficient in Python, Scala, Spark



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Hands-on applied ML (model training, deployment to production, etc) experience
You keep up-to-date on the latest in AI engineering practices and research
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data
Knowledge about how to manipulate data to perform analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to evaluate a hypothesis.
Experience evaluating niche and upcoming ML solutions



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Tecton’s feature platform makes it simple to activate data for smarter models and predictions. Tecton abstracts away the complex engineering to speed up innovation.

Tecton’s founders developed the first Feature Store when they created Uber’s Michelangelo ML platform, and we’re now bringing those same capabilities to every organization in the world.

Tecton is funded by Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Kleiner Perkins, along with strategic investments from Snowflake and Databricks. We have a fast-growing team that’s distributed around the world, with offices in San Francisco and New York City. Our team has years of experience building and operating business-critical machine learning systems at leading tech companies like Uber, Google, Meta, Airbnb, Lyft, and Twitter.

We are building Rift - a new fully managed compute environment that allows data scientists to construct powerful batch and streaming feature pipelines in Python. This differs radically from technologies like Spark, which have a steep learning curve and significant overhead to manage, operate, and debug. Our new environment leverages popular open-source technologies such as Ray, Arrow, and DuckDB.

As a staff-level engineer building Tecton’s managed compute, you’ll play a critical role in architecting, designing, and scaling our first-ever managed compute platform that will serve as a compute engine used by every Tecton customer. As part of this team, you will be working in one or more of the following areas to build the next generation of Tecton infrastructure:


Distributed compute and resource management
Query optimization and distributed execution
Cross-platform integrations with state-of-the-art data platforms such as Snowflake and BigQuery
Fault-tolerant workloads on a lambda-based architecture
Data security


Responsibilities


Own and lead large technical domains starting from the problem definition and technical requirements along with implementation and maintenance
Lead multi-engineer projects of strategic importance to Tecton spanning cross-functional teams including design, product management, and other engineering teams
Drive efforts to improve engineering practices, tooling, and processes along with mentorship for senior engineers
Develop a deep understanding of the fundamental problems our customers face in building ML systems
Be a generalist as needed. We’re a small, but growing engineering team and each engineer needs to be versatile
Reinforce Tecton’s “Fast, but Focused” core value


Qualifications And Values


7+ years of experience in building product software systems
2+ years of technical leadership experience for a group of engineers
Experience working in large Python, Java, Kotlin, or Go codebases and running cloud-native production systems using Kubernetes, AWS, and Docker
Experience with distributed systems, SQL, and NoSQL databases
Bias to action and passion for delivering high-quality solutions
Strong communication and ability to write detailed technical specifications
Excitement about coaching and mentorship of junior engineers
BSc, MS or PhD in Computer Science or related fields


$216,000 - $258,000 a year

The estimated US base salary range for this position is $216,000 - $258,000 annually for employees based within California & New York. In addition to base salary, we offer competitive equity & comprehensive benefits such as medical, dental, vision, life, 401(K), flexible paid time off, 10 paid holidays each calendar year, sick time, leave of absence as per the FMLA and other relevant leave laws.
