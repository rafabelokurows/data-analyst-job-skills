At Promaton, we're revolutionizing dental healthcare with AI, and we need your expertise. See our company page to learn more about what we do.

As a Software Engineer in Machine Learning you will be working closely with our platform and product teams, enabling fast iterations and scalable ML solutions for existing and future products. You will extend our already successful track record of 5 ML products processing thousands of cases weekly for over 1K customers.




As part of our dynamic team, you will be:

Improving and contributing to the design and architecture of a complex set of interdependent ML pipelines.
Following MLOps best practices by maintaining and extending our CI/CD pipelines, dashboards, dev/test/prod environments, autoscaling, etc.
Working with an accomplished team of machine learning researchers and engineers that already have 8 patents on their name.
Helping researchers launch new products and help maintain the ones already used by customers.

Some initiatives on our MLOps roadmap for the next months:

1. Improving speed and robustness of multiple machine learning products

2. Continuous monitoring of incoming data in production

The challenges you’ll face:

All our products process large data points, ranging from 5 up to 700MB. This means that a lot of off-the-shelf tooling doesn't work for us, and we need to invent our own to process and manage our data.
Our teams are growing and so is our code base. This comes with the challenge to keep it well-designed and maintainable.
We are a cloud-native company, and cloud-native ML frameworks are still in their early days. You'll help us navigate the ever-evolving ecosystem of tools, to make sure we find the right balance between off-the-shelf and home-grown tooling.
Medical AI has to comply with the highest quality standards. While in other industries failing to predict for example a recommended product has little consequence, in the medical field you don't want to be wrong.




The perks of working at Promaton:

💰 Attractive salary package, and excellent employment terms

🏡 Excellent work/life balance. Freedom to work from home or anywhere you like (and any time you like). We only have a few touchpoints.

👩‍🔬 Dedicated time for hackathons and growth, to explore new ideas of your own. Every quarter we have a hackathon week where you can work on anything you like to expand your skill set!

🙌 Staying up to date with the latest happenings in the ML field can be hard. That is why we organize monthly paper review sessions to discuss the latest developments in the field to stay up to date with the current state-of-the-art. Next to that we regularly hold “ML Sparring Sessions” where you can spar with other MLRs in the company on potential directions for projects you are working on.

🎓 Real training budget for books and conferences or anything else you need to grow

🚀 Work with the latest technology, at the forefront of a rapidly developing field in medical imaging AI. Checkout our techstack here.

💪 Loads of responsibility and autonomy (we hate micromanagement) and a chance to make a real impact

🏖 Awesome yearly company retreat, and quarterly team events

⛺️ 32 days of annual leave

💻 Top-notch gear, and even bigger servers to play with

🏄‍♂️ Promaton is funded for many years to come, meaning you can have the impact you only get at a startup, but with the job security of an established company

🛬 For international engineers, based in the NL (already relocated to the Netherlands) we are able to offer visa sponsorship

🎈Inclusive environment, we value and celebrate diversity




Job requirements

4+ years experience working with Python and Pytorch
Solid understanding of software development best practices
A passion for software and ML pipeline design concepts
The git ecosystem is your natural habitat
Know how good tests improve developer velocity
Experience with continuous deployment of live products
Experience with AWS/GCP/Azure or Kubernetes deployment
Good collaboration and communication skills

Bonus points:

Experience with experiment, model and data tracking
Knowledge of machine learning fundamentals
Worked with 3D data, like meshes and point clouds
Experience working asynchronously with a distributed team
Previous experience in medical or other regulated field




We're excited to see how you can make a difference in our team. If you're passionate about making a tangible impact in healthcare through AI, we'd love to hear from you!

Grâce au machine learning (ML) et l'intelligence artificielle (IA), vous générez des produits basés sur les data et vous menez à bien les défis opérationnels les plus urgents.

Votre job en deux mots

Vous contribuez à des projets transversaux dans le AI Lab au sein d'une équipe jeune, dynamique et innovante. Sur le plan IT, le AI Lab collabore avec l’équipe de AI Engineering afin de réaliser les projets IA end-to-end.

Vous utilisez divers types de data, internes et externes, structurées et non structurées, pour améliorer les use cases existants et en lancer de nouveaux. Cela peut se faire pour toutes les activités bancaires et d'assurances : Marketing, Compliance, Risk, fraude, ALM, automatisation des processus…

Votre tâche est très variée :


Vous développez/améliorez des modèles de prévision à l’aide de techniques statistiques et du machine learning.
Vous utilisez des large language models ou d'autres modèles d'IA générative pour fournir des solutions concrètes aux besoins commerciaux.
Vous établissez, analysez et interprétez des hypothèses business et vous exploitez des datasets.
Vous recommandez des idées au business à l’aide de visualisations/algorithmes prévisionnels lorsque des data/résultats sont disponibles.
Vous aidez les utilisateurs à comprendre les principes de la science des données et, si nécessaire, vous commentez les comportements du modèle et les actions de correction possibles.



Pas besoin d’être un oiseau rare

Chez nous, vous pouvez vous distinguer et révéler le meilleur de vous-même si vous répondez aux critères suivants :


Vous avez un master ou un doctorat en sciences, avec d’excellents résultats universitaires sur le plan technique (économétrie, sciences informatiques, intelligence artificielle, etc.).
Vous êtes expert dans les techniques de machine learning et vous êtes disposé à actualiser cette connaissance. Une connaissance approfondie d’algorithmes tels que Random Forests, Neural Networks et Reinforcement Learning est un must.
Vous disposez de solides aptitudes de programmation en Python et SQL.
Vous maîtrisez le français ou le néerlandais et vous avez une connaissance passive de l’autre langue, et de l’anglais.
Grâce à vos compétences narratives et à votre aptitude à visualiser des données, vous êtes capable d’expliquer des analyses complexes à un public profane. Vous disposez d’excellentes capacités de communication écrite et orale au niveau technique et business.
Vous avez soif de connaissances, non seulement pour maîtriser de nouveaux algorithmes et technologies, mais aussi sur le plan interpersonnel. Vous êtes conscient que la valeur de votre travail est synonyme de qualité et d’acceptation et vous tenez à combiner ces deux aspects.
Vous disposez d’une capacité exceptionnelle pour résoudre les problèmes : vous savez qu'une bonne compréhension du problème représente au moins 90% de la solution, vous faites preuve de créativité et de ténacité pour approfondir les problèmes et chercher des solutions.



Vous marquerez encore plus de points si :


Vous êtes bilingue (français/néerlandais).
Vous avez de l’expérience dans le développement de produits data, de la conception à la production.
Vous disposez d'une expérience antérieure du IA générative et/ou Natural Language Processing.
Vous connaissez Spark et les libraries/tools pour les visualisations (comme Plotly/Dash).
Vous avez des notions du cloud, de préférence Azure.



Belfius prend soin de ses talents

Outre la possibilité de faire votre chemin dans un job qui vous plaît, nous vous offrons un contrat à temps plein à durée indéterminée avec :

Conheça os principais pilares da nossa cultura

Ética: Sem isso, não tem conversa. Com esse pilar, tudo o que queremos construir será sólido, duradouro e verdadeiro. Fazemos o que é correto. 

Exercemos a arte de discordar: Perguntamos “por que” antes de discordar e não nos apaixonamos pelos próprios argumentos. Assim podemos compreender para discordar e construir a melhor solução. 

Escolhemos o frescobol: Aqui ninguém ganha sozinho. Quando uma pessoa erra, o outro arredonda a bola. É uma ralação ganha-ganha. 

Autorcracia: Autorcracia significa ter liberdade com responsabilidade. Se a empresa fosse minha eu faria isso?  

Bom humor: Bom humor é fundamental. O clima bom e descontraído favorece as relações, a criatividade e a inovação. Mas apelou, perdeu. 

Desafiar o status quo: Dá para fazer diferente? Sempre dá. E pode ser simples. Temos paixão por transformar e evoluir.

É uma ralação ganha-ganha. <br><br><strong>Autorcracia:</strong> Autorcracia significa ter liberdade com responsabilidade. Se a empresa fosse minha eu faria isso?  <br><br><strong>Bom humor:</strong> Bom humor é fundamental. O clima bom e descontraído favorece as relações, a criatividade e a inovação.

No C6 Bank, celebramos o diálogo, a abertura e, sobretudo, o respeito. Estamos construindo, no nosso dia a dia e nos nossos processos seletivos, uma cultura que valoriza e respeita a diversidade de pessoas. Aqui, cada indivíduo tem o poder da autorcracia, é incentivado a desafiar o quo e a criar coisas incríveis.

Conheça os principais pilares da nossa cultura

Ética: Sem isso, não tem conversa. Com esse pilar, tudo o que queremos construir será sólido, duradouro e verdadeiro. Fazemos o que é correto. 

Exercemos a arte de discordar: Perguntamos “por que” antes de discordar e não nos apaixonamos pelos próprios argumentos. Assim podemos compreender para discordar e construir a melhor solução. 

Escolhemos o frescobol: Aqui ninguém ganha sozinho. Quando uma pessoa erra, o outro arredonda a bola. É uma ralação ganha-ganha. 

Autorcracia: Autorcracia significa ter liberdade com responsabilidade. Se a empresa fosse minha eu faria isso?  

Bom humor: Bom humor é fundamental. O clima bom e descontraído favorece as relações, a criatividade e a inovação. Mas apelou, perdeu. 

Desafiar o status quo: Dá para fazer diferente? Sempre dá. E pode ser simples. Temos paixão por transformar e evoluir.

Conheça os principais pilares da nossa cultura

Ética: Sem isso, não tem conversa. Com esse pilar, tudo o que queremos construir será sólido, duradouro e verdadeiro. Fazemos o que é correto. 

Exercemos a arte de discordar: Perguntamos “por que” antes de discordar e não nos apaixonamos pelos próprios argumentos. Assim podemos compreender para discordar e construir a melhor solução. 

Escolhemos o frescobol: Aqui ninguém ganha sozinho. Quando uma pessoa erra, o outro arredonda a bola. É uma ralação ganha-ganha. 

Autorcracia: Autorcracia significa ter liberdade com responsabilidade. Se a empresa fosse minha eu faria isso?  

Bom humor: Bom humor é fundamental. O clima bom e descontraído favorece as relações, a criatividade e a inovação. Mas apelou, perdeu. 

Desafiar o status quo: Dá para fazer diferente? Sempre dá. E pode ser simples. Temos paixão por transformar e evoluir.

Quale sarà la tua sfida? 

Bip ha creato all’interno del proprio Competence Centre “xTech” il più nutrito gruppo di Data Scientist in Italia (fonte: statistiche LinkedIn), e dall’Italia coordina anche i propri gruppi di Data Scientist locali presso le proprie sedi estere. 

Nell’ambito della continua crescita ed evoluzione di questo effervescente gruppo, che opera sui nostri clienti in tutti i settori, e ci ha consentito di introdurre l’Intelligenza Artificiale presso le realtà enterprise più importanti d’Italia, siamo alla ricerca sia di profili junior/intermediate (dai neolaureati a profili con almeno 2 anni di esperienza), sia profili middle-senior (dai 3 ai 5 anni di esperienza). La provenienza da società di consulenza direzionale o informatica sarà considerata un forte plus. 

Il/La Data Scientist in Bip evolve non solo le proprie competenze di AI e Machine Learning, ma anche la comprensione dei fenomeni legati al Business dei nostri Clienti e le proprie capacità di tradurli in algoritmi e poi di comunicare e utilizzare i risultati degli stessi per migliorare ed efficientare i processi. 

I/Le nostri/e Data Scientist verranno introdotti in contesti progettuali dove comprenderanno le esigenze del Cliente, daranno indicazione ai Data Engineer sulla preparazione desiderata dei dati, sceglieranno o costruiranno i migliori mix di modelli più adatti al caso specifico, discuteranno gli output con il cliente e consegneranno il modello per l’ottimizzazione e passaggio in produzione finale ai Data Engineer. 

In contesti più semplificati in cui la componente di Data Engineering è meno elaborata, i nostri Data Scientist procederanno in autonomia anche nella data preparation e nel porting in produzione dei modelli ingegnerizzati. 

Oltre alle progettualità, ai/alle Data Scientist sarà richiesto un contributo attivo per alimentare la Community con attività di ricerca, scouting, concept di nuove soluzioni e business development.

DATA SCIENTIST – GENERATIVE AI SPECIALIST

Entra nel nostro mondo.

Trasforma insieme a noi.

Quale sarà la tua sfida?

Bip ha creato all’interno del proprio Competence Centre “xTech” il più nutrito gruppo di Data Scientist in Italia (fonte: statistiche LinkedIn), e dall’Italia coordina anche i propri gruppi di Data Scientist locali presso le proprie sedi estere.

Nell’ambito della continua crescita ed evoluzione di questo effervescente gruppo, che opera sui nostri clienti in tutti i settori, e ci ha consentito di introdurre l’Intelligenza Artificiale presso le realtà enterprise più importanti d’Italia, siamo alla ricerca sia di profili junior/intermediate (dai neolaureati a profili con almeno 2 anni di esperienza), sia profili middle-senior (dai 3 ai 6 anni di esperienza). La provenienza da società di consulenza direzionale o informatica sarà considerata un forte plus.

Il/La Generative AI Specialist in Bip evolve non solo le proprie competenze nei modelli di Generative AI, ma anche la comprensione dei fenomeni legati al Business dei nostri Clienti e le proprie capacità di tradurli in soluzioni e poi di comunicare e utilizzare i risultati degli stessi per migliorare ed efficientare i processi.

I/Le nostri/e Generative AI Specialists verranno introdotti in contesti progettuali dove per la maggior parte i dati sono non strutturati (testi, immagini, video, suoni) e il cui focus diventa la comprensione, il processamento e la generazione partendo da tali basi documentali altrimenti non processabili con le classiche tecniche di Data Science.

I contesti progettuali spaziano dall’utilizzo di modelli pre-addestrati (es. LLM) fino all’addestramento di nuovi modelli di Generative AI passando dal fine-tuning e absorption learning da modelli commerciali.

Oltre alle progettualità, ai/alle Generative AI Specialist sarà richiesto un contributo attivo per alimentare la Community con attività di ricerca, scouting, concept di nuove soluzioni e business development.
