We are helping our early stage (Pre-Seed -> Series B) portfolio companies grow their teams.

One of our portfolio companies is looking to hire a business-oriented data scientist to help accelerate their growth and product initiatives. They are focused on candidates with prior startup experience. They run a hybrid-work environment, and you will be expected to be in their office 3 days a week.

While being good at what you do are table stakes, we believe the following will make you successful in a startup:


Optimistic individuals are persistent, determined, and unwilling to give up in the face of adversity. They keep working towards a goal or objective despite setbacks or failures. Optimism often involves a combination of perseverance, resilience, and determination.
Growth-oriented individuals embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a key to success. They are willing to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. Growth-oriented individuals are curious, see learning as a lifelong process, and embrace feedback. They are willing to try new things, and are not afraid to change direction if something isn‚Äôt working.
Effective individuals collaborate well, work consistently and purposefully towards achieving their goals, efficiently manage their time, and are self-motivated. They are able to identify problems, analyze them critically, and develop effective solutions.


Please note that many early stage startups are unable to sponsor visas of any kinds (ie, no transfers, no sponsoring of student visas, or no sponsoring of new visas).

Bachelors in Computer Science, Math, Physics, or other technical field, MS/PhD a plus
Comfortable with ambiguity and moving pieces - we're growing fast
Ability to communicate your analysis with clarity and precision to both technical and non-technical teams

Experience with Git, code reviews, and coordination frameworks (e.g. Airflow)
Working knowledge of at least one modeling framework (e.g. scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
Experience with short, medium, and long-term forecasts to understand the likely growth trajectory of our company



Every Snowflake employee is expected to follow the company‚Äôs confidentiality and security standards for handling sensitive data.
