Energieversorger unterstützen wir ganzheitlich mit teils individuellen Enterprise-Lösungen. Für die damit verbundenen Aufgaben brauchen wir Menschen, die den Startup-Geist in sich tragen und Lust haben, unser Geschäft und den noch jungen Markt der digitalen Wärmeplanung maßgeblich mitzugestalten.

Wir suchen dich als Data Scientist (m/w/d) für die digitale Wärmeplanung

Gemeinsam mit dem LBD-Team „Digital“ stellst du dich der Herausforderung, uns als Unternehmen sowie unsere Kunden und Partner aus dem Bereich der „Digitalen Wärmeplanung“ dazu zu befähigen, ein datengetriebenes Unternehmen zu werden.

Aufgaben


Du entwickelst und pflegst Routinen zur Metadaten­ex­tra­ktion aus Mediendaten.
Du erstellst und verwaltest Jobs zur automatischen Daten­verarbeitung für Raster- und Vektordatensätze (z.B. reprojection, merging, photogrammetry).
Du konzipierst, entwickelst und betreibst (Geo-)Daten­banken und darauf aufbauende (Geo-)APIs
Du entwickelst mit dem Team effiziente und durch­dachte End-To-End Lösungen in einer dynamischen und agilen Arbeitsumgebung nach der Scrum-Methode.


Profil


Abgeschlossenes Hochschulstudium (idealerweise in einer stark quantitativen Disziplin, wie z. B. der Fachrichtungen Geowissenschaft, Ingenieurswissenschaft, (Geo-)Informatik, Mathematik oder Physik) oder eine vergleichbare Qualifikation.
Du bringst eine starke Affinität für Daten, Daten­struk­turen, -prozesse und Algorithmen mit, hast demnach ein sehr ausgeprägtes analytisches Denk­ver­mögen. Zu­dem kommt Dein besonderes Interesse, Deine Eigen­schaften und Fähigkeiten in gesellschaftlich aktuelle wie hochrelevante Themen­gebiete, wie z. B. der „Energie- und Wärmewende“ gewinnbringend einzubringen.
Du verfügst über umfassende Fachkenntnisse zur An­wen­­dung von GIS-Systemen (QGIS) und bringst idealer­weise auch profunde Berufserfahrung in der Durch­führung von GIS-Projekten
Du bringst fundierte Vorerfahrung mit Python und eine Leidenschaft für sauberes Design mit.
Du hast bereits mit verschiedenen Datenbanktypen gear­beitet (Geo, SQL, NoSQL, Vektor) und das Wissen darüber, wann welche Art der Technologie sinnvoll eingesetzt werden kann und wie die Datenhaltung und Zugriffe effizient und sicher gestaltet werden können.
Du arbeitest gerne selbstständig und lösungsorientiert, stets dem eigenen Anspruch folgend, den best­mög­lichen Datenbestand, Automatisierungsprozess oder Digitalisierungsgrad einer Aufgabenstellung zu finden und umzusetzen

About the New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt, the best place to order groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, and other retail goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!) 🚀

About The New Verticals Analytics Team

Our New Verticals Analytics team sits at the intersection of product development, strategic planning, and operational execution. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design, and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions, to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience that combines scientific expertise with stakeholder engagement. When you join this team, you will be taking ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from the ground up, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we want you on our team.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
4+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis using statistical software packages in Python or R.

About Us

mediaire was founded in 2018 by Dr. Andreas Lemke and Dr. Jörg Döpfert – both physicists with a background in MRI physics.

The real founding history, however, dates back to 2009 when the scientific paths of Andreas and Jörg crossed several times with the renowned radiologist Prof. Henrik Michaely. Coming from different backgrounds and discovering that each had the same goal, the idea of a scientifically and economically successful high-tech product took shape – a software powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that allows highly efficient analysis of medical imaging data in Radiology to support radiologists in their daily routine.

We aim to be a frontrunner in pay equality/equity. We have a bold vision on fairness, transparency and are impact driven in our way of rewarding. We believe that people should be paid based on their impact they make for the company and not their gender, background or negotiation skills. We provide attractive salary packages for your expertise and an optimised benefits program where we stay true to our caring and learning goals. In a nutshell, we've built a place where we truly love working, we think you will too.

In Europe, we are a team of more than 300 employees working in eight offices in Germany, Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris and Zurich. When the stakes are high for our clients, especially in critical and complex situations, we safeguard their reputation and advance dialogue with key stakeholders on their behalf. Our approach is integrated, our teams are diverse with experience from journalism, corporate communications, digital communications, politics and investor relations.




The way we communicate is undergoing a fundamental change. This also applies to our clients, who find themselves confronted with entirely new stakeholder groups. In our Stakeholder Intelligence & Engagement Team, we assist our clients in understanding their stakeholders through quantitative and qualitative data analysis and in reaching them with tailored strategies across all communicative touchpoints, convincing them of our clients' objectives.




Join our Berlin team as (Junior) Full Stack Data Scientist.




What tasks can you look forward to?




Processing, cleaning, transforming and analyzing vast amounts of complex data, be it with standard, locally-trained AI models and ML algorithms, cutting-edge LLMs and other APIs, or other data mining procedures.




Conveying the results of such analyses to audiences with different backgrounds: from business and communication experts, to data scientists, statisticians, and mathematicians, in the form of formal non-technical presentations, rigorous written reports, or informal conversations.

What should you bring along?




You are a motivated data scientist that is passionate about both data quality and code quality, graduated in an area that relies heavily on data and quantitative research.




You are proficient in the standard Python data science stack (e.g. numpy, scipy, sklearn, pandas) and have proven experience, or an eagerness to learn about, classical and modern NLP techniques.




You have proven experience in, or an eagerness to learn about, disciplines that complement the standard data science skillset, such as data engineering, software engineering, DevOps, MLOps, prompt engineering, QA/testing, etc.




You are open to learning new techniques, languages, tools, and theories that will enrich your knowledge base about data science and beyond.




Proven knowledge of Python is required, and will be demonstrated during the interview process. Experience in SQL, Javascript, or LookML is desirable.




You communicate fluently in written and spoken English.




You love variety and new challenges and really thrive when working in a team.







What we can offer you




Highly attractive starting salary




An inspiring working environment as well as the opportunity to work at one of our international offices for a limited period of time




Exciting tasks and attractive development prospects




Induction and individual support from an experienced colleague




Deepening of your expertise with regard to different sectors and areas of competence through close cooperation of our integrated project teams




Continuous training opportunities (FGS Global Academy)




A dedicated, supportive and growing team




A corporate culture that combines excellence with team spirit




The opportunity to work flexibly both in our offices and from home




Don’t meet every single requirement? Please don’t worry! Studies have shown that some groups like women or people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single requirement. At FGS Global, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. So, if you’re excited about this role and our company but your previous professional experience doesn’t match perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we would like to encourage you to apply anyway. You may just be the right candidate for this or another role.




We look forward to your complete application (incl. all relevant academic and professional certificates and/or reference letters). Feel free to contact our HR team at +49 69 92 18 74-28 or by email at careers-eu@fgsglobal.com.

We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Senior Data Scientist in Aignostic's foundation model team you will work on our self-supervised base models. Together with collaborators in academia and industry you will push the state of the art in large-scale machine learning for digital pathology. Within our team of experts on large-scale machine learning and data handling, you will work on improving, benchmarking and extending our family of best-in-class foundations models, bridging image, text and other pathology data modalities. Moreover, using our foundation models you will contribute to developing prototypes for new applications to assist pathologists and generate new insights for improving cancer treatment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

About the Team

The Selection Analytics Team at Wolt owns the data and infrastructure that helps all 27 of our markets build a portfolio of high-quality restaurant and retail merchants. Our overarching mission is to provide the best selection to customers by enabling sales teams across all markets to acquire the best merchants.

To do this, we work directly with country sales teams to help them identify and prioritize the highest potential merchant candidates. We also work with Wolt leadership by providing metrics to track selection quality, upon which they develop strategic initiatives and goals. This is a lean and mighty team that owns and operates the engine for merchant acquisition globally.

About The Role

As a senior member of the Selection Analytics team, your role involves leveling up our approach to identifying and prioritizing better merchants. You’ll achieve this by a) developing metrics to unlock deeper insights into merchant selection quality for all markets b) developing and running experiments to understand the impact of selection on specific markets c) develop self-serve tooling to track these insights

This is also a rare, high-exposure experience where you will then use your findings to work directly with country leadership to help them uncover growth opportunities. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just crunching numbers and creating dashboards.

The team is looking for a versatile analytics expert who knows how to move fast, work cross-functionally, and deliver business results. If you are excited to build from 0 to 1, interested in global exposure, and have experience using deep analytics to solve hard problems - we're looking for someone like you.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these cities - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.

Our humble expectations


3-5 years of experience in data science, consulting, or related quantitative role
Strong exploratory data analysis skills, willingness to look under the hood.
Deep understanding of the data science workflow, including experimental design and key statistical methods, with strong communication skills for complex topics.
Proficiency in statistical programming languages (R, Python, etc.) and SQL.
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g. Looker)
Determination to initiate and lead/own strategic projects to completion in a scrappy environment with a cross-functional team
Innate curiosity to understand how things work and a first-principles approach to problem solving


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Lead - Marta Palac (marta.palac@wolt.com).

About Wolt

Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers. It connects people looking to order food and other goods with people interested in selling and delivering them. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions – as well as operating its own grocery stores under the Wolt Market brand. Wolt’s products include Wolt+ (subscription service for customers), Wolt for Work (meal benefits and office deliveries for companies), Wolt Drive (fast last-mile deliveries for merchants) and Wolt Self-Delivery (service for merchant partners with their own delivery staff). Wolt’s mission is to make cities better by empowering and growing local communities. Wolt was founded in 2014 and joined forces with DoorDash in 2022. DoorDash operates in 29 countries today, 25 of which are with the Wolt product and brand.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 700+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 60 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together.

At Trade Republic, we are on a mission to empower everyone to create wealth with easy, safe and free access to the financial system. With over four million customers we are the largest savings platforms in Europe, with users holding over €35 billion on our platform.

We are seen as the go-to-destination for top talent from across the globe. Everyday we strive to make Trade Republic a great environment to do the best work of your life, surrounded by exceptional, caring and passionate colleagues. In addition to learning and growing with a world-class team, you will build a destination for millions of people across Europe to create wealth.

About The Team

At Trade Republic, safeguarding our customers and fortifying our company against malicious actors isn't just a goal - it's an imperative.

Our Fincrime team leads the charge in proactively preventing, detecting, and halting any form of exploitation aimed at our products or our valued clientele. To achieve this, we recognize that data isn't just a resource - it's a cornerstone.

As a Senior Data Scientist on our Fincrime team, you're not just another cog in the machine. You are an integral part of a tight-knit team that truly owns the services and technical products it develops. You won't just build and maintain data products; you will have end-to-end ownership of them. This goes beyond mere maintenance or feature updates; it's about being fully accountable for your products' lifecycle - from ideation and scoping with product managers to final integration and ongoing evaluation with our engineering teams.

Please note that the position will either be based in London or Berlin, depending on your availability.

What You'll Be Doing


Own the Roadmap: Plan and execute the roadmap for your services together with the team
Architectural Influence: Play a pivotal role in designing the architecture of your data products, ensuring they are scalable, robust, and synergistic with our existing platforms.
Technical Excellence: Research, build, test and deploy models - this is where you will spend most of your time. With a focus on team ownership, this gives a lot of time for our developers and data scientists to actually work technically instead of with process.
Technical Leadership: Serve as a mentor to other engineers and establish yourself as a subject-matter expert within the team, lending your expertise to solve deeply complex issues in the fintech security landscape.
Accountability and Monitoring : Once deployed, you will continue to oversee your products, monitoring their performance metrics and making data-driven adjustments as needed to optimise results.


What We Are Looking For

We are aware that everyone has their individual strengths and weaknesses. The one thing where we don't compromise is joy for our work and dedication to our shared mission. If you feel you are not ticking all the boxes below, but have a good general feeling about most of them, we would be very happy to talk!


We recommend you have at least 5 years of end-to-end data science and software engineering experience, preferably in a dynamic environment with a modern tech stack
Experience working in the Financial domain, specifically significant experience in Anti Financial Crime is a must
Strong business acumen in the areas of finance and product
Exceptional interpersonal and communication skills, both with engineers and business stakeholders
Experience with applying a wide variety of machine learning techniques to business problems, particularly with tabular and natural language data
Strong command of SQL, Python together with its scientific stack (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
Good understanding of Software Engineering practices (e.g. test-driven development, OOP, CI/CD, etc.) and experience with productionizing ML products


WHY YOU SHOULD APPLY NOW

At Trade Republic you will get to do the best work of your career. We are a destination for people who are exceptional at what they do. Every day, we strive to build a world-class team and provide the space for people to do their best. We have a relentless ambition of raising the bar and expect the best from ourselves. Through our dedicated people-first management approach and transparent career paths, you will have the opportunity to develop and grow your career like never before. And because you are surrounded by a diverse team of high performers, you will be learning every day.

You will play an important role in fixing one of the largest challenges we face - closing the pension gap and democratizing wealth. Trade Republic is a place where your job, your career and your passions intersect. If this gets you fired up, just like it does for all of us at Trade Republic, then reach out!

Trade Republic embraces diversity and strives for equal opportunity for everyone. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, characteristics, perspectives and skills. We encourage applicants of diverse gender, age, sexuality, religion, ethnicity, disability status and parental status to apply to our roles, or those from other intersecting minority groups not listed. The more diverse and inclusive we are as a team, the greater our work will be.

We are embarking on Project NAFAS, a landmark 30 million EUR initiative set to revolutionize the field.

We are seeking an innovative and skilled scientist with at least 1-3 years of experience and a specific combination of skills: The ideal candidate has profound knowledge of probabilistic machine learning modelling and of the application of these methods in the realm of (adaptive) human-computer interaction.

This particular position will focus on the design and development of neuroadaptive systems, i.e., systems that can adapt to the user's cognitive and emotional states in real time, based on a number of simultaneously obtained streams of data. The data in question will include decoded brain activity, discrete event markers of incidents within the environment, and many other continuous or discrete data points providing additional contextual information stemming from a virtual or real-life setting. The successful applicant must have prior experience with handling various time-series data, and will focus, among other things, on: the efficient and effective co-registration of the data and developing a probabilistic modelling framework; the conceptualization, design, and implementation of a comprehensive general framework to automatically find patterns and regularities in this data; and the deployment of that same framework to enable existing HCI implementations to detect and respond to such regularities, making them neuroadaptive. The end goal of this development is to provide the functionality necessary to meaningfully enhance user experience across various applications based on decoded brain activity, even when the exact interaction is not known or intentionally left open at design time. Therefore, a large weight is placed on creativity and ability to find new data-driven and/or machine learning modelling frameworks as well as designing, implementing, and validating proof-of-concept applications.

The successful candidate will apply their expert knowledge of probabilistic machine learning modelling and interactive systems to, among other things,


develop mathematical and probabilistic models of human-computer interactions and user behaviours,
develop methods to perform automatic inference,
design and develop experiments, prototypes, and proof-of-concept applications to evaluate, validate, and refine the developed methods,
write computer code, design experiments, and coordinate the necessary data acquisition,
conduct extensive research into existing HCI and adaptive systems,
collaborate with experts in different fields, including neuroscience, computer science, and machine learning to bring this technology closer to the market,
identify key use cases of emerging neuroadaptive capabilities,
stay abreast of the latest developments in HCI, neuroadaptive technology, and related fields.
Advanced degree in related field.

Our approach is integrated, our teams are diverse with experience from journalism, corporate communications, digital communications, politics and investor relations.




The way we communicate is undergoing a fundamental change. This also applies to our clients, who find themselves confronted with entirely new stakeholder groups. In our Stakeholder Intelligence & Engagement Team, we assist our clients in understanding their stakeholders through quantitative and qualitative data analysis and in reaching them with tailored strategies across all communicative touchpoints, convincing them of our clients' objectives.




Join our Berlin team as (Junior) Full Stack Data Scientist.




What tasks can you look forward to?




Processing, cleaning, transforming and analyzing vast amounts of complex data, be it with standard, locally-trained AI models and ML algorithms, cutting-edge LLMs and other APIs, or other data mining procedures.




Conveying the results of such analyses to audiences with different backgrounds: from business and communication experts, to data scientists, statisticians, and mathematicians, in the form of formal non-technical presentations, rigorous written reports, or informal conversations.




Complement the standard data science skillset by being actively involved in the deployment, maintenance, and productization of your data science pipelines. This component is essential to this position and would take ~20% of your workload.







What should you bring along?




You are a motivated data scientist that is passionate about both data quality and code quality, graduated in an area that relies heavily on data and quantitative research.




You are proficient in the standard Python data science stack (e.g. numpy, scipy, sklearn, pandas) and have proven experience, or an eagerness to learn about, classical and modern NLP techniques.




You have proven experience in, or an eagerness to learn about, disciplines that complement the standard data science skillset, such as data engineering, software engineering, DevOps, MLOps, prompt engineering, QA/testing, etc.




You are open to learning new techniques, languages, tools, and theories that will enrich your knowledge base about data science and beyond.




Proven knowledge of Python is required, and will be demonstrated during the interview process. Experience in SQL, Javascript, or LookML is desirable.




You communicate fluently in written and spoken English.




You love variety and new challenges and really thrive when working in a team.







What we can offer you




Highly attractive starting salary




An inspiring working environment as well as the opportunity to work at one of our international offices for a limited period of time




Exciting tasks and attractive development prospects




Induction and individual support from an experienced colleague




Deepening of your expertise with regard to different sectors and areas of competence through close cooperation of our integrated project teams




Continuous training opportunities (FGS Global Academy)




A dedicated, supportive and growing team




A corporate culture that combines excellence with team spirit




The opportunity to work flexibly both in our offices and from home




Don’t meet every single requirement? Please don’t worry! Studies have shown that some groups like women or people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single requirement. At FGS Global, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. So, if you’re excited about this role and our company but your previous professional experience doesn’t match perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we would like to encourage you to apply anyway. You may just be the right candidate for this or another role.




We look forward to your complete application (incl. all relevant academic and professional certificates and/or reference letters). Feel free to contact our HR team at +49 69 92 18 74-28 or by email at careers-eu@fgsglobal.com.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That’s where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $20M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Senior Data Scientist in Aignostic's foundation model team you will work on our self-supervised base models. Together with collaborators in academia and industry you will push the state of the art in large-scale machine learning for digital pathology. Within our team of experts on large-scale machine learning and data handling, you will work on improving, benchmarking and extending our family of best-in-class foundations models, bridging image, text and other pathology data modalities. Moreover, using our foundation models you will contribute to developing prototypes for new applications to assist pathologists and generate new insights for improving cancer treatment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

We are embarking on Project NAFAS, a landmark 30 million EUR initiative set to revolutionize the field.

We are seeking an innovative and skilled scientist with at least 1-3 years of experience and a specific combination of skills: The ideal candidate has profound knowledge of probabilistic machine learning modelling and of the application of these methods in the realm of (adaptive) human-computer interaction.

This particular position will focus on the design and development of neuroadaptive systems, i.e., systems that can adapt to the user's cognitive and emotional states in real time, based on a number of simultaneously obtained streams of data. The data in question will include decoded brain activity, discrete event markers of incidents within the environment, and many other continuous or discrete data points providing additional contextual information stemming from a virtual or real-life setting.

We have an exciting opportunity for a data scientist to join a unique team aiming to reduce to reduce health inequalities in North East London within the next 3 years.

We are looking for a talented and collaborative colleague, who wants to make a difference. The postholder will work with clinical, data and academic teams to use Natural Language Processing techniques on free-text combined with Electronic Health Record datasets to build a predictive geographical map of heart disease in North East London, allowing better targeting and delivery of diagnostic testing.

The Barts Health PREDICT project aims to leverage real-world patient data to extract clinical and social determinants of cardiovascular health, and then identify at-risk social and geographic groups who will have enhanced access to echocardiography, a clinical test that can detect heart disease years before it becomes dangerous.

To excel in this role, you will be capable of independent and team-oriented work, have some academic experience, have skills in building reproducible data pipelines and in real-world data analysis, including machine learning techniques.

If you are interested in applying and would like further information about this role or wish to have an informal discussion, please contact Dr. Sophie Williams via email at, sophielouise.williams@nhs.net

Barts Health is one of the largest NHS trusts in the country, and one of Britain’s leading healthcare providers.

The Barts Health group of NHS hospitals is entering an exciting new era on our improvement journey to becoming an outstanding organisation with a world-class clinical reputation. Having lifted ourselves out of special measures, we now have the impetus and breathing space to chart a fresh course in which we are continually striving to improve all our services for patients.

Our vision is to be a high-performing group of NHS hospitals, renowned for excellence and innovation, and providing safe and compassionate care to our patients in east London and beyond. That means being a provider of excellent patient safety, known for delivering consistently high standards of harm-free care and always caring for patients in the right place at the right time. It also means being an outstanding place to work, in which our WeCare values and behaviours are visible to all and guide us in how we work together.

We strive to live by our WeCare values and are committed to promoting inclusion, where every staff member has a sense of belonging. We value our differences and fully advocate, cultivate and support an inclusive working environment.

We particularly welcome applications from Black, Asian and minority ethnic candidates as they are underrepresented within Barts Health at this band.

We're the world's first luxury beauty and wellness buyers' club. And we're disrupting the beauty industry, one face cream at a time.

Before we arrived on the scene, if you wanted really great beauty products, you had to shop at traditional beauty retail - and overpay for all the crazy markups. Now, our members have access to shop from the best-quality beauty and wellness products (from the leading labs in France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Japan, Korea, etc) and get a bigger piece of the Beauty Pie.

Beauty Pie is looking for a Senior Data Scientist to join and lead our company-wide efforts in experimentation. We're a fast growing ecommerce and membership company with numerous opportunities to test and develop our offering on a highly engaged customer base.

We believe it's all about mindset, great skills, the right attitude and a fantastic work ethic. If you're aligned to our values, excited about the opportunity, and you're really good at what you do (even if you don't tick all the boxes) apply anyway!


Hands-On experience devising and leading a comprehensive experimentation strategy in a consumer-facing organisation with in-depth knowledge of experimentation best practice, particularly in product and marketing settings.
Strong statistical modelling skills, acting as a go-to person for experimentation analysis and development.
Familiarity with best in class experimentation tooling and processes, having implemented them successfully across a wide-range of stakeholders.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills with a demonstrated ability to articulate a vision for experimentation.


Additional


Outstanding academic background in statistics or relevant discipline.
Extensive experience in commercial settings as a data scientist or analyst, developing rigorous solutions to impactful problems.
Strong python and SQL skills with an understanding of data pipelines, analytics engineering and modelling.
Acute bias for action, comfortable leading in ambiguous environments.


What makes someone 'Beauty Pie'?

Our culture is our DNA. It defines who we are, how we operate and how we hire. And it all springs from our values, which are very important to us:


Bring Your 'A' Game: Take ownership & accountability. Make sh*t happen. Grow. Support. Evolve. Invent. Be open-minded.
Be Intelligently Rebellious: Challenge the status quo. Push boundaries. Embrace change. Think BIG.
Be Customer Obsessed: Listen & learn. Take ownership. Act fast. Be humble & empathetic. Build & keep trust. Be grateful for feedback.
It's All For One (& One For All): Take advantage of collective intelligence. Act with integrity. Support & challenge. Embrace individuality. Do right by our company, our members, our colleagues & our environment.


We're committed to diversity & inclusion

As a business that's based on fairness and self-worth, our commitment to inclusivity runs through the heart of everything we do. We believe that innovation and creativity come from having a diverse workforce, and are committed to building teams with unique identities, from different backgrounds and with individual perspectives.

We've got a long way to go, but here's how we're doing as of June 2024:

Employees who identify as female: 68%

Employees from minority ethnic backgrounds: 28%

Employees who identify as living with a disability: 10%

Employees who identify as female in our Product Engineering teams: 32%

Employees who identify as LGBTQIA+: 13%

A bit about our ways of working

We foster a high-performance culture, where you are trusted to get the work done. We treat all of our teams like adults in giving them autonomy and flexibility.

Every Cure is a start-up, nonprofit drug development organization on a mission to alleviate suffering for the ~300 million people worldwide battling diseases without FDA-approved treatments by unlocking hidden cures. We are building a first-of-its-kind, AI-powered platform to identify FDA-approved treatments that can be repurposed for untreated diseases. Inspired by our success in repurposing over a dozen drugs for new uses, including one that is saving Dr. David Fajgenbaum's own life, we are committed to unlocking the full potential of FDA-approved drugs to treat every disease and patient possible.

Our groundbreaking approach revolves around building an open-source database and employing cutting-edge tools to identify drug repurposing opportunities. Since launching at the 2022 Clinton Global Initiative, we have received tremendous media attention and recognition including the 2023 Elevate Prize Foundation Founder’s Award, attracted leaders from across industries, been invited to share about our work at the White House, Aspen Ideas, and a Congressional Caucus Briefing, and demonstrated the life-saving potential of our platform.

Four Strategic Pillars Guide Our Efforts


Using an AI engine to identify promising drug repurposing opportunities.
Prioritizing high-impact opportunities which affect neglected patient communities.
Efficiently validating promising opportunities through laboratory and clinical studies.
Ensuring everyone has equitable access to new cures.


As a nonprofit organization, we are able to focus on maximizing patient impact and saving lives without needing to consider the commercial viability of drugs, including the 80% that are already generic and completely neglected. Our team, comprising experts in drug discovery, data analysis, and clinical trials, collaborates with entities ranging from philanthropic organizations to biopharmaceutical industries including Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Flagship Pioneering, Clinton Global Initiative, Elevate Prize Foundation, and Lyda Hill Philanthropies, among others.

The Every Cure team is expanding rapidly and seeking top-notch, purpose-driven professionals to perform a range of tasks to save lives with hidden cures. This is a unique opportunity to join a highly motivated, patient-focused team based in Philadelphia, PA and New York City that works closely with international collaborators, government agencies, academic researchers, philanthropic organizations, and biopharmaceutical companies to make a significant impact on patients with major unmet medical needs.

About The Role

At Tesco, our Data Science team focuses on modelling complex business problems and deploying data products at scale. Our work spans across multiple areas including physical stores, online, supply chain, marketing and Clubcard, where we encourage rotation amongst our Data Scientists so they can gain expertise in different subjects.

We work on several domains and problem types: online, pricing, security, fulfilment, distribution, property, IoT and computer vision are just some. Our team members spend 10% of their week on learning and personal development. Multiple academic collaborations enrich the team expertise; knowledge sharing events are regular. Furthermore, we have a great work-life balance, team days and relaxed but engaging culture.

As a Data Scientist, you will need to understand difficult business problems and prototype solutions with minimal support. Apply, modify and design algorithms and mathematical models to solve business problems on top of big data architectures (Hadoop, Spark) is a core component of the role. Our data scientists will need to be able to validate, document and present the modeling process and performances, as well as communicate complex solutions in a clear, understandable way to non-experts. Data Scientists are also responsible for promoting data science across Tesco and promote Tesco across the external Data Science community.

You will need

We are looking for ambitious individuals with a mix of statistics, programming, and machine learning skills. The role requires that you have an extensive background in machine learning and data mining. A track record in modifying and designing advanced algorithms and applying them to large data sets is essential.

An ideal candidate will have a scientific mentality with the ability to ask the right questions, as well as answer them. A strong numerical higher degree in a mathematical, scientific, engineering or computer science discipline is preferable, as well as a solid understanding of mathematics and statistical principles.

Experience in one or more of the following fields is required: predictive modelling, operational research, deep learning, and time series modelling. Finally, strong programming experience (Python is preferred).

Contribute to building and interpreting Marketing Mix Models (MMM) to understand the best growth activities.
Collaborate with Data Analysts to ensure they effectively utilise the models you build.



Requirements



We're open-minded when it comes to hiring and we care more about aptitude and attitude than specific experience or qualifications. We think the ideal candidate will encompass most of the following:

Solid understanding of customer lifetime value (LTV) modelling and marketing mix modelling.
Deep understanding of statistics, especially Bayesian reasoning, and the ability to assess the accuracy of your results.
Experience with causal inference concepts and machine learning models for causal inference.
Comfortable with a variety of modelling techniques, including gradient boosting, neural networks, linear regression, and blending these approaches.
Expert in Python with the ability to make well-reasoned design decisions in your code.
Comfortable working with external data sources through APIs.
Ability to see the bigger picture of business processes and clearly define how models can be integrated and add value.
Excellent communication and visualisation skills to effectively present your findings to different audiences.

Interview Process

Interviewing is a two way process and we want you to have the time and opportunity to get to know us, as much as we are getting to know you! Our interviews are conversational and we want to get the best from you, so come with questions and be curious. In general you can expect the below, following a chat with one of our Talent Team:

Stage 1 - 45 mins with one of the team
Stage 2 - Take home test
Stage 3 - 60 mins technical interview with two team members
Stage 4 - 45 min final with an executive and a member of the people team

Adeptmind - Machine Learning Engineer

Our platform helps online retailers bridge the gap between online and offline conversion rates. A bad search means a bad customer experience. Our technology uses deep learning and natural language processing to eliminate the “no results found” problem and show your customers what they want when they want it. Our results speak for themselves. No fancy jargon, just 100% accuracy every time.

We believe search should be intuitive and intelligent, rather than a barrier for online stores and customers. We have the tools. Let’s make it happen.

Position

As a Machine Learning Engineer, you will be responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining machine learning models and algorithms that drive key business decisions and enhance our products and services.

Responsibilities:


Develop and implement machine learning models and algorithms to solve complex business problems.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.
