Together with our members, we’re changing the way people think about and interact with personal finance.

We’re a next-generation financial services company and national bank using innovative, mobile-first technology to help our millions of members reach their goals. The industry is going through an unprecedented transformation, and we’re at the forefront. We’re proud to come to work every day knowing that what we do has a direct impact on people’s lives, with our core values guiding us every step of the way. Join us to invest in yourself, your career, and the financial world.

The Role

We are seeking a full stack Senior Data Scientist who will help shape business strategy and product development decisions through data-driven insights.

The goal of this platform is to provide new ways for our partners to help their employees get their money right across every life stage.

Success in this role hinges on your technical aptitude, quantitative abilities, and business acumen: you know how to plow through data with SQL/Python/R/Tableau, surface insights using math/statistics/ML techniques, and measure the business impact using efficiency/conversion/profit metrics. You treat stakeholders as a partnership – you are there at each step of the way and you know that we only succeed if we succeed together.

This role

What you’ll do:

Own end-to-end product analytics workflow including formulating success metrics, socializing them across the organization, and creating dashboards/reports.
Act as a curator of data by defining, instrumenting, and tracking necessary analytics of our products by working cross functionally with engineering and product teams.
Build self-service systems to enable others in the organization to leverage your work.
Analyze and perform statistical analysis on data that underlies product experiments.
Build models to help decision makers understand customer behaviors and segmentation
You stay focused on what’s best for the company – sometimes that requires being flexible, other times it requires being steadfast.



What you’ll need:



Bachelor’s degree required (Masters preferred) in Computer Science, Math, Physics, Engineering or quantitative field.
4+ years of relevant work experience
Intellectual curiosity and aptitude to pick up new technical skills
Exceptional problem-solving skills
Ability to initiate and drive projects to completion with minimal guidance

We're on a mission to transform spoken communication for individuals, teams and organizations of any size. Meetings may be our most information-rich channel for work, but suffer from a lack of structure and documentation. At Supernormal, we're solving this problem with focus, design and craft.

We've been working on this since 2019 and have customers like Snap, Salesforce, Replay, Gitcoin, Pinterest and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we are growing rapidly and are excited for new teammates to join who are the best at what they do. We're passionately building a team that is as diverse and creative as the millions of people we serve worldwide.

Supernormal is a remote-first company and does not require co-location. We have annual team retreats and gather quarterly.

About The Role

Machine learning engineers at Supernormal build the AI that superpowers the core product experience for people's meetings including transcription, note generation, and task automation. The AI team builds reliable and secure services that use the most advanced AI models in the market to generate millions of high-quality meeting notes to a rapidly growing customer base. Our work revolves heavily around software engineering, too - we are looking for people with a drive to roll up their sleeves and get new models and features out to users as quickly as possible.

What You'll Work On

As an ML engineer on Supernormal's AI team, you will be responsible for the end-to-end development of our AI solutions for meeting notes, question answering, and task completion. Your work will encompass LLM API calls, custom model training and deployment, speech recognition, quality evaluation and fixes, retrieval augmented generation, and much more. You'll play a key role in optimizing for cost, latency, and quality. Some of the projects you'll work on include:


Prompt engineering using state-of-the-art techniques to improve the core meeting assistant scenarios
Building and shipping custom machine learning models to augment the AI stack, including improving transcript quality, reducing tokens sent to APIs, removing defects in LLM output, and extracting semi-structured data
Training and deploying custom large language models from open source using state-of-the-art techniques (LoRA, RLHF, instruction-tuning, etc)
Developing new product experiences using NLP & LLMs that get better based on user feedback & iteration while collaborating with product engineers & design team
Defining and improving business & product metrics to optimize the quality and cost of AI usage
Improving LLM-powered search and question answering (using RAG) over sets of meetings
Advocating for, and building, new and better ways of doing things. You'll leave everything you touch just a bit better than you found it



Requirements

What you will bring

We are a fast-moving startup building zero-to-one products on top of large language models. The ideal candidate has a strong machine learning background and a hacker mindset, someone who can both spin up Jupyter Notebooks to train models and also excel at writing solid, fast production code for deployment.

Today, we are growing rapidly and are excited for new teammates to join who are the best at what they do. We're passionately building a team that is as diverse and creative as the millions of people we serve worldwide.<br><br>Supernormal is a remote-first company and does not require co-location. We have annual team retreats and gather quarterly.<br><br><strong>About The Role<br><br></strong>Machine learning engineers at Supernormal build the AI that superpowers the core product experience for people's meetings including transcription, note generation, and task automation. The AI team builds reliable and secure services that use the most advanced AI models in the market to generate millions of high-quality meeting notes to a rapidly growing customer base. Our work revolves heavily around software engineering, too - we are looking for people with a drive to roll up their sleeves and get new models and features out to users as quickly as possible.<br><br><strong>What You'll Work On<br><br></strong>As an ML engineer on Supernormal's AI team, you will be responsible for the end-to-end development of our AI solutions for meeting notes, question answering, and task completion. Your work will encompass LLM API calls, custom model training and deployment, speech recognition, quality evaluation and fixes, retrieval augmented generation, and much more. You'll play a key role in optimizing for cost, latency, and quality. Some of the projects you'll work on include:<br><br><ul><li> Prompt engineering using state-of-the-art techniques to improve the core meeting assistant scenarios</li><li> Building and shipping custom machine learning models to augment the AI stack, including improving transcript quality, reducing tokens sent to APIs, removing defects in LLM output, and extracting semi-structured data</li><li> Training and deploying custom large language models from open source using state-of-the-art techniques (LoRA, RLHF, instruction-tuning, etc)</li><li> Developing new product experiences using NLP &amp; LLMs that get better based on user feedback &amp; iteration while collaborating with product engineers &amp; design team</li><li> Defining and improving business &amp; product metrics to optimize the quality and cost of AI usage</li><li> Improving LLM-powered search and question answering (using RAG) over sets of meetings</li><li> Advocating for, and building, new and better ways of doing things.

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, and India.


Please only apply to one opening. If you are a better fit for another opening, our team will move your application. Candidates who apply to multiple openings will not be considered.**

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe’s mission is to build the economic infrastructure for the internet. Risk Engineering brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s financial and regulatory risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. We build ML and backend systems to catch fraudsters, understand users’ cash flow and financial health, and ensure Stripe’s users are compliant with regulatory and financial partner requirements. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from financial losses that can put Stripe’s business at risk.

The Risk group consists of machine learning, backend, and full stack engineers who tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We are undertaking several new efforts, where you can have an outsized impact on the architecture, implementation, and design choices behind these systems.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching models
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly reduce Stripe’s financial losses
Building systems that evaluate businesses for risk and take appropriate actions
Working with our partner teams to launch new policies that directly impact Stripe’s bottom line
Helping engineers across the company to develop technologies for scaling our infrastructure
Debugging production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 2 years of industry experience in training ML models
Enjoy and have experience shipping ML models in a large-scale production environment
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


Have experience in Python, Scala (Spark), or Ruby



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We're on a mission to transform spoken communication for individuals, teams and organizations of any size. Meetings may be our most information-rich channel for work, but suffer from a lack of structure and documentation. At Supernormal, we're solving this problem with focus, design and craft.

We've been working on this since 2019 and have customers like Snap, Salesforce, Replay, Gitcoin, Pinterest and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we are growing rapidly and are excited for new teammates to join who are the best at what they do. We're passionately building a team that is as diverse and creative as the millions of people we serve worldwide.

Supernormal is a remote-first company and does not require co-location. We have annual team retreats and gather quarterly.

About The Role

Machine learning engineers at Supernormal build the AI that superpowers the core product experience for people's meetings including transcription, note generation, and task automation. The AI team builds reliable and secure services that use the most advanced AI models in the market to generate millions of high-quality meeting notes to a rapidly growing customer base. Our work revolves heavily around software engineering, too - we are looking for people with a drive to roll up their sleeves and get new models and features out to users as quickly as possible.

What You'll Work On

As an ML engineer with a focus on modeling at Supernormal, you will specialize in developing and refining models that power our AI solutions for meeting notes, question answering, and task completion. Your expertise will be critical in LLM API calls, custom model training and deployment, speech recognition, quality evaluation and fixes, and retrieval augmented generation. You will primarily focus on optimizing model performance, cost, latency, and quality. Some of the projects you'll work on include:


Prompt engineering using state-of-the-art techniques to improve the core meeting assistant scenarios
Building and shipping custom machine learning models to augment the AI stack, including improving transcript quality, reducing tokens sent to APIs, removing defects in LLM output, and extracting semi-structured data
Training and deploying custom large language models from open source using state-of-the-art techniques (LoRA, RLHF, instruction-tuning, etc)
Specializing in model optimization to enhance performance and efficiency
Developing new product experiences using NLP & LLMs that get better based on user feedback & iteration while collaborating with product engineers & design team
Defining and improving business & product metrics to optimize the quality and cost of AI usage
Improving LLM-powered search and question answering (using RAG) over sets of meetings
Advocating for, and building, new and better ways of doing things. You'll leave everything you touch just a bit better than you found it



Requirements

What you will bring

We are a fast-moving startup building zero-to-one products on top of large language models. The ideal candidate is passionate about machine learning modeling, with a foundational understanding of algorithms and hands-on experience in developing and optimizing models. You exhibit proficiency in basic data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation, with a willingness to learn and grow in the field.


AI/ML Experience: 2-3 years of demonstrated experience working on real-world machine learning projects. This includes proficiency in developing and optimizing machine learning models, along with skills in model evaluation, validation, and tuning. Familiarity with handling large datasets, data preprocessing, and feature engineering is essential. Experience in deploying models into production environments and monitoring their performance is highly desirable
A Solid Educational Foundation: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, AI, Mathematics, or related field; Master's degree or PhD in related disciplines is a plus
Software Engineering Skills: Proficiency in software development principles and best practices, such as version control, code review, and testing. Experience with collaborative development tools and platforms, such as GitHub, is essential. Familiarity with Agile methodologies and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines is highly desirable
Proficient in Python and SQL: our AI stack uses Python & PyTorch and interfaces with Ruby on Rails (bonus if you know it, but not required) and we write a lot of SQL queries on top of Snowflake to pull data


What we'll expect of you


A collaborative and open outlook — we're all about lifting each other up and getting better every day
A willingness to get deep into a problem even when it seems impossible. You'll always have support from the team
Confidence operating with high agency. We'll work together to decide what's important, but we'd love for you to bring (and build!) your own ideas
You'll come in willing to learn why things are the way they are, then suggest a better way
You'll understand that there's no difference between ""my idea"" and ""their idea."" It's our ideas and we're all responsible for it
You'll approach speed bumps and reviews through a ""how can the team level up?"" lens — let's all get better and learn, together


What you can expect from us


We're a fully distributed team spread between Pacific Time (Seattle) and Central European Time (Stockholm) with lots of places in between. We'll see you most days in Slack, Google Meet, GitHub issues, and Notion. Sometimes in person in a place with a warm breeze
We're a friendly bunch and are happy to pair, talk through, or otherwise assist any time
Honest and timely feedback. We're all better when we can have candid conversations about what is and isn't working
A willingness to listen to your ideas: how can the codebase, our product, or team be better?
A respect for your time outside of work. We all work hard here, but we never forget to rest and have fun

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Come take off with us!

The yearly total compensation for this senior position ranges from 110 000$ to 300 000$ USD. Compensation will be determined by candidates' relevant qualifications, knowledge, skills and work experience.

Nextdoor is where you connect to the neighborhoods that matter to you so you can belong. Our purpose is to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.

Neighbors around the world turn to Nextdoor daily to receive trusted information, give and get help, get things done, and build real-world connections with those nearby — neighbors, businesses, and public services. Today, neighbors rely on Nextdoor in more than 315,000 neighborhoods across 11 countries.

Meet Your Future Neighbors

Product finance, strategy and operations (“Product FSO”) is committed to driving growth through new user acquisition and increasing engagement amongst our existing user base of neighbors. Today, we work closely with product and engineering teams to understand the impact and trends across growth and engagement while building and maintaining our quarterly and long-range forecasts. Historically, we’ve been strong in our reporting and forecasting; however, have lacked the bandwidth and capabilities to dive deeper into our data to better understand “why” we’re seeing what we’re seeing to subsequently get to “what” we should be doing about it.

We are looking for an entrepreneurial and driven Senior Operations Data Scientist to establish the foundation of our data and analytics work. You will work closely with various cross-functional teams such as product, engineering, etc. to develop a BI layer and assist us in better understanding key metrics through causal analyses, data tooling, and dashboarding. Successful candidates will exhibit technical acumen, product sense and business savvy. You are passionate about leveraging the power of data to drive product changes with quality and agility. You are a team player.

At Nextdoor, we offer a warm and inclusive work environment that embraces a hybrid employment experience, providing a flexible experience for our valued employees.

The Impact You’ll Make

Role

The work of Product FSO is essential to the growth and success of the company and involves frequent opportunities to showcase key metrics and findings to senior leadership. In this role, you will:


Partner closely with Finance and ProdDev leads to identifying strategic, high-impact analytical problems and innovative ways to solve them with data
Insight discovery: Deliver data insights and drive for adoption through tools (e.g. dashboards, self-serve reporting), memos and presentations. Additionally, analyze data to identify trends, discrepancies, and opportunities for improvement. Provide actionable recommendations and insights to senior management to facilitate informed decision-making
Analytics support: Conduct statistical analyses and modeling, exploratory/causal analysis, and metric development to uncover data insights that in turn better inform key decisions
Performance management support: Assist in our weekly performance tracking and management of business operations. Ensure accuracy and timeliness in performance reporting, helping the team meet its short and long-term objectives
Analytics foundation: Partner with our Analytics Engineering team to create and maintain a solid data foundation using advanced data analysis tools and techniques. Extract and manipulate large datasets to create meaningful metrics and insights that inform strategic decisions
Collaboration: Facilitate data ownership and accountability by closely partnering with data science, product, and engineering partners to improve data robustness
Participate in in-person Nextdoor events, trainings, off-sites, volunteer days, and other team building exercises
Build in-person relationships with team members and contribute to the KIND culture that Nextdoor values


What You’ll Bring To The Team


Advanced degree in a quantitative field and 6 - 8+ years working in data science, product analytics, or business intelligence, or equivalent (starting level is flexible)
Strategic-minded, impact-driven, and capable of incorporating larger business context into data questions and product development
Experience architecting, debugging, and executing SQL queries
Excellent knowledge of Looker (preferred) or another BI/visualization tool
Comfortable knowledge of Python or R, including common scientific computing packages and data science tools such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn
Comfort with methods, tools, and packages for statistical modeling and machine learning
Experience formulating, running, and sharing complex analyses, including different types of experiments, cohort retention studies, and other exploratory analysis work
Intermediate knowledge of at least one big data technology such as Hive, Presto, or Spark
Excellent written and oral communication, including ability to effectively communicate complexity to a diverse group of stakeholders
Curiosity about how things work, from both a business and technical perspective
A self-starter who thrives under a high level of ambiguity and autonomy


It’s ok if you don’t have all of these requirements; if you think you’d be a good fit for the role, please get in touch with us!

Bonus Points


Past experience in solving problems in Finance or other business-facing areas
Work experience related to social or community-based products
Work experience related to small businesses and marketplaces
Work experience related to advertising and auction systems
Expertise deploying models to production
Expertise in testing and evaluating the impact of network effects
Knowledge of web applications and service-oriented architecture


Rewards

Compensation, benefits, perks, and recognition programs at Nextdoor come together to create one overall rewards package.

The starting salary for this role is expected to range from $175,000 to $210,000 on an annualized basis, or potentially greater in the event that your 'level' of proficiency exceeds the level expected for the role.

We also expect to award a meaningful equity grant for this role. With equal quarterly vesting, your first vest date would be within the first 3 months of your start date.

Overall, total compensation will vary depending on your relevant skills, experience, and qualifications. We have you covered! Nextdoor employees can choose between a variety of great health plans. We cover 100% of your personal monthly premium for health, dental, and vision – and provide a OneMedical membership for concierge care.

At Nextdoor, we empower our employees to build stronger local communities.

We are helping our early stage (Pre-Seed -> Series B) portfolio companies grow their teams.

A portfolio company is looking to hire machine learning engineers as their sales increase and they confirm product-market fit.

While being good at what you do are table stakes, we believe the following will make you successful in a startup:


Optimistic individuals are persistent, determined, and unwilling to give up in the face of adversity. They keep working towards a goal or objective despite setbacks or failures. Optimism often involves a combination of perseverance, resilience, and determination.
Growth-oriented individuals embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a key to success. They are willing to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. Growth-oriented individuals are curious, see learning as a lifelong process, and embrace feedback. They are willing to try new things, and are not afraid to change direction if something isn’t working.
Effective individuals collaborate well, work consistently and purposefully towards achieving their goals, efficiently manage their time, and are self-motivated. They are able to identify problems, analyze them critically, and develop effective solutions.


Please note that many early stage startups are unable to sponsor visas of any kinds (ie, no transfers, no sponsoring of student visas, or no sponsoring of new visas).

Familiarity with hydrological and oceanographic modeling techniques and programs, such as ROMS, cGENIE, Geochemist’s Workbench, PHREEQC, SUMO.
Strong understanding of the carbon cycle, geochemical kinetics, and oceanography.
Experience with machine learning techniques and leveraging large datasets for predictive modeling.
Strong communication and teamwork skills.
Ability to thrive in a fast-paced, rapidly changing startup environment where priorities can shift on a monthly basis.
You practice extreme ownership (no task is too small).
You love being in the trenches with your team and working with high empathy.
You have a growth mindset.




Location




CREW has offices and labs in New Haven, CT and offices in Brooklyn, NY. The ideal candidate will be in-person, though there is an option available for remote/hybrid work as needed.




Why Work At Crew Carbon?




According to recent research, the global water and wastewater treatment market size was valued at $323+ billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $617+ billion by 2032; North America dominated the water and wastewater treatment market with a market share of 38.67% in 2023.
According to McKinsey & Company, the carbon removal (CDR) market could become a trillion-dollar industry, potentially reaching up to $1.2 trillion by 2050, highlighting the significant economic opportunities within this emerging sector.
We utilize the extensive infrastructure present in wastewater treatment systems to provide robust, empirical, and durable carbon dioxide removal through enhanced weathering, while delivering process benefits to our partners; our process was patented while at Yale University, with patents granted by the US Patent Office and global filings already in place.
We have assembled a team of experts in climate and wastewater, and we are supported by expert partners (Pacific Northwest National Labs, Department of Energy, Carbon to Sea Initiative, Yale University)
We have completed a successful pilot and have built many thousands of tons of CDR capacity, with several new deployments coming online in Q32024




Highlights




CREW has won a large carbon credit contract with the premier buyer of carbon credits, the Frontier Climate Fund in Winter 2022
CREW was selected as 1 of 24 companies by the US Department of Energy in 2024 to be a potential supplier of high-quality carbon credits to the federal government, who could be one of CREW's largest carbon credit buyers.
CREW was highlighted as an “Innovation of the Month” by United States Senator, Chris Murphy.
CREW was selected by ImagineH2O, the leading water sector innovation accelerator.
CREW was highlighted by Business Insider as “One of the Most Promising Climate-Tech Startups of 2023.”
