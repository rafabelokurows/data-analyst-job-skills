Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is a global management consulting firm and the world’s leading advisor on business strategy. We partner with clients from the private, public, and not-for-profit sectors in all regions to identify their highest-value opportunities, address their most critical challenges, and transform their enterprises. Our customized approach combines deep insight into the dynamics of companies and markets with close collaboration at all levels of the client organization. This ensures that our clients achieve sustainable competitive advantage, build more capable organizations, and secure lasting results. Founded in 1963, BCG is a private company with offices in more than 90 cities in 50 countries. For more information, please visit bcg.com.

BCG’s clients are the world’s top business leaders. From computers to retailing, our professional expertise spans over 50 industries. The vast majority of our clients rank among the 500 largest companies in each of our three major regions–Americas (North and South), Europe Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Additionally, we work with a number of small- to medium-sized companies, both public and private.

The success of our assignments routinely leads our clients to maintain long-term relationships with us. Over 85 percent of our revenues come from clients who continue to work with us from one year to the next to maintain the momentum for change and to continually improve bottom-line results they have achieved with our help.

We pride ourselves on our fresh thinking. Our evolving ideas profoundly change the way most businesses think about competition. Many leading business concepts over the past three decades originated with BCG–including, experience curve, time-based competition, Segment-of-One® marketing, deconstruction, and trading up. Our recent Collateral Damage publication series has addressed the implications for managers of the on-going financial crisis.

We believe that no other consulting organization has concentrated as thoroughly on understanding business competition and helping companies make the changes necessary to succeed in increasingly competitive markets.

Nos récentes publications de la série Collateral Damage ont traité de l'implication des dirigeants face à la crise financière en cours.

Nous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is a global management consulting firm and the world’s leading advisor on business strategy. We partner with clients from the private, public, and not-for-profit sectors in all regions to identify their highest-value opportunities, address their most critical challenges, and transform their enterprises. Our customized approach combines deep insight into the dynamics of companies and markets with close collaboration at all levels of the client organization. This ensures that our clients achieve sustainable competitive advantage, build more capable organizations, and secure lasting results. Founded in 1963, BCG is a private company with offices in more than 90 cities in 50 countries. For more information, please visit bcg.com.

BCG’s clients are the world’s top business leaders. From computers to retailing, our professional expertise spans over 50 industries. The vast majority of our clients rank among the 500 largest companies in each of our three major regions–Americas (North and South), Europe Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Additionally, we work with a number of small- to medium-sized companies, both public and private.

The success of our assignments routinely leads our clients to maintain long-term relationships with us. Over 85 percent of our revenues come from clients who continue to work with us from one year to the next to maintain the momentum for change and to continually improve bottom-line results they have achieved with our help.

We pride ourselves on our fresh thinking. Our evolving ideas profoundly change the way most businesses think about competition. Many leading business concepts over the past three decades originated with BCG–including, experience curve, time-based competition, Segment-of-One® marketing, deconstruction, and trading up. Our recent Collateral Damage publication series has addressed the implications for managers of the on-going financial crisis.

We believe that no other consulting organization has concentrated as thoroughly on understanding business competition and helping companies make the changes necessary to succeed in increasingly competitive markets.

La réputation mondiale du cabinet de conseil en gestion Boston Consulting Group (BCG), comme l'un des meilleurs en gestion, découle de plus de cinquante années d'expérience à aider les cadres supérieurs à découvrir et réaliser tout le potentiel de leur entreprise. Notre mission consiste à appuyer nos clients à réaliser des avantages concurrentiels durables en offrant des solutions personnalisées. Nous croyons fermement qu'il faut travailler avec nos clients, pas à leurs dépens. Nous collaborons avec chaque client pour l'aider à prendre une direction et à faire face aux défis organisationnels et opérationnels.

Fondé en 1963, BCG compte maintenant plus de 11,000 experts-conseils, et ce, dans plus de 90 bureaux dans le monde entier. Les clients du BCG sont les dirigeants des plus importantes entreprises du monde. Des ordinateurs jusqu'à la vente au détail, notre expertise professionnelle s'étend à plus de 50 industries. La grande majorité de nos clients figurent parmi les 500 plus grandes entreprises dans chacune de nos trois régions principales – Les Amériques (nord et sud), l'Europe (incluant le Moyen-Orient et l'Afrique) et l'Asie-Pacifique. De plus, nous travaillons avec un certain nombre de petites et moyennes entreprises, tant publiques que privées.

Notre succès, provenant des mandats qui nous sont assignés, nous permet d'établir des relations à long terme avec nos clients. Plus de 85 pourcents de nos revenus proviennent de clients qui continuent à travailler avec nous d'une année à l'autre pour conserver l'élan de changement et pour améliorer continuellement les résultats nets qu'ils ont réalisés grâce à notre aide.

Nous sommes fiers de notre approche innovatrice. Nos idées évolutives changent profondément la manière dont la plupart des entreprises considèrent la concurrence. Plusieurs des principaux concepts d'affaires, au cours des trois dernières décennies, ont commencé avec BCG, y compris la courbe d'apprentissage, la concurrence calculée sur le temps, le marketing Segment-of-One®, le démantèlement et l'extension ascendante. Nos récentes publications de la série Collateral Damage ont traité de l'implication des dirigeants face à la crise financière en cours.

Nous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Machine Learning Infrastructure group at Stripe aims to provide state of the art infrastructure and support for building and operationalizing AI/ML models for all business verticals within the company, including but not limited to models that mitigate risks across Stripe’s products and services globally, and models that help our customers to fight fraud by leveraging Stripe’s user facing products like Radar and Identity. ML is a top priority for Stripe in the coming years. With the phenomenal developments happening in the field of AI, we are positioned to accelerate the adoption of AI/ML across all parts of the company by building highly scalable and reliable foundational infrastructure.

What you’ll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching machine learning models using tools such as XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch.
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly impact Stripe’s top line metrics.
Propose new feature ideas and design data pipelines to incorporate them into our models
Improve the way we evaluate and monitor our model and system performance
Collaborate with stakeholders and drive end-to-end projects involving a variety of technologies and systems to successful completion.



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


At least 5 years of industry experience doing end-to-end ML development on a machine learning team and bringing ML models to production
Advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. computer science, statistics, physics, …)
Proficient in Python, Scala, Spark



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Hands-on applied ML (model training, deployment to production, etc) experience
You keep up-to-date on the latest in AI engineering practices and research
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data
Knowledge about how to manipulate data to perform analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to evaluate a hypothesis.
Experience evaluating niche and upcoming ML solutions



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

It does not matter which programming language is your primary and we accept engineers with Python (however, you must be willing to work using Swift). Previous Swift experience is not required.

Accepted Locations

We are accepting applicants from the US, Canada, and most countries in LATAM and Europe. We are accepting some countries in Africa and Asia. For the full list of accepted locations, click here. This work is 100% remote.

Loom Video

Our Founder/CEO, Gabe Greenberg, created a more in depth Loom video that we highly recommend you watch! Check it out here: https://www.loom.com/share/5a8972c7fbbf46aaa3f389b2b6391c40

Job Overview

We are currently seeking Developers for project-specific roles focused on RLHF. This role will play a key part in our reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) initiatives, contributing to cutting-edge projects.

You’ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for for the worlds most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the biggest players in the AI/LLM space today. We are seeking software engineers with 4+ years of experience to train AI large language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!

What Will I Be Doing?


Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""which piece of Python code is better?"" to ""make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterwards to make it faster""


Contract Length


This project is expected to last until the end of September and you'll be able to continue to work on other projects (though likely not in Swift).
You can end the contract at any time.


Flexible Schedules


Developers can set their own hours - ideal candidates will be interested in spending 15+ hours a week. They will be with teams, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but incredibly flexible on working hours.
Take a 3 hour lunch, no problem. You are paid according to time spent on the platform, which is calculated in the coding exercises, as opposed to tracking your own hours.


Compensation


US: $50 /hr
Brazil: $28.70/hr
Egypt: $22.05/hr
Phillipines: $25.55/hr
All other countries: $35/hr
Expectations are 15+ hours per week however there is no upper limit. We have engineers working 20-40 hrs per week and some that are working 40+ hours per week. You can work as much as you want to. You'll get paid on a weekly basis. You get paid per hour of work done on the platform.


Interview Process

We've created a 3.5 hour screening and onboarding process to join as a Software Engineer for AI Training Data which can be accomplished in 1 week or less. We purposely perform most of these steps asynchronously because most of the RLHF work is async and self guided. After you apply, if you look like a good fit we'll provide you access to the G2i dashboard to go through this simple screening process.

Step 1: Learn in depth about the role (35 min)

Step 2: Perform a simple RLHF code review (35 min)

Step 3: Receive platform credentials, pass ID verification (5 min), and join an optional live onboarding with our team (60 min)

Step 4: Perform a production level RLHF task (75 min) ""aka the final interview""

Join us: Based on your final interview, you'll will put you on the right difficulty RLHF project

We utilize a broad array of ML techniques, including classification, clustering, recommendation, summarization, prompt engineering, vector search, and retrieval augmented generation.

💡Klue + You?

Q: Klue who?

A: We’re Klue and from a technical perspective, Klue’s mission is to descale huge amounts of data to the human level, so people can process it and make use of it. Klue is that trusted intermediary, right now it’s proven for sales enablement, but tomorrow it’s all teams enablement.

Q: What level of experience are we looking for?

A: Right now, we are looking for experienced senior-level Machine Learning Engineers.

Q: What are we working on?

A: Services for collecting, processing and generating timely, relevant intel that is accurately linked to competitors, products, industries, and people. Our Machine Learning Engineers are primarily focused on the training, evaluation, and deployment of models to label, score, cluster, and generate insights.

Q: What technologies do we use?

A: Python, Transformers, Pytorch, Hugging Face, Spacy, Sklearn, Pinecone, Kubeflow, Vertex AI, BentoML, Aporia, JS, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, GCP, BigQuery, Docker/Kubernetes, Github, GPT.

We believe in using whatever tools make sense to get the job done and support our game-changing innovation.

Q: What skills do you bring?


A: You are an expert on the landscape of transformer models and are proficient with popular ML frameworks such as PyTorch, Hugging Face, or Scikit-Learn.
You stay up to date on recent advances with LLMs and you demonstrate astute judgment in deciding whether to train a model with a custom architecture or leverage GPT.
You ensure your experiments are reproducible, balancing swift discovery with scientific rigor.
You are proficient in designing, implementing, and deploying RESTful APIs and you have experience with (non)relational and vector databases.
You demonstrate good judgment when making architectural decisions and you understand how those decisions fit into the bigger picture.


Q: How do teams work?


Hybrid. Best of both worlds (remote & in-office)
Our main Canadian hubs are in Vancouver and Toronto, and most of our teams are located in EST and PST.
You and your team will be in office at least 2 days per week.


Q: What about total compensation & benefits?


Benefits. We currently have extended health benefits starting on your 1st day.
Time off. Take what you need. We want the team to prioritize wellness and avoid burnout. Vacation usually falls into 3 categories: recharging, life-event, & keeping a work-life balance. Just ensure the required work gets done and clear it with your team in advance. You need to take at least two weeks off every year. The average Klue team member takes 2-4 weeks of PTO per year.


⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️

Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Come take off with us!

The yearly total compensation for this senior position ranges from $150,000 to $350,000 CAD. Compensation will be determined by candidates' relevant qualifications, knowledge, skills and work experience.

Industrial Light & Magic, founded in 1975 by George Lucas, has created some of the most iconic moments in motion picture history. From Star Wars to Jurassic Park, Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers, The Avengers, theme park rides and interactive experiences, ILM continues to expand the possibilities of what visual entertainment can be.

ILM’s Research and Development (R&D) group develops the ground-breaking technology that empowers our artists to create dazzling visuals. ILM’s innovations have won 34 Scientific and Technical Academy Awards®. Today, we are 70+ visually-minded software engineers, working side-by-side with over a thousand digital artists in a fast-paced, intensely collaborative, creative film production environment, across studios in San Francisco, Vancouver, London, Sydney, and Mumbai.

Summary of the Role:

This role is considered Hybrid, which means the employee will work 2-3 days onsite at a Company designated location and occasionally from home.

We seek engineers to join our R&D team and help us develop tools and production techniques across all areas of visual effects and feature animation production:



Image processing, compositing, and rotoscoping, including depth estimation, image segmentation, generative in-painting, and plate relighting.
Simulating natural phenomena, rigid-body destruction, crowds and procedural animation.
Lighting, texturing, look-development, and layered material definition.
Modeling, rigging, and animation of bodies and faces, including soft-body dynamic simulation of cloth, hair, and flesh.
Tools, structures, and pipeline systems that define how artists assemble and manage massively complex 3D scenes, and user interfaces for authoring, validating, publishing, and tracking 3D and 2D data as it moves through a network of automated batch processes.



We welcome engineers with a passion for applying the latest machine learning technology to these challenges and more!

At ILM, a good idea is a good idea, regardless of where it comes from! Do you thrive in a creative environment? Do you enjoy sharing knowledge and learning from others? If you love art, technology, and movies, then this might be the role you’re looking for.

ILM strives to be an inclusive environment, and the R&D group in particular embraces promising individuals with a variety backgrounds and experiences.

What You’ll Do:



A little bit of everything! Develop innovative algorithms, craft artist-friendly user interfaces, optimize data management processes, and build special purpose content creation tools that handle large-scale photo-realistic visual effects production. Occasionally, you might work on shots alongside artists. You’ll have an opportunity to lead teams and projects and influence our development where appropriate.
Work with engineers across all ILM’s studios, splitting time between long-term software development projects and day-to-day artist support, consultation, and problem-solving.
Collaborate with commercial software vendors in developing and deploying the next generation of machine-learning-based tools wherever applicable.



What to Bring:



Proficiency in C++ and Python on Linux.
Knowledge of and/or eagerness to learn principles of visual effects, potentially with a specialty such as modeling, animation, lighting, rendering, image processing, etc.
Experience with Maya, Houdini, Katana, Mari or other commercial software applications is helpful, but a readiness to learn works as well.
Experience with machine learning techniques, processes, and toolsets.
Working knowledge of standard data formats: OpenEXR, OpenVDB, Alembic, USD, etc.
Enthusiasm for designing artist-friendly interfaces using GUI toolkits: Qt, PySide, QML, etc. You don’t need to be a professional UX designer, but you should have a keen sense for how creative people use technology to work together in production.
Appreciation of software development principles: object-oriented design, test-driven development, source code management, build and release processes.



Education / Experience:



BS and/or advanced degree in computer science or related field, or similar experience.
Typically 2+ years or demonstrated experience with professional software development and/or VFX production.

We build machine learning services and data pipelines to automatically extract insights about competitors from both public and internal data sources. Every day, our services process millions of data points, including news articles, press releases, webpage changes, Slack posts, emails, reviews, CRM opportunities, and user actions. We utilize a broad array of ML techniques, including classification, clustering, recommendation, summarization, prompt engineering, vector search, and retrieval augmented generation.

Q: Klue who?

A: We’re Klue and from a technical perspective, Klue’s mission is to descale huge amounts of data to the human level, so people can process it and make use of it. Klue is that trusted intermediary, right now it’s proven for sales enablement, but tomorrow it’s all teams enablement.

As part of our backend team, we are concerned with data storage and retrieval and the infrastructure to enable that. Here’s what our development team is working on and the opportunity for motivated Software Engineers to dig into, alongside us:


Big Data - lots of data
Ingesting hundreds of thousands of news articles, web pages, marketing, and sales data points per day. The challenge is indexing them for a long period of time and making them searchable and ready for different analyses.
Expanding our Rails REST API and offering public APIs to enable integrations.
Architect infrastructure for a scalable, resilient, and robust service. We are migrating from a monolith architecture to K8S-hosted microservices.
Retrieval Augmented Generation for Compete - An end-to-end system that ingests a real-time feed of compete content from various sources such as Slack, reviews, websites, news, interviews, sales calls, and documents, to generate relevant and factually accurate content


Q: What is our current tech stack?

A: Python (Flask), PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, GCP, AWS, Tensorflow, Keras, Docker, Kubernetes.

Transformers, Pytorch, Hugging Face, Spacy, Sklearn, Pinecone, Kubeflow, Vertex AI, BentoML, Temporal, JS, Github, GPT.

We believe in using whatever tools make sense to get the job done and support our game-changing innovation.

Q: Are you HYBRID FRIENDLY 🤩 ?

A: YES! Hybrid. Best of both worlds (remote & in-office)

Our main Canadian hubs are in Vancouver and Toronto, and most of our teams are located in EST and PST.

You and your team will be in office at least 2 days per week.

Q: What skills do you bring?


Expertise in Python
You stay up to date on recent advances with LLMs and are quick to experiment with the latest approaches including RAG
You own initiatives end to end: from prototyping to production

Experience using Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP
You demonstrate good judgment when making architectural decisions and you understand how those decisions fit into the bigger picture
Experience using NoSQL databases such as Elasticsearch or MongoDB is a plus


Q: What motivates our current team right now?


The type of work. Challenging, stimulating and meaningful work. New and relevant tech stack. We know engineers/developers especially want to work on hard technical and innovative problems.
The inspiration from skilled and proven leaders.
Entrepreneurial fingerprints on what will be a future billion dollar company anchored in Canada.
Culture, team, and the work environment.
High degree of autonomy and accountability.
High degrees of transparency and high quality communication.

Q: What about total compensation & benefits?


Benefits. We currently have extended health benefits starting on your 1st day.
Time off. Take what you need. We want the team to prioritize wellness and avoid burnout. Vacation usually falls into 3 categories: recharging, life-event, & keeping a work-life balance. Just ensure the required work gets done and clear it with your team in advance. You need to take at least two weeks off every year. The average Klue team member takes 2-4 weeks of PTO per year.


⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️

Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

We build machine learning services and data pipelines to automatically extract insights about competitors from both public and internal data sources. Every day, our services process millions of data points, including news articles, press releases, webpage changes, Slack posts, emails, reviews, CRM opportunities, and user actions. We utilize a broad array of ML techniques, including classification, clustering, recommendation, summarization, prompt engineering, vector search, and retrieval augmented generation.

💡Klue + You?

Q: Klue who?

A: We’re Klue and from a technical perspective, Klue’s mission is to descale huge amounts of data to the human level, so people can process it and make use of it. Klue is that trusted intermediary, right now it’s proven for sales enablement, but tomorrow it’s all teams enablement.

Q: What level of experience are we looking for?

A: Right now, we are looking for experienced senior-level Machine Learning Engineers.

Q: What are we working on?

A: Services for collecting, processing and generating timely, relevant intel that is accurately linked to competitors, products, industries, and people. Our Machine Learning Engineers are primarily focused on the training, evaluation, and deployment of models to label, score, cluster, and generate insights.

Q: What technologies do we use?

A: Python, Transformers, Pytorch, Hugging Face, Spacy, Sklearn, Pinecone, Kubeflow, Vertex AI, BentoML, Aporia, JS, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, GCP, BigQuery, Docker/Kubernetes, Github, GPT.

We believe in using whatever tools make sense to get the job done and support our game-changing innovation.

Q: What skills do you bring?


A: You are an expert on the landscape of transformer models and are proficient with popular ML frameworks such as PyTorch, Hugging Face, or Scikit-Learn.
You stay up to date on recent advances with LLMs and you demonstrate astute judgment in deciding whether to train a model with a custom architecture or leverage GPT.
You ensure your experiments are reproducible, balancing swift discovery with scientific rigor.
You are proficient in designing, implementing, and deploying RESTful APIs and you have experience with (non)relational and vector databases.
You demonstrate good judgment when making architectural decisions and you understand how those decisions fit into the bigger picture.


Q: How do teams work?


Hybrid. Best of both worlds (remote & in-office)
Our main Canadian hubs are in Vancouver and Toronto, and most of our teams are located in EST and PST.
You and your team will be in office at least 2 days per week.


Q: What about total compensation & benefits?


Benefits. We currently have extended health benefits starting on your 1st day.
Time off. Take what you need. We want the team to prioritize wellness and avoid burnout. Vacation usually falls into 3 categories: recharging, life-event, & keeping a work-life balance. Just ensure the required work gets done and clear it with your team in advance. You need to take at least two weeks off every year. The average Klue team member takes 2-4 weeks of PTO per year.


⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️

Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team.

You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work.

You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.

You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Come take off with us!

The yearly total compensation for this senior position ranges from $150,000 to $350,000 CAD. Compensation will be determined by candidates' relevant qualifications, knowledge, skills and work experience. Total compensation can include a solid base salary and will also include equity (options / RSUs), sign-on bonus and other potential incentives.

Experience using Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP
You demonstrate good judgment when making architectural decisions and you understand how those decisions fit into the bigger picture
Experience using NoSQL databases such as Elasticsearch or MongoDB is a plus


Q: What motivates our current team right now?


The type of work. Challenging, stimulating and meaningful work. New and relevant tech stack. We know engineers/developers especially want to work on hard technical and innovative problems.
The inspiration from skilled and proven leaders.
Entrepreneurial fingerprints on what will be a future billion dollar company anchored in Canada.
Culture, team, and the work environment.
High degree of autonomy and accountability.
High degrees of transparency and high quality communication.


Q: What are the people at Klue like?

Q: What about total compensation & benefits?


Benefits. We currently have extended health benefits starting on your 1st day.
Time off. Take what you need. We want the team to prioritize wellness and avoid burnout. Vacation usually falls into 3 categories: recharging, life-event, & keeping a work-life balance. Just ensure the required work gets done and clear it with your team in advance. You need to take at least two weeks off every year. The average Klue team member takes 2-4 weeks of PTO per year.


⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️

Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:
