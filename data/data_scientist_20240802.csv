You will leverage your strong collaboration skills and ability to extract valuable insights from highly complex data sets to ask the right questions and find the right answers.

Responsibilities

‚Ä¢ Raw image pre-processing, e.g., correcting uneven illumination, excluding artefacts caused by sample contamination, and normalizing signal levels between channels.

‚Ä¢ Quantitative single image analysis, e.g., object counting, area determination, and background characterization.

‚Ä¢ Signal analysis of 1D time traces. Looking at the time evolution of a single pixel, perform signal filtering, peak detection, and event classification.




The primary task is to work with a weekly influx of new experimental data, adapting to changing research questions and making the best of each dataset. In addition, we expect that about half the time can be spent on more long-term algorithm development to streamline the analysis process and increase the information learned from both past and future data.




Profile: This is a research position, and the candidate is expected to independently explore new data, develop the necessary algorithms, and answer questions posed in collaboration with our biochemists. The ability to critically evaluate the significance of results and suggest the necessary control experiments is key. - A PhD or similar research experience is highly meriting.




Our language of choice is Python, but the skills required for this position are essentially language independent. Other meriting skills include: GitLab CI/CD, Linux, Kubernetes, OpenCV, SQL, and Airflow.




Hourly rate for this role would be 800SEK, open to negotiation for exceptional candidates.

As a consultant with us, you'll enjoy a high salary, a generous benefits package, and the opportunity to work remotely. On average, our consultants increase their monthly pay by 44%. How is this possible?

The math is simple. We can pay you more because we cut costs on things that don't directly benefit you‚Äîno overpaid bosses, no expensive group conferences, and no big fancy offices.

Gravity Free Consulting @ Coody means:


Maximized compensation: Typically a +44% salary increase.

What You'll Be Doing

As a Data Scientist consultant you'll work on technically, intellectually challenging and fun assignments for companies to strengthen their teams and projects.

You‚Äôll be an integral part of the organisation and expected to contribute in the full stack of data science projects.

5+ years of experience working as a Data Scientist
Deep understanding of one or more technical areas stated below

What We Offer

Scania is on a journey with a strong purpose: to drive the shift towards a sustainable transport system. To get there, we have gathered a diverse team with talented and fun colleagues, endless development opportunities, and a good work-life balance. We work a mix of remote and in-office.

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt‚Äôs consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

About The Consumer Data Science Team

Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists (Analytics) and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering team who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience that requires a good mix of technical and stakeholder engagement skills. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics or data science role. Data Scientists at Wolt take ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we're looking for someone like you.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland and Sweden. You have the chance to decide the ways of working ‚Äî a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. üíô Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don‚Äôt learn, we won‚Äôt stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda‚Äôs greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
4+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent for product development (preferably consumer-facing).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you‚Äôll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

Does this sound highly appealing to you?

Then you might be our new Machine Learning (ML) Weather Scientist at Alipes Capital.




About the Role

Alipes began trading in the Energy sector in 2022. We use machine learning technology for reading and interpreting fundamental and market data and execute our trading strategies based on this data. Since our inception in 2008, we have continuously grown and diversified into new business areas driven by our technology. Alipes aims to support liquid power markets and free flow of energy, which are crucial to facilitate the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, thereby promoting a sustainable future.




Forecasting power generation from renewables is crucial for price discovery, risk management and for balancing the power grid. Recent advances in ML/AI/Neural based weather modeling promise models which are orders of magnitude faster to run than traditional physics-based numerical weather models.




Your work as our new ML Weather Scientist will involve turning massive data sets of weather data into machine learning models that accurately predict short-term weather patterns and power production from renewables.




You will get instant validation of your work and experience short feedback cycles, where going from inception to deployment can be a matter of hours. There will be no red tape to cut and no sales people to consult. We are centrally located in Copenhagen and have 55 bright and ambitious team members.




About the Team

All of this will happen in an informal atmosphere where technical discussions are valued, and you are encouraged to take ownership of, and pride in, your work. You will impact the direction of the team, prioritize your work and choose the tools that get the job done. We are a tight-knit modeling team with passionate quantitative analysts covering 6 nationalities ‚Äì a combination of PhD‚Äôs and MSc‚Äôs with expertise in statistical analysis, mathematical modeling and machine learning. We enjoy collaboration and are always willing to lend a helping hand. We are working alongside two other teams of software developers and economists that implement and conceive the mathematical models together with us. What makes this constellation work great is that all of the individual team members write code and understand that a seemingly trivial change can actually require a lot of work, and vice versa.




About You

Experience with ML/AI/Neural-based weather forecasting (GraphCast etc)
Experience with Deep Learning and Neural Networks
PhD or MSc degree in engineering, physics, computer science or relevant field
Familiar with terms like ECMWF IFS, HRRR, GFS, GOES etc.
Proficiency within computer science fundamentals, mathematics and statistics
Programming experience with Python, in particular data-wrangling and numerical programming
A scientific and inquisitive mind







What we can Offer You

Flat hierarchy and high levels of trust and autonomy
Exciting problems to solve
Collaborative team made up of really smart and curious people
Nice office in central Copenhagen with a hybrid work model
Pension, Health Insurance and 30 days of vacation




Practicalities

To apply, please send us your CV and a cover letter telling us why you think this role is a great fit for you. If your profile looks like a good match, we will get in touch to coordinate an online technical test as a first step in the interview process.




Please note! Due to our hiring team being away for the summer holidays, our response time has slowed. You should expect to hear back from us regarding your application in August. Thank you for your patience.

Gennemsigtighed er en af kernev√¶rdierne i Vertica, og derfor ligger vores personaleh√•ndbog frit tilg√¶ngeligt her. I personaleh√•ndbogen kan du l√¶se, hvilke vilk√•r vi - og alle vores fremtidige kolleger - arbejder under.

Livslang l√¶ring: Vi g√•r i livets skole, men af og til er der ogs√• kurser, konferencer eller uddannelser, som man kan l√¶re af. Er det noget du gerne vil blive klogere p√•, har du muligheden for at videreuddanne dig i Vertica. Vi har sat uddannelsesbudgettet frit.

Det sociale: Sociale arrangementer holder vi mange af. Det kan v√¶re alt fra klatring, padeltennis, byg-dit-eget-tastatur og cocktail-kursus til familietur i Djurs Sommerland. Derudover tager vi hvert √•r p√• en firmaweekend, hvor vi har fokus p√• hygge, god mad og socialt samv√¶r.




Hele mennesker p√• arbejde: Vi tror p√• at der er andet i livet end arbejde og derfor er det vigtigt for os at vi holder os inden for en 37-timers arbejdsuge.




Kan du se dig selv som en del af Vertica?

Lyder dette som et dr√∏mmejob? S√• send din ans√∏gning og CV hurtigst muligt.

Vi er klar over, at det er umuligt at give et fuldst√¶ndigt og retvisende billede af dig selv ud fra en ans√∏gning og CV alene, men indledningsvist er det desv√¶rre alt, vi har. Vi vil gerne l√¶re personen bag ans√∏gningen s√• godt at kende som muligt. Fort√¶l os derfor om din passion og dine v√¶rdier. Din historie og dine dr√∏mme. Og ikke mindst hvordan du er projektleder og dit syn p√• projektledelse.

Hvis du vil g√∏re en forskel for vores kunder gennem banebrydende l√∏sninger, er du pr√¶cis den, vi leder efter, som vores nye Data Scientist til vores hovedkontor i Aarhus.




Din hverdag

Som en del af vores voksende data-team arbejder du sammen med et team af kolleger med forskellig baggrund og kompetencer. Det, der binder jer sammen, er jeres store interesse for data, AI og forretningsudvikling ‚Äì og hvordan vi i Vertica kan hj√¶lpe vores kunder med at oms√¶tte data til vigtige indsigter, som kan v√¶re med til at flytte og styrke vores kunders forretning. Vertica er en h√∏jt specialiseret virksomhed med 140 medarbejdere fordelt p√• vores kontorer i hjertet af Aarhus og K√∏dbyen i K√∏benhavn. Vores kunder t√¶ller nogle af de st√∏rste og mest ambiti√∏se e-handelsvirksomheder i Danmark s√•som S√∏strene Grene, Br√∏drene Dahl, H√∏rkram og Louis Poulsen.




I din rolle kommer du med det rette data p√• det rette tidspunkt og i den rette kvalitet. Du skaber s√•ledes et st√¶rkt fundament for, at vores kunder har nem adgang til at arbejde med data og vigtigst af alt, at de kan s√¶tte handling bag data. Du er den f√∏rste i din rolle, og du vil derfor have rig mulighed for s√¶tte dit pr√¶g p√•, hvordan teamet skal udvikle sig og vokse fremover.




I din rolle vil du:

Designe, udvikle og implementere machine learning-modeller og algoritmer
Udforske og analysere store, komplekse datas√¶t for at identificere m√∏nstre og tendenser
Samarbejde med forskellige forretningsomr√•der for at forst√• deres behov og oms√¶tte data til strategiske indsigter
Kommunikere resultater og anbefalinger til b√•de tekniske og ikke-tekniske interessenter
Bidrage til at definere best practices og standarder for data science i organisationen

Praktisk erfaring med machine learning og dataanalyse i Azure, herunder brug af tjenester som Azure Machine Learning og Azure Cognitive Services.
Dybtg√•ende forst√•else for statistik, sandsynlighedsteori og machine learning-teknikker
Erfaring med at arbejde med store datas√¶t og datavisualiseringsv√¶rkt√∏jer som f.eks. PowerBI
Evne til at formidle komplekse, tekniske koncepter til forskellige m√•lgrupper
Proaktiv og l√¶renem med en passion for at l√∏se udfordrende problemer
Erfaring med andre Microsoft-teknologier som Azure Data Factory, Azure Stream Analytics og Azure Data Lake er et plus men ikke et krav.
Kendskab til data engineering-opgaver, herunder ETL-processer, datamodellering og backendudvikling er et plus men ikke et krav.
Du taler flydende dansk og engelsk




Og nu til alt det, vi gerne vil tilbyde dig!




Gennemsigtighed er en af kernev√¶rdierne i Vertica, og derfor ligger vores personaleh√•ndbog frit tilg√¶ngeligt her. I personaleh√•ndbogen kan du l√¶se, hvilke vilk√•r vi - og alle vores fremtidige kolleger - arbejder under. Hvis ikke du har tid til at l√¶se hele h√•ndbogen igennem, s√• har vi fremh√¶vet nogle af dem, vi s√¶tter s√¶rligt pris p√•.




Livslang l√¶ring: Vi g√•r i livets skole, men af og til er der ogs√• kurser, konferencer eller uddannelser, som man kan l√¶re af. Er det noget du gerne vil blive klogere p√•, har du muligheden for at videreuddanne dig i Vertica. Vi har sat uddannelsesbudgettet frit.

Det sociale: Sociale arrangementer holder vi mange af. Det kan v√¶re alt fra klatring, padeltennis, byg-dit-eget-tastatur og cocktail-kursus til familietur i Djurs Sommerland. Derudover tager vi hvert √•r p√• en firmaweekend, hvor vi har fokus p√• hygge, god mad og socialt samv√¶r.




Hele mennesker p√• arbejde: Vi tror p√• at der er andet i livet end arbejde og derfor er det vigtigt for os at vi holder os inden for en 37-timers arbejdsuge.




Kan du se dig selv som en del af Vertica?

Lyder dette som et dr√∏mmejob? S√• send din ans√∏gning og CV hurtigst muligt.

Vi er klar over, at det er umuligt at give et fuldst√¶ndigt og retvisende billede af dig selv ud fra en ans√∏gning og CV alene, men indledningsvist er det desv√¶rre alt, vi har.

Kunne du t√¶nke dig at arbejde i et internationalt, fagligt st√¶rkt og nyskabende arbejdsmilj√∏ inden for Vision-industrien? S√• er det m√•ske dig, vi s√∏ger!




JAI er f√∏rende global producent af h√∏jkvalitets, industrielle kameraer til forskellige markeder, herunder maskinsyn, transport, f√∏devare- og drikkevareindustrien, luftfart, medicinsk og den videnskabelige sektor.




Som Applications Engineer bliver du bindeleddet mellem udviklingen (back-end) og kunderne, og du f√•r en altafg√∏rende rolle i, at skabe tillidsfulde og trov√¶rdige relationer til kunderne gennem dialog, r√•dgivning og sparring. Du kommer til at arbejde med integration og fejlfinding via JAI‚Äôs software development kit samt kundernes applikationer, for at tilpasse de enkelte produkter.




Global virksomhed med samarbejde p√• tv√¶rs af landegr√¶nser

I stillingen som Applications Engineer bliver du en del af afdelingen, Global Application Support, der best√•r af 8 dygtige kolleger fordelt p√• 6 lande, hvoraf 3 sidder i Danmark. Teamet er kendetegnet ved en udpr√¶get hold√•nd, h√∏j faglighed og en god portion humor. Du vil referere til VP for Strategy & Digital Innovation, og du bliver en del af en organisation med flad ledelsesstruktur i et positivt og professionelt samarbejdsklima, hvor der i h√∏j grad lyttes til initiativer og gode id√©er.




Du f√•r en central rolle i organisationen i forhold til at udvikle samt drive afg√∏rende projekter, og du vil f√• et stort personligt ansvar for forretningskritiske opgaver. Har du kompetencerne og √∏nsket, er der i stillingen ogs√• mulighed for at avancere til Manager.




Du vil f√• f√∏lgende arbejdsopgaver:

At h√•ndtere teknisk kr√¶vende henvendelser fra kunder via Zendesk og pr. E-mail.
At opbygge og facilitere forbindelse mellem kamerahardware og eksisterende billedbehandlingsbiblioteker, til at skrive/teste scripts og v√¶re involveret i applikationsrelateret softwareudvikling.
At opbygge test, der replicerer kundernes udfordringer, unders√∏ge sammenh√¶nge og √•rsager, og p√• baggrund af unders√∏gelserne komme med anbefalinger og l√∏sninger.
At yde sparring omkring hardware ud fra din dybdeg√•ende viden om sensorer, kameraer, optik mv.
At give feedback og komme med anbefalinger til R&D-ingeni√∏rerne baseret p√• kundernes feedback og krav.
At assistere salg med at afslutte ordrer p√• baggrund af software relaterede problemer.




Din profil og faglighed

Vi leder efter dig, der har lyst til at engagere sig fagligt, men ogs√• motiveres af at s√¶tte sig ind i nye ansvarsomr√•der samt l√¶re nye teknologier. Du stiller dig ikke tilfreds med halve l√∏sninger, men er derimod nysgerrig, kvalitetsbevidst, proaktiv og ambiti√∏s.




Vi forestiller os, at du har en bachelor eller kandidat indenfor Engineering eller IT/Software. Derudover har du basale programmeringsf√¶rdigheder i C++ eller Python samt solide samarbejds- og kommunikationsevner, som kommer dig til gavn i en global organisation.




Det er en fordel, hvis du tidligere har stiftet kendskab til embedded software og machine vision applikationer.

I Moment varetager vi rekrutteringen af JAI‚Äôs nye Applications Engineer. Vi evaluerer l√∏bende ans√∏gninger, og n√•r rette kandidat er fundet, lukker vi stillingen ned.
