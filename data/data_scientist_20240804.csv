Neben der Beratung entwickeln und betreiben wir Software, um den Weg zu Klimaneutralität zu planen und zu begleiten. Energiewirtschaftliche Exzellenz aus mehr als 30 Jahren LBD-Beratungs- und Projekterfahrung übersetzen wir dabei in standardisierte Softwarelösungen Mithilfe geodatenbasierter Algorithmik – in Form eines digitalen Zwillings der realen Welt digitalisieren wir den Infrastrukturumbau.

Für die kommunale Wärmeplanung bieten wir unsere Software INFRA Planungs- und Ingenieurbüros als SaaS-Lösung an. Energieversorger unterstützen wir ganzheitlich mit teils individuellen Enterprise-Lösungen. Für die damit verbundenen Aufgaben brauchen wir Menschen, die den Startup-Geist in sich tragen und Lust haben, unser Geschäft und den noch jungen Markt der digitalen Wärmeplanung maßgeblich mitzugestalten.

Wir suchen dich als Data Scientist (m/w/d) für die digitale Wärmeplanung

Gemeinsam mit dem LBD-Team „Digital“ stellst du dich der Herausforderung, uns als Unternehmen sowie unsere Kunden und Partner aus dem Bereich der „Digitalen Wärmeplanung“ dazu zu befähigen, ein datengetriebenes Unternehmen zu werden.

Aufgaben


Du entwickelst und pflegst Routinen zur Metadaten­ex­tra­ktion aus Mediendaten.
Du erstellst und verwaltest Jobs zur automatischen Daten­verarbeitung für Raster- und Vektordatensätze (z.B. reprojection, merging, photogrammetry).
Du konzipierst, entwickelst und betreibst (Geo-)Daten­banken und darauf aufbauende (Geo-)APIs
Du entwickelst mit dem Team effiziente und durch­dachte End-To-End Lösungen in einer dynamischen und agilen Arbeitsumgebung nach der Scrum-Methode.


Profil


Abgeschlossenes Hochschulstudium (idealerweise in einer stark quantitativen Disziplin, wie z. B. der Fachrichtungen Geowissenschaft, Ingenieurswissenschaft, (Geo-)Informatik, Mathematik oder Physik) oder eine vergleichbare Qualifikation.
Du bringst eine starke Affinität für Daten, Daten­struk­turen, -prozesse und Algorithmen mit, hast demnach ein sehr ausgeprägtes analytisches Denk­ver­mögen. Zu­dem kommt Dein besonderes Interesse, Deine Eigen­schaften und Fähigkeiten in gesellschaftlich aktuelle wie hochrelevante Themen­gebiete, wie z. B. der „Energie- und Wärmewende“ gewinnbringend einzubringen.
Du verfügst über umfassende Fachkenntnisse zur An­wen­­dung von GIS-Systemen (QGIS) und bringst idealer­weise auch profunde Berufserfahrung in der Durch­führung von GIS-Projekten
Du bringst fundierte Vorerfahrung mit Python und eine Leidenschaft für sauberes Design mit.
Du hast bereits mit verschiedenen Datenbanktypen gear­beitet (Geo, SQL, NoSQL, Vektor) und das Wissen darüber, wann welche Art der Technologie sinnvoll eingesetzt werden kann und wie die Datenhaltung und Zugriffe effizient und sicher gestaltet werden können.
Du arbeitest gerne selbstständig und lösungsorientiert, stets dem eigenen Anspruch folgend, den best­mög­lichen Datenbestand, Automatisierungsprozess oder Digitalisierungsgrad einer Aufgabenstellung zu finden und umzusetzen


Wir bieten


Ein dynamisches und innovatives Arbeitsumfeld in einem engagierten und interdisziplinären Team.
Spannende und herausfordernde Aufgaben zur Umsetzung der Wärmewende
Möglichkeiten zur persönlichen und beruflichen Weiterentwicklung.
30 Tage Urlaub
Flexible Arbeitszeiten ohne Kern-, aber mit Vertrauensarbeitszeit, Teilzeitmöglichkeiten und mobiles Arbeiten
Zusatzleistungen wie kostenlose Fitnessmitgliedschaft, kostenloses Essen und Getränke, exklusive Veranstaltungen
Zuschuss zur betrieblichen Altersvorsorge

Within our team of experts on large-scale machine learning and data handling, you will work on improving, benchmarking and extending our family of best-in-class foundations models, bridging image, text and other pathology data modalities. Moreover, using our foundation models you will contribute to developing prototypes for new applications to assist pathologists and generate new insights for improving cancer treatment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

About the Team

The Selection Analytics Team at Wolt owns the data and infrastructure that helps all 27 of our markets build a portfolio of high-quality restaurant and retail merchants. Our overarching mission is to provide the best selection to customers by enabling sales teams across all markets to acquire the best merchants.

To do this, we work directly with country sales teams to help them identify and prioritize the highest potential merchant candidates. We also work with Wolt leadership by providing metrics to track selection quality, upon which they develop strategic initiatives and goals. This is a lean and mighty team that owns and operates the engine for merchant acquisition globally.

About The Role

As a senior member of the Selection Analytics team, your role involves leveling up our approach to identifying and prioritizing better merchants. You’ll achieve this by a) developing metrics to unlock deeper insights into merchant selection quality for all markets b) developing and running experiments to understand the impact of selection on specific markets c) develop self-serve tooling to track these insights

This is also a rare, high-exposure experience where you will then use your findings to work directly with country leadership to help them uncover growth opportunities. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just crunching numbers and creating dashboards.

The team is looking for a versatile analytics expert who knows how to move fast, work cross-functionally, and deliver business results. If you are excited to build from 0 to 1, interested in global exposure, and have experience using deep analytics to solve hard problems - we're looking for someone like you.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these cities - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.

Our humble expectations


3-5 years of experience in data science, consulting, or related quantitative role
Strong exploratory data analysis skills, willingness to look under the hood.
Deep understanding of the data science workflow, including experimental design and key statistical methods, with strong communication skills for complex topics.
Proficiency in statistical programming languages (R, Python, etc.) and SQL.
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g. Looker)
Determination to initiate and lead/own strategic projects to completion in a scrappy environment with a cross-functional team
Innate curiosity to understand how things work and a first-principles approach to problem solving


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Lead - Marta Palac (marta.palac@wolt.com).

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 700+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 60 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together.

About the Team

The Selection Analytics Team at Wolt owns the data and infrastructure that helps all 27 of our markets build a portfolio of high-quality restaurant and retail merchants. Our overarching mission is to provide the best selection to customers by enabling sales teams across all markets to acquire the best merchants.

To do this, we work directly with country sales teams to help them identify and prioritize the highest potential merchant candidates. We also work with Wolt leadership by providing metrics to track selection quality, upon which they develop strategic initiatives and goals. This is a lean and mighty team that owns and operates the engine for merchant acquisition globally.

About The Role

As a senior member of the Selection Analytics team, your role involves leveling up our approach to identifying and prioritizing better merchants. You’ll achieve this by a) developing metrics to unlock deeper insights into merchant selection quality for all markets b) developing and running experiments to understand the impact of selection on specific markets c) develop self-serve tooling to track these insights

This is also a rare, high-exposure experience where you will then use your findings to work directly with country leadership to help them uncover growth opportunities. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just crunching numbers and creating dashboards.

The team is looking for a versatile analytics expert who knows how to move fast, work cross-functionally, and deliver business results. If you are excited to build from 0 to 1, interested in global exposure, and have experience using deep analytics to solve hard problems - we're looking for someone like you.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these cities - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.

Our humble expectations


3-5 years of experience in data science, consulting, or related quantitative role
Strong exploratory data analysis skills, willingness to look under the hood.
Deep understanding of the data science workflow, including experimental design and key statistical methods, with strong communication skills for complex topics.
Proficiency in statistical programming languages (R, Python, etc.) and SQL.
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g. Looker)
Determination to initiate and lead/own strategic projects to completion in a scrappy environment with a cross-functional team
Innate curiosity to understand how things work and a first-principles approach to problem solving


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Lead - Marta Palac (marta.palac@wolt.com).

Du arbeitest für unsere Customer IT

Unsere Customer IT entwickelt und betreibt in enger Kooperation mit Fachabteilungen spezialisierte IT-Lösungen, die unsere mehr als 5 Millionen nationalen Endverbraucher unterstützen, die Effizienz unserer Service Partner im Call Center Betrieb sicherstellen und unsere regulatorischen Marktaufgaben ermöglichen. Die Customer-IT ist dabei in Deutschland auf sechs Teams mit Kolleg:innen sowohl in Hamburg als auch in Berlin aufgeteilt.

Nach einer Vielzahl erfolgreicher Piloten und dem produktiven Massenroll-Out ambitionierter BI/AI/ML Services ist die Entscheidung gefallen, unser lokales „Customer Analytics“ Team dramatisch zu stärken! Wir haben deshalb eine Anzahl zusätzlicher Positionen geschaffen, wobei drei jetzt unterschiedliche Rollen zur Ausschreibung kommen:


(Junior/Senior) Machine Learning Engineer
Solution Architekt “BI/AI/ML Solutions” Germany
(Junior/Senior) Data & ML Engineer AWS


Du schlägst die Brücke zwischen IT-Technologie und Business Mehrwert

Unser Customer Analytics Team besteht aus mehr als 25 hochspezialisierten Data Engineers, Data Scientists, Application Consultants, Entwickler:innen und ML Engineers. Das schlagkräftige Team zeichnet sich durch seine breite Aufstellung, unterschiedliche Karrierewege sowie eine hohe Fach- und Prozesskompetenz aus. Sein Anspruch ist, die internationale Vattenfall Gruppe bezüglich Machine Learning und Data Engineering vorwärts zu bringen und an der „Grenze des technisch Machbaren“ zu befähigen.

Als Machine Learning (ML) Engineer stößt Du explorative Pilotprojekte an und implementierst innovative Lösungen rund um unsere cloudbasierte analytische Plattform, die beständig um die neuesten Microsoft Azure Technologie erweitert wird. Dir steht das ganze Spektrum der Microsoft Azure AI Services inkl. Azure OpenAI, Azure Functions, Cognitive Search sowie eigene Entwicklungen in Python, R, (Py)Spark, SQL DBs, Azure Data Factory, Databricks oder SAP BWonHANA bis hin zu differenzierenden AWS-Komponenten zur Verfügung.

Wir ermöglichen Dir, die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette abzudecken: von der Anbindung unterschiedlicher Datenquellen (ETL) bis zur Entwicklung komplexer Abfrage- und Analyseroutinen sowie der Umsetzung zielgruppengerechter Visualisierungslösungen; Du machst den Unterschied!

Neben Deiner Technologie- und Lösungskompetenz überzeugt dabei Dein ganzheitlicher Beratungsansatz. Du trägst mit dazu bei, dass Vattenfall seine führende Position auf dem deutschen Energiemarkt festigt, die fossil-freie Energiewende Wirklichkeit wird und unsere Business Prozesse skalierbar, digital, daten-getrieben und durchgehend kundenorientiert ablaufen.

A major contributor to why people stay in their jobs is they have (and can clearly see / measure) a direct impact on their business.




Without it people can often feel lost.




In this role as a Data Scientist, everything you do is measurable. A lot of what you do is focused around optimisation so you can clearly see the impact you can have on the business (one model on a previous project saved £5m last year!).




That meaning is a lot, but with a very impressive 40% bonus which is partly influenced by things like that, you can have a financial impact on yourself too!




This role is that of a Lead; you are tried and tested, and can act as the right-hand person to the manager to bounce ideas off. You’ll have one direct report to look after and mentor and report into the Head of Data Science. You’re all about optimisation and probably have a solid background in Causal Modelling & Uplift Modelling.




Ideal background

Several years as a Data Scientist to allow both team and independent work
Excellent stakeholder management & communication – its technical AND people focussed
Causal Modelling & Uplift Modelling techniques are your bread & butter
AirFlow (or other Orchestration tools)




Salary is up to £110,000 + 40% bonus, 3 days WFH, flexible hours, 25 days holiday, Private pension and 6% matched pension.

That’s waiting for you at Sainsbury’s. Think about the scale it takes for us to feed the nation. The level of data, transactions and variety it involves. Then you’ll realise that ours is a modern software engineering environment because it has to be. We’ve made serious investment into a Tech Academy and into setting standards and principles. We iterate, learn, experiment and push ways of working such as Agile, Scrum and XP. So you can look forward to awesome opportunities in everything from AI to reusable tech.

Sainsburys Tech - AI/ML Engineer - Python

What you'll do

We build data AI/ML data products that underpin key commercial decisions across the business, bring intelligent automation at scale to operational systems, and build out AI/ML microservices that power colleague and customer-facing applications.

As AI/ML Engineer, you will support these products from inception to decom. This requires working across the full data ecosystem: developing application-specific data pipelines (features), building CICD pipelines that automate the training and deployment of machine learning models, publishing the model results for downstream consumption, and/or building out the APIs that serve model outputs to downstream systems on-demand.

As we put more and more AI/ML into production we're also defining the patterns and templates for doing this efficiently and repeatably. As part of the role, you contribute to the design and development of AI/ML capabilities and best practices. So we’re product-focused and big on design — especially building out products from start to finish. There’s lots of code writing involved, plus automation including deployments and testing (CICD). You’ll also be focused on Monitoring and Alerting tools for live applications.

Throughout, you’ll build relationships with your colleagues. Working alongside Data Science colleagues in end-to-end teams, you'll have an opportunity to learn more about the ‘Data Science’ side of AI/ML development: i.e. the processes of model, selection, fitting, and evaluation. You’ll do pair programming to diagnose an elusive bug, jump on a Pull Request when it needs your input, and contribute to overall solution design. You'll champion best-practices and engineering standards.

Who you are

You bring epert knowledge of Python, Github and either (AWS/Azure). You'll ideally have experience working with Snowflake and Terraform too. You'll have experience as a Data Engineer, Backend Software Engineer, Analytics Enginneer, ML Engineer, or similar

Initiative and curiosity are going to be crucial and you’ll also prefer to take ownership of your work so that you can see it through. And don’t be afraid to share your point of view — we love new thinking.

We are committed to being a truly inclusive retailer, so you’ll be welcomed whoever you are and wherever you work. Around here, there’s always the chance to try something new - whether that’s as part of an evolving team or somewhere else across the business - and we take development seriously and promise to support you. We also recognise and celebrate colleagues when they go the extra mile and, where possible, offer flexible working. When you join our team, we’ll also offer you an amazing range of benefits. Here are some of them:

Starting off with colleague discount, you'll be able to get 10% off at Sainsbury's, Argos, TU and Habitat after 4 weeks. This increases to 15% off at Sainsbury’s every Friday and Saturday and 15% off at Argos every pay day. We've also got you covered for your future with our pensions scheme and life cover. You'll also be able to share in our success as you may be eligible for a performance-related bonus of up to 10% of salary, depending on how we perform.

Your wellbeing is important to us too. You'll receive an annual holiday allowance, and you can buy additional holiday. We also offer other benefits that will help your money go further such as season ticket loans, cycle to work scheme, health cash plans, pay advance (where you can access some of your pay before pay day) as well access to a great range of discounts from hundreds of other retailers. And if you ever need it there is also an employee assistance programme.

Moments that matter are as important to us as they are to you which is why we give up to 26 weeks’ pay for maternity or adoption leave and up to 4 weeks’ pay for paternity leave.

Please see www.sainsburys.jobs for a range of our benefits (note, length of service and eligibility criteria may apply).

Every Cure is a start-up, nonprofit drug development organization on a mission to alleviate suffering for the ~300 million people worldwide battling diseases without FDA-approved treatments by unlocking hidden cures. We are building a first-of-its-kind, AI-powered platform to identify FDA-approved treatments that can be repurposed for untreated diseases. Inspired by our success in repurposing over a dozen drugs for new uses, including one that is saving Dr. David Fajgenbaum's own life, we are committed to unlocking the full potential of FDA-approved drugs to treat every disease and patient possible.

Our groundbreaking approach revolves around building an open-source database and employing cutting-edge tools to identify drug repurposing opportunities. Since launching at the 2022 Clinton Global Initiative, we have received tremendous media attention and recognition including the 2023 Elevate Prize Foundation Founder’s Award, attracted leaders from across industries, been invited to share about our work at the White House, Aspen Ideas, and a Congressional Caucus Briefing, and demonstrated the life-saving potential of our platform.

Four Strategic Pillars Guide Our Efforts


Using an AI engine to identify promising drug repurposing opportunities.
Prioritizing high-impact opportunities which affect neglected patient communities.
Efficiently validating promising opportunities through laboratory and clinical studies.
Ensuring everyone has equitable access to new cures.


As a nonprofit organization, we are able to focus on maximizing patient impact and saving lives without needing to consider the commercial viability of drugs, including the 80% that are already generic and completely neglected. Our team, comprising experts in drug discovery, data analysis, and clinical trials, collaborates with entities ranging from philanthropic organizations to biopharmaceutical industries including Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Flagship Pioneering, Clinton Global Initiative, Elevate Prize Foundation, and Lyda Hill Philanthropies, among others.

The Every Cure team is expanding rapidly and seeking top-notch, purpose-driven professionals to perform a range of tasks to save lives with hidden cures. This is a unique opportunity to join a highly motivated, patient-focused team based in Philadelphia, PA and New York City that works closely with international collaborators, government agencies, academic researchers, philanthropic organizations, and biopharmaceutical companies to make a significant impact on patients with major unmet medical needs.

With nearly 40 years of experience in monetization topics of all kinds, we are regarded as the world’s leading pricing and growth specialist.




This opportunity offers a unique entry into Consulting as a Data Science Intern, particularly focusing on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in our UK and Netherlands projects.




What you bring:

As a Data Scientist at Simon-Kucher, you will be an integral part of the project teams working to drive top-line growth for our clients, linked primarily with our UK and Netherlands focused projects. You will be responsible for the core components of the model development process, from data wrangling / pre-processing to Machine Learning model development, testing, and implementation. Throughout this process, you will also gather and communicate meaningful data insights to your project team. We are looking for internship candidates who are interested in learning more about a career in commercial strategy consulting. We have entry level Data Scientist positions available for top performing interns upon completion of the internship. You must be graduated or graduating this summer to be eligible to apply.

Exceptional communication skills to effectively convey complex data insights.
High percentile numerical, deductive and inductive reasoning skills.
A keen interest in commercial strategy and a desire to work in a dynamic, fast-paced environment.
Strong enthusiasm, curiosity, and a commitment to achieving the best outcomes.

What we offer:

Internships within the Data Science team usually last around 8 weeks and are designed to expose individuals to working on client projects. Interns can expect responsibility from the outset as a valued member of the project team. Throughout your time at Simon-Kucher, you will contribute to analysis and results and can benefit from working alongside experienced Consultants, Directors and Partners.
Simon-Kucher is growing. This results in an entrepreneurial and inspiring work environment with lots of responsibilities and a steep learning curve. Internships are the main route we use to recruit entry level Consultants to our London office, so if you perform well during your time as an intern there is the real opportunity to continue your career with us.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

You can squish bugs like a crazed entomologist. And your design solutions are more elegant than an Italian countess. 

If that sounds like you AND you love a fun, collaborative workday where you get to help gazillions of people transform their lives; let's talk! 

AlgaeCal is looking for an Intermediate Front End Developer to bring their wizardry to our fun-loving Dev team.

Small print here ⇒ We're an eCommerce company. So, we want you to have eCommerce experience. Lots of it. So if you don't love digital marketing the way Elon loves Elon, you probably shouldn't read any further. 

Still here? Okay then...

This job will give you ALL the feels:

At AlgaeCal, we're driven by a single idea. To end the fear of bone loss. In the United States, an estimated 54 million people have low bone density. 

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world's only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you'll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal. 

You'll love it here:

You'll be working with a great team. The developers at AlgaeCal have been there, done that, and got the t-shirt. They've written more code than Alan Turing. They've learned more programming languages than C3PO. They've immersed themselves in so many development tasks that they've had to be pulled out of the Matrix by their ankles on a Friday evening. And the best part? They're friendly, funny, and easy to work with.
You'll use your powers for good. This isn't one of those jobs that crush your soul with mindless tasks. On the contrary! You'll be working on a wide range of applications that helps spread a powerful message - bone loss is beatable. 
You won't be micromanaged. We'll give you a simple set of KPIs with crystal clear expectations.
We don't have mattresses at the office (Seriously Elon, what's up with that?!?). You'll be relieved to know this isn't one of those Silicon Valley gigs that expects you to work ridiculously long hours and frowns upon family time. We're not like that! We enjoy our life, and we want you to enjoy yours too. 

This job might be for you if you've got...

A resume that wows us. We expect you'll have proven front-end web development skills.
2+ years of experience in a software development role would be preferred. You'll be able to provide us with examples of your work in a wide variety of coding niches.
An encyclopedic knowledge of Semantic HTML, Javascript (> ES 2016), CSS & Sass. 
We'd also love you to have worked with jQuery, Handlebars.js, Liquid, React, and Vue.
A yoda-like ability to develop and deploy features for our WordPress blog and website templates.
A portfolio that demonstrates your mastery of all-things dev. Sorry, but if you have to Google ‘Bitbucket'; or you've never heard of ‘AWS', this isn't the position for you. 
Next level bug resolving skills. In fact, you're so good at dealing with bugs you should probably be deployed on a mission to Klendathu.


If you're reading this and thinking, ""Wow, that sounds exactly like me!"" We would love to hear from you. If it doesn't, no worries! We're only seeking candidates who will immediately light up this role. 

What Will You Earn? 

Our Intermediate Front End Developer position starts at $70,000 and can go up to $85,000 depending on your experience. If your salary expectations differ from this range, let us know! 

Other Goodies

A generous healthcare package
Monthly team events and activities
Flexible Stat Holidays with the option to bank days for later use
Weekly team lunches
Hybrid work environment (we work from home 2 days a week)
Casual dress code
Incredible dog friendly, Yaletown office one block from SkyTrain
Professional Development: You'll get the opportunity to attend professional development conferences or workshops that will enhance your skills, expand your network, and drive your career forward with our support! And of course, we'll cover your fees, accommodation, travel, meals, and any related materials or resources.  

And above all, you'll join a team that you'll never want to leave. Culture is everything to us. Yes, we work extremely hard to change as many people's lives as possible. But we know how to have fun and reward ourselves too.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The most successful businesses are always in motion. We see this all the time with businesses that come to Stripe in one state, or for one set of things, and deepen their relationship with Stripe alongside rapid growth. To take an example, in January, Best Buy chose Stripe to power its expansion into prescription health and wellness technology products. To support growth like this, businesses have historically had to create a new Stripe account for each global entity or business unit. Organizations allow you to manage all your Stripe accounts in one place. As Stripe grows its suite of product offerings beyond payments, Connect and Organizations will unlock a new phase of growth for Stripe by enabling our platforms and businesses to model their complex businesses and distribute all of Stripe’s products to their end users.

Specifically, our team is responsible for Accounts APIs and dashboard surfaces that every Stripe user relies on throughout their business lifecycle. As part of revamping our Accounts Platform for the next decade plus, we have the opportunity to solve challenging user pain points at scale, model complex businesses spanning multiple countries and build a granular, expressive framework powering users’ onboarding experience as well as that of their own end users.

A strong foundation of customizable account structures and interoperable APIs is critical to Stripe’s long-term success. It’s important we get the set of core business blocks right – that we understand how businesses of all sizes model their organizational structures and think about their relationships, and we ensure that integrating with Stripe is nothing short of a fantastic experience. We are applying Stripe’s developer-centric approach to building the flexible, programmable representation of humans and businesses that map across Stripe’s existing and future products.

We are hiring for multiple full stack engineering roles.

What you’ll do

Engineers on the team will build end-to-end features for Stripe’s Accounts APIs fundamental to the onboarding and management experience of every Stripe user, including Stripe’s largest Connect and multi-entity users with complex integrations. We are seeking engineers who are excited to develop features for these foundations as well as their higher-level dashboard surfaces, delivering best-in-class product experiences for our users.

Responsibilities


Build beautiful end-to-end user experiences as well as high-performance APIs that power them
Ensure our infrastructure is extensible, scalable, reliable, and meets SLAs for both external and internal users
Collaborate with cross-functional partner teams to deliver delightful developer experiences and comprehensive interfaces with core account and money movement primitives
Hide complexity from our users behind simple yet powerful abstractions



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Strong technical background, including 2+ years of experience as a full stack engineer
Empathetic, collaborative, and user-first mindset in everything you build
Interest in working as a generalist across varying technologies and stacks to solve problems and delight both internal and external users
Ability to stitch together many different services together even if you have not worked with them before
Preference for simple solutions and designs over complex ones, and having a good intuition for what is lasting and scalable
The skills to build holistically – from specs and documentation to implementation, testing, deployment, and measuring impact



Preferred Qualifications


Passion for helping those around you grow and learn, as well as a passion for working with those who do the same
Propensity to ask questions, assume good intentions, and defaulting to transparency



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$134,400 - C$201,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Payment Intelligence ML organization optimizes each of the billions of dollars of transactions processed by Stripe annually on behalf of our customers, maximizing successful transactions while minimizing payment costs and fraud. We leverage ML to serve real-time predictions as part of Stripe’s payment infrastructure and risk controls. We own products like Radar, Adaptive Acceptance, and Identity end-to-end, operating lightning fast world-scale services and cutting-edge ML models.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $173,100 - $316,800. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We build machine learning services and data pipelines to automatically extract insights about competitors from both public and internal data sources. Every day, our services process millions of data points, including news articles, press releases, webpage changes, Slack posts, emails, reviews, CRM opportunities, and user actions. We utilize a broad array of ML techniques, including classification, clustering, recommendation, summarization, prompt engineering, vector search, and retrieval augmented generation.

💡Klue + You?

Q: Klue who?

A: We’re Klue and from a technical perspective, Klue’s mission is to descale huge amounts of data to the human level, so people can process it and make use of it. Klue is that trusted intermediary, right now it’s proven for sales enablement, but tomorrow it’s all teams enablement.

Q: What level of experience are we looking for?

A: Right now, we are looking for experienced senior-level Machine Learning Engineers.

Q: What are we working on?

A: Services for collecting, processing and generating timely, relevant intel that is accurately linked to competitors, products, industries, and people. Our Machine Learning Engineers are primarily focused on the training, evaluation, and deployment of models to label, score, cluster, and generate insights.

Q: What technologies do we use?

A: Python, Transformers, Pytorch, Hugging Face, Spacy, Sklearn, Pinecone, Kubeflow, Vertex AI, BentoML, Aporia, JS, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, GCP, BigQuery, Docker/Kubernetes, Github, GPT.

We believe in using whatever tools make sense to get the job done and support our game-changing innovation.

Q: What skills do you bring?


A: You are an expert on the landscape of transformer models and are proficient with popular ML frameworks such as PyTorch, Hugging Face, or Scikit-Learn.
You stay up to date on recent advances with LLMs and you demonstrate astute judgment in deciding whether to train a model with a custom architecture or leverage GPT.
You ensure your experiments are reproducible, balancing swift discovery with scientific rigor.
You are proficient in designing, implementing, and deploying RESTful APIs and you have experience with (non)relational and vector databases.
You demonstrate good judgment when making architectural decisions and you understand how those decisions fit into the bigger picture.


Q: How do teams work?


Hybrid. Best of both worlds (remote & in-office)
Our main Canadian hubs are in Vancouver and Toronto, and most of our teams are located in EST and PST.
You and your team will be in office at least 2 days per week.


Q: What about total compensation & benefits?


Benefits. We currently have extended health benefits starting on your 1st day.
Time off. Take what you need. We want the team to prioritize wellness and avoid burnout. Vacation usually falls into 3 categories: recharging, life-event, & keeping a work-life balance. Just ensure the required work gets done and clear it with your team in advance. You need to take at least two weeks off every year. The average Klue team member takes 2-4 weeks of PTO per year.


⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️

Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

Monitor: Continuously monitor success matrices of the assigned ML project and make continuous improvements for increasing model robustness and efficiency.
Data Analysis: Work closely with our Data Analysts to explore, analyze, and organize data; perform data extraction and preprocessing for training and evaluation purposes.
Document: Document model architecture, training details, dataset extraction, and cleaning procedures for reproducibility, product management, and internal training.




Opportunities to Learn

Applying deep learning to real world industrial datasets containing billions of images.
Exploration of the state-of-the-art methodologies in computer vision like self-supervised learning and unsupervised learning for the purpose of non-destructive testing.
Exposure to full ML lifecycle and orchestration management tools like Prefect, Kubeflow, AWS SageMaker, Weights, and Biases.
Converting ideas into intellectual property assets (e.g. patents).




Who You Are (Basic Qualifications)

Experience developing deep learning models for computer vision tasks.
Master’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering or a ML/AI related field; PhD preferred.

It does not matter which programming language is your primary and we accept engineers with Python (however, you must be willing to work using Swift). Previous Swift experience is not required.

Accepted Locations

We are accepting applicants from the US, Canada, and most countries in LATAM and Europe. We are accepting some countries in Africa and Asia. For the full list of accepted locations, click here. This work is 100% remote.

Loom Video

Our Founder/CEO, Gabe Greenberg, created a more in depth Loom video that we highly recommend you watch! Check it out here: https://www.loom.com/share/5a8972c7fbbf46aaa3f389b2b6391c40

Job Overview

We are currently seeking Developers for project-specific roles focused on RLHF. This role will play a key part in our reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) initiatives, contributing to cutting-edge projects.

You’ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for for the worlds most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the biggest players in the AI/LLM space today. We are seeking software engineers with 4+ years of experience to train AI large language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!

What Will I Be Doing?


Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""which piece of Python code is better?"" to ""make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterwards to make it faster""


Contract Length


This project is expected to last until the end of September and you'll be able to continue to work on other projects (though likely not in Swift).
You can end the contract at any time.


Flexible Schedules


Developers can set their own hours - ideal candidates will be interested in spending 15+ hours a week. They will be with teams, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but incredibly flexible on working hours.
Take a 3 hour lunch, no problem. You are paid according to time spent on the platform, which is calculated in the coding exercises, as opposed to tracking your own hours.


Compensation


US: $50 /hr
Brazil: $28.70/hr
Egypt: $22.05/hr
Phillipines: $25.55/hr
All other countries: $35/hr
Expectations are 15+ hours per week however there is no upper limit. We have engineers working 20-40 hrs per week and some that are working 40+ hours per week. You can work as much as you want to. You'll get paid on a weekly basis. You get paid per hour of work done on the platform.


Interview Process

We've created a 3.5 hour screening and onboarding process to join as a Software Engineer for AI Training Data which can be accomplished in 1 week or less. We purposely perform most of these steps asynchronously because most of the RLHF work is async and self guided. After you apply, if you look like a good fit we'll provide you access to the G2i dashboard to go through this simple screening process.

Step 1: Learn in depth about the role (35 min)

Step 2: Perform a simple RLHF code review (35 min)

Step 3: Receive platform credentials, pass ID verification (5 min), and choose your project (30 min).

Step 4: Perform a production level RLHF task (75 min) ""aka the final interview""

Join us: Based on your final interview, you'll will put you on the right difficulty RLHF project

Check it out here: https://www.loom.com/share/5a8972c7fbbf46aaa3f389b2b6391c40<br><br><strong>Job Overview<br><br></strong>We are currently seeking Developers for project-specific roles focused on RLHF. This role will play a key part in our reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) initiatives, contributing to cutting-edge projects.<br><br>You’ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for for the worlds most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the biggest players in the AI/LLM space today. We are seeking software engineers with 4+ years of experience to train AI large language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!<br><br><strong>What Will I Be Doing?<br><br></strong><ul><li>Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale</li><li>Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code</li><li>Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively</li><li>We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""which piece of Python code is better?"" to ""make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterwards to make it faster""<br><br></li></ul><strong>Contract Length<br><br></strong><ul><li>This project is expected to last until the end of September and you'll be able to continue to work on other projects (though likely not in Swift). </li><li>You can end the contract at any time. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Flexible Schedules<br><br></strong><ul><li>Developers can set their own hours - ideal candidates will be interested in spending 15+ hours a week. They will be with teams, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but incredibly flexible on working hours. </li><li>Take a 3 hour lunch, no problem. You are paid according to time spent on the platform, which is calculated in the coding exercises, as opposed to tracking your own hours. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Compensation<br><br></strong><ul><li>US: $50 /hr</li><li>Brazil: $28.70/hr</li><li>Egypt: $22.05/hr</li><li>Phillipines: $25.55/hr</li><li>All other countries: $35/hr</li><li>Expectations are 15+ hours per week however there is no upper limit. We have engineers working 20-40 hrs per week and some that are working 40+ hours per week. You can work as much as you want to. You'll get paid on a weekly basis. You get paid per hour of work done on the platform. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Interview Process<br><br></strong>We've created a 3.5 hour screening and onboarding process to join as a Software Engineer for AI Training Data which can be accomplished in 1 week or less. We purposely perform most of these steps asynchronously because most of the RLHF work is async and self guided. After you apply, if you look like a good fit we'll provide you access to the G2i dashboard to go through this simple screening process.<br><br><strong>Step 1: </strong>Learn in depth about the role (35 min)<br><br><strong>Step 2: </strong>Perform a simple RLHF code review (35 min)<br><br><strong>Step 3: </strong>Receive platform credentials, pass ID verification (5 min), and choose your project (30 min).<br><br><strong>Step 4: </strong>Perform a production level RLHF task (75 min) ""aka the final interview""<br><br><strong>Join us: </strong>Based on your final interview, you'll will put you on the right difficulty RLHF project<br><br>

From designing our data models to implementing the subtle interaction behaviors that differentiate good software from great software. We work closely with UX Designers, Product Managers, and Data Scientists throughout the entire product process, from conception to post-launch reflection.

We are looking for a Software Engineer to join the Login & Signup (LNS) team in our Vancouver Office. The LNS team is responsible for handling the registration and authentication of Asana's users, with emphasis on secure login for enterprise accounts, such as single sign-on through Identity Providers (Okta, OneLogin, Google SSO, etc.) and multi-factor authentication. It is a full-stack team; tech stack includes TypeScript/React and some Scala.

In enterprise applications, user account management and login is a challenging, multi-faceted technical space encompassing software security, compliance to industry standards and legal regulations, large-scale IT administration needs, and quality of end-user experience. LNS' goal is to create and maintain a best-in-class registration and authentication system for Asana: we want it to be compliant with the most recent security standards and regulations, safe for enterprises to adopt, fully integrated with leading identity management frameworks, while offering the most delightful, smooth and seamless user experience.

You’ll advocate for engineering best practices and work cross-functionally to define and build powerful admin features while influencing the team's velocity. You'll mentor other engineers and advocate for code and component quality, reusability, and consistency; and you'll be at the forefront of a new wave of consumer-like experiences for the enterprise and enjoy the challenge of balancing speed of execution with quality and building a product that users love.

This role is based in Vancouver, with an office-centric hybrid schedule. The standard in-office days are Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Most Asanas have the option to work from home on Wednesdays. Working from home on Fridays depends on the type of work you do and the teams with which you partner. If you're interviewing for this role, your recruiter will share more about the in-office requirements.

What You’ll Achieve


Work in a high-performance, dynamic team with a strong focus on velocity and software quality and people's professional development
Contribute to building a complex SaaS application that is a market leader in its segment
Collaborate with Product Managers and customers to understand the needs of IT admins of large enterprises, and identify features to satisfy those needs
Partner with our Product Security team to stay updated about security threats, vulnerabilities, and cutting-edge countermeasures to protect SaaS applications
Learn about state-of-the-art technologies, including single-sign on methods and integration with Identity Providers such as Okta and Azure AD
Drive large, impactful projects, delivering features rolled out and used in large organizations


About You


Experience driving projects of medium complexity autonomously and reliably, planning tasks through milestones and workstreams, coordinating multiple engineers, and delivering successfully and on time
Interested in working in a highly technical space, learn about state of the art registration and authentication technologies, and software security
Passion for software architecture and software quality
Strong commitment to building the best UX to delight consumer and enterprise users
Continuous improvement mindset and a drive to enhance the architecture, the code, and team processes
Enthusiasm for mentoring and coaching teammates and stakeholders and contributing to team growth
Relevant experience in the tech stack (React, Typescript, Scala, SQL) as well as in UX design are nice-to-haves
Relevant industry experience in authorization and software security is a big plus; if you hold this experience, make sure to emphasize it in your application


At Asana, we're committed to building teams that include a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, as this is critical to helping us achieve our mission. If you're interested in this role and don't meet every listed requirement, we still encourage you to apply.

What We’ll Offer

Our comprehensive compensation package plays a big part in how we recognize you for the impact you have on our path to achieving our mission. We believe that compensation should be reflective of the value you create relative to the market value of your role. To ensure pay is fair and not impacted by biases, we're committed to looking at market value which is why we check ourselves and conduct a yearly pay equity audit.

For this role, the estimated base salary range is between $146,000 - $178,000 CAD. The actual base salary will vary based on various factors, including market and individual qualifications objectively assessed during the interview process.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

It does not matter which programming language is your primary and we accept engineers with Python (however, you must be willing to work using Swift). Previous Swift experience is not required.

Accepted Locations

We are accepting applicants from the US, Canada, and most countries in LATAM and Europe. We are accepting some countries in Africa and Asia. For the full list of accepted locations, click here. This work is 100% remote.

Loom Video

Our Founder/CEO, Gabe Greenberg, created a more in depth Loom video that we highly recommend you watch! Check it out here: https://www.loom.com/share/5a8972c7fbbf46aaa3f389b2b6391c40

Job Overview

We are currently seeking Developers for project-specific roles focused on RLHF. This role will play a key part in our reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) initiatives, contributing to cutting-edge projects.

You’ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for for the worlds most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the biggest players in the AI/LLM space today. We are seeking software engineers with 4+ years of experience to train AI large language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!

What Will I Be Doing?


Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""which piece of Python code is better?"" to ""make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterwards to make it faster""


Contract Length


This project is expected to last until the end of September and you'll be able to continue to work on other projects (though likely not in Swift).
You can end the contract at any time.


Flexible Schedules


Developers can set their own hours - ideal candidates will be interested in spending 15+ hours a week. They will be with teams, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but incredibly flexible on working hours.
Take a 3 hour lunch, no problem. You are paid according to time spent on the platform, which is calculated in the coding exercises, as opposed to tracking your own hours.


Compensation


US: $50 /hr
Brazil: $28.70/hr
Egypt: $22.05/hr
Phillipines: $25.55/hr
All other countries: $35/hr
Expectations are 15+ hours per week however there is no upper limit. We have engineers working 20-40 hrs per week and some that are working 40+ hours per week. You can work as much as you want to. You'll get paid on a weekly basis. You get paid per hour of work done on the platform.


Interview Process

We've created a 3.5 hour screening and onboarding process to join as a Software Engineer for AI Training Data which can be accomplished in 1 week or less. We purposely perform most of these steps asynchronously because most of the RLHF work is async and self guided. After you apply, if you look like a good fit we'll provide you access to the G2i dashboard to go through this simple screening process.

Step 1: Learn in depth about the role (35 min)

Step 2: Perform a simple RLHF code review (35 min)

Step 3: Receive platform credentials, pass ID verification (5 min), and choose your project (30 min).

Step 4: Perform a production level RLHF task (75 min) ""aka the final interview""

Join us: Based on your final interview, you'll will put you on the right difficulty RLHF project

From designing our data models to implementing the subtle interaction behaviors that differentiate good software from great software. We work closely with UX Designers, Product Managers, and Data Scientists throughout the entire product process, from conception to post-launch reflection.

We are looking for a Software Engineer to join the Login & Signup (LNS) team in our Vancouver Office. The LNS team is responsible for handling the registration and authentication of Asana's users, with emphasis on secure login for enterprise accounts, such as single sign-on through Identity Providers (Okta, OneLogin, Google SSO, etc.) and multi-factor authentication. It is a full-stack team; tech stack includes TypeScript/React and some Scala.

In enterprise applications, user account management and login is a challenging, multi-faceted technical space encompassing software security, compliance to industry standards and legal regulations, large-scale IT administration needs, and quality of end-user experience. LNS' goal is to create and maintain a best-in-class registration and authentication system for Asana: we want it to be compliant with the most recent security standards and regulations, safe for enterprises to adopt, fully integrated with leading identity management frameworks, while offering the most delightful, smooth and seamless user experience.

You’ll advocate for engineering best practices and work cross-functionally to define and build powerful admin features while influencing the team's velocity. You'll mentor other engineers and advocate for code and component quality, reusability, and consistency; and you'll be at the forefront of a new wave of consumer-like experiences for the enterprise and enjoy the challenge of balancing speed of execution with quality and building a product that users love.

This role is based in Vancouver, with an office-centric hybrid schedule. The standard in-office days are Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Most Asanas have the option to work from home on Wednesdays. Working from home on Fridays depends on the type of work you do and the teams with which you partner. If you're interviewing for this role, your recruiter will share more about the in-office requirements.

What You’ll Achieve


Work in a high-performance, dynamic team with a strong focus on velocity and software quality and people's professional development
Contribute to building a complex SaaS application that is a market leader in its segment
Collaborate with Product Managers and customers to understand the needs of IT admins of large enterprises, and identify features to satisfy those needs
Partner with our Product Security team to stay updated about security threats, vulnerabilities, and cutting-edge countermeasures to protect SaaS applications
Learn about state-of-the-art technologies, including single-sign on methods and integration with Identity Providers such as Okta and Azure AD
Drive large, impactful projects, delivering features rolled out and used in large organizations


About You


Experience driving projects of medium complexity autonomously and reliably, planning tasks through milestones and workstreams, coordinating multiple engineers, and delivering successfully and on time
Interested in working in a highly technical space, learn about state of the art registration and authentication technologies, and software security
Passion for software architecture and software quality
Strong commitment to building the best UX to delight consumer and enterprise users
Continuous improvement mindset and a drive to enhance the architecture, the code, and team processes
Enthusiasm for mentoring and coaching teammates and stakeholders and contributing to team growth
Relevant experience in the tech stack (React, Typescript, Scala, SQL) as well as in UX design are nice-to-haves
Relevant industry experience in authorization and software security is a big plus; if you hold this experience, make sure to emphasize it in your application


At Asana, we're committed to building teams that include a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, as this is critical to helping us achieve our mission. If you're interested in this role and don't meet every listed requirement, we still encourage you to apply.

What We’ll Offer

We believe that compensation should be reflective of the value you create relative to the market value of your role. To ensure pay is fair and not impacted by biases, we're committed to looking at market value which is why we check ourselves and conduct a yearly pay equity audit.

For this role, the estimated base salary range is between $146,000 - $178,000 CAD. The actual base salary will vary based on various factors, including market and individual qualifications objectively assessed during the interview process. The listed range above is a guideline, and the base salary range for this role may be modified.

In addition to base salary, your compensation package may include additional components such as equity, sales incentive pay (for most sales roles), and benefits.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Come take off with us!

The yearly total compensation for this senior position ranges from $150,000 to $350,000 CAD. Compensation will be determined by candidates' relevant qualifications, knowledge, skills and work experience.
