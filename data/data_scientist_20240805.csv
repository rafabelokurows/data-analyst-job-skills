We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.


Data Science is an integral component of Coinbase’s product and decision making process: we work in partnership with Product, Engineering and Design to influence the roadmap and better understand our users. With a deep expertise in experimentation, analytics and advanced modeling, we produce insights which directly move the company’s bottom line.

What You'll Be Doing


Perform analyses on products to answer open-ended questions and provide strategic recommendations.
Design and guide experiments/analysis to measure impact and drive product improvements.
Develop and maintain key metrics and reports, enhancing data infrastructure for better analysis.


What We Look For In You


At least a BA/BS in a quantitative field (ex Math, Stats, Physics, or Computer Science) with ≥2+ years of relevant experience.
Experience driving impact for a digital product with an iterative development cycle.
Understanding of statistical concepts and practical experience applying them (in A|B testing, causal inference, ML, etc.).
Experience in data analyses using SQL.
Experience in programming/modeling in Python.
Demonstration of our core cultural values: clear communication, positive energy, continuous learning, and efficient execution.

You’ll distil insights that you share widely throughout the company, and that inform our future product direction;
You’ll build and own important datasets that quantify key aspects of our activation funnel, and you’ll mentor your team-mates on how best to use these datasets to drive impact;
You’ll monitor key metrics for our growth team, and collaborate with your team-mates to ensure we’re making good progress towards our business goals;
You’ll mentor other Data Scientists and share your deep expertise of your craft;

You’ll contribute to our overall data strategy, ensuring we remain competitive and innovative;
You’ll evangelise best practices for data and statistics, and drive adoption across the company.



Who We're Looking For


You have at least 5 years of relevant experience as a Data Scientist in a Growth team at a high-growth, product-centric technology company;
You have hands-on experience of driving a wide range growth experiments, from quick-and-scrappy “spikes” to more formal hypothesis tests;
You have at least a Bachelor’s Degree in mathematics, statistics, physics, computer science, or a related discipline (a Master’s Degree or PhD is a bonus);
You have clear experience of using data to drive business impact;
You thrive in a fast-paced, agile product development environment;
You have experience using “build-measure-learn” cycles to ship quickly, iterate and derive powerful insights;
You can work from our LA or SF office 3 days per week.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Payment Intelligence ML organization optimizes each of the billions of dollars of transactions processed by Stripe annually on behalf of our customers, maximizing successful transactions while minimizing payment costs and fraud. We leverage ML to serve real-time predictions as part of Stripe’s payment infrastructure and risk controls. We own products like Radar, Adaptive Acceptance, and Identity end-to-end, operating lightning fast world-scale services and cutting-edge ML models.

What you’ll do

We are looking for Machine Learning Engineers to own the end-to-end lifecycle of applied ML model development and deployment in service of consumer facing products like Radar, Adaptive Acceptance, and Identity. You will work closely with software engineers, machine learning engineers (MLE), data scientists (DS), and ML platform infrastructure teams to design, build, deploy, and operate Stripe’s ML-powered payment decisioning systems, including improving existing ML models and developing new ML solutions.

Responsibilities


Design and deploy new models using tools (such as Spark, Presto, XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch) and iteratively improve verification and fraud models to protect millions of users from fraud
Envision and develop new models for fraud detection i.e work with large payment datasets to find creative new methods of detecting and deterring fraudulent behavior.
Propose new feature ideas and design real-time data pipelines to incorporate them into our models.
Integrate new signals into ML pipelines, derive new ML features, and build workflows to make this process fast
Integrate new models and behaviors into Stripe’s core payment flow
Collaborate and execute projects cross-functionally with the data science, product management, infrastructure, and risk teams
Ensure engineering outcomes meet or exceed established standards of excellence in code quality, system design, and scalability
Mentor engineers earlier in their technical careers to help them grow
Propose and implement innovative product ideas to reduce costs and combat fraud at Stripe



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Over 3+ years industry experience building machine learning applications in large scale distributed systems.
2+ year of experience working within a team responsible for developing, managing, and optimizing ML models or ML infrastructure
Experience designing and training machine learning models to solve critical business problems
Experience performing analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to model performance and business metrics



Preferred Qualifications


An advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. stats, physics, computer science)
Proven track record of building and deploying machine learning systems that have effectively solved critical business problems
Experience in adversarial domains like Payments, Fraud, Trust, or Safety
Experience working in Python, Java and / or Ruby codebases
Experience in software engineering in a production environment.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $173,100 - $316,800. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Meet Your Future Neighbors

Product finance, strategy and operations (“Product FSO”) is committed to driving growth through new user acquisition and increasing engagement amongst our existing user base of neighbors. Today, we work closely with product and engineering teams to understand the impact and trends across growth and engagement while building and maintaining our quarterly and long-range forecasts. Historically, we’ve been strong in our reporting and forecasting; however, have lacked the bandwidth and capabilities to dive deeper into our data to better understand “why” we’re seeing what we’re seeing to subsequently get to “what” we should be doing about it.

We are looking for an entrepreneurial and driven Senior Operations Data Scientist to establish the foundation of our data and analytics work. You will work closely with various cross-functional teams such as product, engineering, etc. to develop a BI layer and assist us in better understanding key metrics through causal analyses, data tooling, and dashboarding. Successful candidates will exhibit technical acumen, product sense and business savvy. You are passionate about leveraging the power of data to drive product changes with quality and agility. You are a team player.

At Nextdoor, we offer a warm and inclusive work environment that embraces a hybrid employment experience, providing a flexible experience for our valued employees.

The Impact You’ll Make

Role

The work of Product FSO is essential to the growth and success of the company and involves frequent opportunities to showcase key metrics and findings to senior leadership. In this role, you will:


Partner closely with Finance and ProdDev leads to identifying strategic, high-impact analytical problems and innovative ways to solve them with data

In this role, you’ll be embedded inside a vibrant team of data scientists. You’ll be expected to help conceive, code, and deploy data science models at scale using the latest industry tools. Important skills include data wrangling, feature engineering, developing models, and testing metrics. You can expect to...

What you'll bring


Model Prototyping: The ML Engineer would be expected to build prototype models alongside data scientists. This may involve data exploration, high-performance data processing, and machine learning algorithm exploration. The ML engineer will be expected to come up with a rationale for model choice and come up with metrics to properly evaluate models.
Model Productionalization: Works with data scientists to productionalize prototype models to the point where it can be used by customers at scale. This might involve increasing the amount of data used to train the model, automation of training and prediction, and orchestration of data for continuous prediction. The engineer would be expected to understand the details of the data being used and provide metrics to compare models.
Model Enhancement: Work on existing codebases to either enhance model prediction performance or to reduce training time. In this use case you will need to understand the specifics of the algorithm implementation in order to enhance it. This enhancement could be exploratory work based off of a performance need or directed work based off of ideas that other data science team members propose.
Machine Learning Tools: The ML Engineer would build a tool for a specific project, or multiple projects though generally these types of projects are decoupled from any one project. The goal of this type of use case would be to ease a pain point in the data science process. This may involve speeding up training, making a data processing easier, or data management tooling.


Qualifications


BS, MS, or PhD degree in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent practical experience.
Knowledgeable with Data Science tools and frameworks (i.e. Python, Scikit, NLTK, Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, R, Spark).
Basic knowledge of machine learning techniques (i.e. classification, regression, and clustering).


How you will lead


Discover data sources, get access to them, import them, clean them up, and make them “machine learning ready”.
Work with data scientists to create and refine features from the underlying data and build pipelines to train and deploy models.
Partner with data scientists to understand, implement, refine and design machine learning and other algorithms.
Run regular A/B tests, gather data, perform statistical analysis, draw conclusions on the impact of your models.
Work cross functionally with product managers, data scientists and product engineers, and communicate results to peers and leaders.
Explore new technology shifts in order to determine how they might connect with the customer benefits we wish to deliver.

Please attach all the documents asked.




About the project

On the battlefield, injured soldiers can face significant delays in medical treatment or evacuation due to ongoing hostilities and treacherous terrain. Traditional methods of casualty care rely on limited information and may put medics at unnecessary risk: medics often lack a comprehensive picture of the battlefield, hindering their ability to locate and prioritise casualties while minimising exposure to threats. The TaMaCare project emerges from this critical observation, aiming to revolutionise battlefield casualty care by creating a real-time digital twin of the frontline. More precisely, we aim to improve response times and decision-making in critical situations. The proposed digital twin aims to provide medics with a clear view of the battlefield, encompassing the location of injured soldiers, their vital signs, and any structures or potential dangers present in the vicinity.




Expected results

The impact of TaMaCare on battlefield casualty care is multifaceted and far-reaching:

Faster and better decision making: TaMaCare will create a digital twin of the battlefield for use by the rear echelon and decision makers, allowing faster response times and improved decision-making. The digital twin will provide real-time information of the environment, casualty location and their health status, allowing medics to make informed decisions about treatment priorities and evacuation routes, considering factors like urgency, (environmental) hazards, and resource availability. The detailed 3D map, including casualties and threats, can also be used to plan optimal evacuation routes, taking into account terrain, obstacles, and the physical condition of casualties.
Reduced risk for soldiers and medics: The digital twin will be created using unmanned systems, i.e. without putting soldiers in harm’s way. By providing a clear picture of potential threats, TaMaCare allows medics to navigate the battlefield with greater awareness and minimise their exposure to danger.
Post-action analysis: The digital twin allows for an after action analysis of the decision and actions that were made, allowing to draw lessons for future interventions.

The benefits of TaMaCare extend beyond immediate casualty care and contribute to a broader strengthening of defence capabilities. In fact, the project fosters advancements in 3D mapping, threat detection/assessment through image processing, and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) localization networks. These advancements have broader applications for military and civilian operations and for intelligence gathering: planning for offensive/defensive operations, re-assessment of the geometrical environment after man-made or natural calamities, improved navigation of unmanned vehicles, removal of UXO/IED (Unexploded Ordnance/Improvised Explosive Devices), etc.




Your role

The research in TaMaCare will be performed by a Belgian consortium. The role of the researcher hired for this job offer will focus on the development of AI models and ML techniques to facilitate, automate and simplify detection of threats on the battlefield using electromagnetic (panchromatic, multispectral or hyperspectral) sensors in the visible and infrared spectrum based on their spatial or spatio-spectral signature. This knowledge will also be applied to other projects within RMA with similar needs.

          <p><strong>APPLICATION BY EMAIL according to the application rules hereunder (not via LinkedIn). Please attach all the documents asked.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>About the project</strong></p><p>On the battlefield, injured soldiers can face significant delays in medical treatment or evacuation due to ongoing hostilities and treacherous terrain. Traditional methods of casualty care rely on limited information and may put medics at unnecessary risk: medics often lack a comprehensive picture of the battlefield, hindering their ability to locate and prioritise casualties while minimising exposure to threats. The TaMaCare project emerges from this critical observation, aiming to revolutionise battlefield casualty care by creating a real-time digital twin of the frontline. More precisely, we aim to improve response times and decision-making in critical situations. The proposed digital twin aims to provide medics with a clear view of the battlefield, encompassing the location of injured soldiers, their vital signs, and any structures or potential dangers present in the vicinity.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Expected results</strong></p><p>The impact of TaMaCare on battlefield casualty care is multifaceted and far-reaching:</p><ul><li>Faster and better decision making: TaMaCare will create a digital twin of the battlefield for use by the rear echelon and decision makers, allowing faster response times and improved decision-making. The digital twin will provide real-time information of the environment, casualty location and their health status, allowing medics to make informed decisions about treatment priorities and evacuation routes, considering factors like urgency, (environmental) hazards, and resource availability. The detailed 3D map, including casualties and threats, can also be used to plan optimal evacuation routes, taking into account terrain, obstacles, and the physical condition of casualties.</li><li>Reduced risk for soldiers and medics: The digital twin will be created using unmanned systems, i.e. without putting soldiers in harm’s way. By providing a clear picture of potential threats, TaMaCare allows medics to navigate the battlefield with greater awareness and minimise their exposure to danger.</li><li>Post-action analysis: The digital twin allows for an after action analysis of the decision and actions that were made, allowing to draw lessons for future interventions.</li></ul><p>The benefits of TaMaCare extend beyond immediate casualty care and contribute to a broader strengthening of defence capabilities. In fact, the project fosters advancements in 3D mapping, threat detection/assessment through image processing, and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) localization networks. These advancements have broader applications for military and civilian operations and for intelligence gathering: planning for offensive/defensive operations, re-assessment of the geometrical environment after man-made or natural calamities, improved navigation of unmanned vehicles, removal of UXO/IED (Unexploded Ordnance/Improvised Explosive Devices), etc.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Your role</strong></p><p>The research in TaMaCare will be performed by a Belgian consortium. The role of the researcher hired for this job offer will focus on the development of AI models and ML techniques to facilitate, automate and simplify detection of threats on the battlefield using electromagnetic (panchromatic, multispectral or hyperspectral) sensors in the visible and infrared spectrum based on their spatial or spatio-spectral signature. This knowledge will also be applied to other projects within RMA with similar needs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Required skills</strong></p><p>Technical skills</p><p>The applicant shall have a Master Degree in Engineering Science, Applied Sciences, Civil Engineering, Physics, Computer Science or Mathematics.</p><ul><li>Training or experience in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and/or Deep Learning is essential;</li><li>Experience in programming with C++ or Python is essential;</li><li>Experience with OpenCV, PyTorch or Tensorflow is highly recommended;</li><li>Experience with Computer Vision is highly recommended;</li><li>Experience with the Robotic Operating System (ROS) or Linux is recommended;</li><li>Training or experience in multi- or hyperspectral imaging or other EO technologies is an added value;</li><li>Training or experience in processing of large scale data is an added value;</li><li>Training or experience in agile workflow methodologies is an added value;</li><li>Training or experience in applied, collaborative research is an added value;</li></ul><p><strong>Other skills</strong></p><ul><li>The applicant shall have very good knowledge of English (oral / written).</li><li>The applicant shall preferably have knowledge of either French or Dutch and a minimum knowledge of the other language in order to allow collaboration with peers. This will be tested during the selection process.</li></ul><p><strong>Specific requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Interest in starting a PhD is an added value.</li><li>The researcher may be exposed to classified information and will therefore have to obtain the required security clearance. The candidate must consent with the background check required to obtain this clearance, which will be executed by the Belgian Defence.</li><li>A driver’s licence valid in Belgium is an added value.</li><li>Working for the Patrimony requires living in Belgium for the duration of the study.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Application</strong></p><p>You will be working in a military environment. That is why everyone is expected to undergo a security verification. A passport issued by a country that is both member of the EU and NATO is required.
