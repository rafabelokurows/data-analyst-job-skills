About the New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt, the best place to order groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, and other retail goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!) 🚀

About The New Verticals Analytics Team

Our New Verticals Analytics team sits at the intersection of product development, strategic planning, and operational execution. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design, and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions, to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience that combines scientific expertise with stakeholder engagement. When you join this team, you will be taking ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from the ground up, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we want you on our team.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
4+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis using statistical software packages in Python or R.
Expertise in causal inference (Diff in Diff, Synthetic control).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Within our team of experts on large-scale machine learning and data handling, you will work on improving, benchmarking and extending our family of best-in-class foundations models, bridging image, text and other pathology data modalities. Moreover, using our foundation models you will contribute to developing prototypes for new applications to assist pathologists and generate new insights for improving cancer treatment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

A dedicated, supportive and growing team




A corporate culture that combines excellence with team spirit

At FGS Global, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. So, if you’re excited about this role and our company but your previous professional experience doesn’t match perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we would like to encourage you to apply anyway.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That’s where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $20M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Senior Data Scientist in Aignostic's foundation model team you will work on our self-supervised base models. Together with collaborators in academia and industry you will push the state of the art in large-scale machine learning for digital pathology. Within our team of experts on large-scale machine learning and data handling, you will work on improving, benchmarking and extending our family of best-in-class foundations models, bridging image, text and other pathology data modalities. Moreover, using our foundation models you will contribute to developing prototypes for new applications to assist pathologists and generate new insights for improving cancer treatment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Du arbeitest für unsere Customer IT

Unsere Customer IT entwickelt und betreibt in enger Kooperation mit Fachabteilungen spezialisierte IT-Lösungen, die unsere mehr als 5 Millionen nationalen Endverbraucher unterstützen, die Effizienz unserer Service Partner im Call Center Betrieb sicherstellen und unsere regulatorischen Marktaufgaben ermöglichen. Die Customer-IT ist dabei in Deutschland auf sechs Teams mit Kolleg:innen sowohl in Hamburg als auch in Berlin aufgeteilt.

Nach einer Vielzahl erfolgreicher Piloten und dem produktiven Massenroll-Out ambitionierter BI/AI/ML Services ist die Entscheidung gefallen, unser lokales „Customer Analytics“ Team dramatisch zu stärken!

Wir ermöglichen Dir, die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette abzudecken: von der Anbindung unterschiedlicher Datenquellen (ETL) bis zur Entwicklung komplexer Abfrage- und Analyseroutinen sowie der Umsetzung zielgruppengerechter Visualisierungslösungen; Du machst den Unterschied!

Neben Deiner Technologie- und Lösungskompetenz überzeugt dabei Dein ganzheitlicher Beratungsansatz. Du trägst mit dazu bei, dass Vattenfall seine führende Position auf dem deutschen Energiemarkt festigt, die fossil-freie Energiewende Wirklichkeit wird und unsere Business Prozesse skalierbar, digital, daten-getrieben und durchgehend kundenorientiert ablaufen.

Über uns

Die Smartbroker-Gruppe betreibt unter anderem den Smartbroker+ – einen mehrfach ausgezeichneten Online-Broker, der als einziger Anbieter in Deutschland das umfangreiche Produktspektrum der klassischen Broker mit den äußerst günstigen Konditionen der Neobroker verbindet. Zum Portfolio gehört außerdem der digitale Fondsvermittler SMARTBROKER Finance (vormals: FondsDISCOUNT.de), gleichzeitig betreibt die Gruppe vier reichweitenstarke Börsenportale (wallstreet-online.de, boersenNews.de, FinanzNachrichten.de und ARIVA.de). Mit mehreren Hundert Millionen monatlichen Seitenaufrufen ist die Gruppe der größte verlagsunabhängige Finanzportalbetreiber im deutschsprachigen Raum und unterhält außerdem die größte Finanz-Community.

Das Unternehmen gehört zu den Pionieren des digitalen Investments. Seit mehr als 25 Jahren setzen wir uns dafür ein, die Hürden bei der Geldanlage abzubauen und eine nutzerfreundliche und preisgünstige Abwicklung von Investments zu ermöglichen.

Der Schlüssel zu diesem Erfolg sind unsere Mitarbeiter:innen. Aufgrund der starken Wachstumsdynamik haben wir in den vergangenen Jahren zahlreiche attraktive Arbeitsplätze geschaffen. Jeden Tag streben wir danach, das beste Team aufzubauen und unseren Mitarbeiter:innen den Raum zu geben, sich selbst bestmöglich zu entwickeln. Ein vielfältiges Team aus Leistungsträgern sorgt dafür, dass wir alle jeden Tag dazulernen. Aus einem kleinen Team mit ca. 20 Personen sind wir inzwischen ein Unternehmen mit rund 260 Mitarbeiter:innen (Stand 31.12.2023) geworden, das in einem modernen Büro in Berlin-Kreuzberg sitzt.

Wir verstehen uns als innovatives Fintech, das in eine erfolgreiche Unternehmensgruppe eingebettet ist und damit persönliche Arbeitsatmosphäre mit den Vorteilen einer finanzstarken Aktiengesellschaft verbindet. In allen Unternehmensteilen setzen wir auf flache Hierarchien, individuelle Entwicklung und agile Prozesse. Wir sind stolz auf den persönlichen Zusammenhalt im Team und die überdurchschnittlich lange Betriebszugehörigkeit vieler Angestellter. Wir setzen uns für Vielfalt und Chancengleichheit ein. Wir streben danach, ein Team aufzubauen, das eine Vielzahl von Hintergründen, Perspektiven und Fähigkeiten repräsentiert. Je integrativer wir sind, desto besser wird unsere Arbeit und unser Team sein.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.

Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is to maximise business impact within one of many business areas. You will help answer questions like:



Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?



The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Requirements



A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)
Experience conducting A/B experiments
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems



Why Deliveroo

Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.

We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

Workplace & Benefits

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed.

A major contributor to why people stay in their jobs is they have (and can clearly see / measure) a direct impact on their business.




Without it people can often feel lost.




In this role as a Data Scientist, everything you do is measurable. A lot of what you do is focused around optimisation so you can clearly see the impact you can have on the business (one model on a previous project saved £5m last year!).

This role is that of a Lead; you are tried and tested, and can act as the right-hand person to the manager to bounce ideas off. You’ll have one direct report to look after and mentor and report into the Head of Data Science. You’re all about optimisation and probably have a solid background in Causal Modelling & Uplift Modelling.




Ideal background

Several years as a Data Scientist to allow both team and independent work

Causal Modelling & Uplift Modelling techniques are your bread & butter
AirFlow (or other Orchestration tools)

A major contributor to why people stay in their jobs is they have (and can clearly see / measure) a direct impact on their business.




Without it people can often feel lost.




In this role as a Data Scientist, everything you do is measurable. A lot of what you do is focused around optimisation so you can clearly see the impact you can have on the business (one model on a previous project saved £5m last year!).




That meaning is a lot, but with a very impressive 40% bonus which is partly influenced by things like that, you can have a financial impact on yourself too!




This role is that of a Lead; you are tried and tested, and can act as the right-hand person to the manager to bounce ideas off. You’ll have one direct report to look after and mentor and report into the Head of Data Science. You’re all about optimisation and probably have a solid background in Causal Modelling & Uplift Modelling.




Ideal background

Several years as a Data Scientist to allow both team and independent work
Excellent stakeholder management & communication – its technical AND people focussed
Causal Modelling & Uplift Modelling techniques are your bread & butter
AirFlow (or other Orchestration tools)




Salary is up to £110,000 + 40% bonus, 3 days WFH, flexible hours, 25 days holiday, Private pension and 6% matched pension.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is a global management consulting firm and the world’s leading advisor on business strategy. We partner with clients from the private, public, and not-for-profit sectors in all regions to identify their highest-value opportunities, address their most critical challenges, and transform their enterprises. Our customized approach combines deep insight into the dynamics of companies and markets with close collaboration at all levels of the client organization. This ensures that our clients achieve sustainable competitive advantage, build more capable organizations, and secure lasting results. Founded in 1963, BCG is a private company with offices in more than 90 cities in 50 countries. For more information, please visit bcg.com.

BCG’s clients are the world’s top business leaders. From computers to retailing, our professional expertise spans over 50 industries. The vast majority of our clients rank among the 500 largest companies in each of our three major regions–Americas (North and South), Europe Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Additionally, we work with a number of small- to medium-sized companies, both public and private.

The success of our assignments routinely leads our clients to maintain long-term relationships with us. Over 85 percent of our revenues come from clients who continue to work with us from one year to the next to maintain the momentum for change and to continually improve bottom-line results they have achieved with our help.

We pride ourselves on our fresh thinking. Our evolving ideas profoundly change the way most businesses think about competition. Many leading business concepts over the past three decades originated with BCG–including, experience curve, time-based competition, Segment-of-One® marketing, deconstruction, and trading up. Our recent Collateral Damage publication series has addressed the implications for managers of the on-going financial crisis.

We believe that no other consulting organization has concentrated as thoroughly on understanding business competition and helping companies make the changes necessary to succeed in increasingly competitive markets.

La réputation mondiale du cabinet de conseil en gestion Boston Consulting Group (BCG), comme l'un des meilleurs en gestion, découle de plus de cinquante années d'expérience à aider les cadres supérieurs à découvrir et réaliser tout le potentiel de leur entreprise. Notre mission consiste à appuyer nos clients à réaliser des avantages concurrentiels durables en offrant des solutions personnalisées. Nous croyons fermement qu'il faut travailler avec nos clients, pas à leurs dépens. Nous collaborons avec chaque client pour l'aider à prendre une direction et à faire face aux défis organisationnels et opérationnels.

Fondé en 1963, BCG compte maintenant plus de 11,000 experts-conseils, et ce, dans plus de 90 bureaux dans le monde entier. Les clients du BCG sont les dirigeants des plus importantes entreprises du monde. Des ordinateurs jusqu'à la vente au détail, notre expertise professionnelle s'étend à plus de 50 industries. La grande majorité de nos clients figurent parmi les 500 plus grandes entreprises dans chacune de nos trois régions principales – Les Amériques (nord et sud), l'Europe (incluant le Moyen-Orient et l'Afrique) et l'Asie-Pacifique. De plus, nous travaillons avec un certain nombre de petites et moyennes entreprises, tant publiques que privées.

Notre succès, provenant des mandats qui nous sont assignés, nous permet d'établir des relations à long terme avec nos clients. Plus de 85 pourcents de nos revenus proviennent de clients qui continuent à travailler avec nous d'une année à l'autre pour conserver l'élan de changement et pour améliorer continuellement les résultats nets qu'ils ont réalisés grâce à notre aide.

Nous sommes fiers de notre approche innovatrice. Nos idées évolutives changent profondément la manière dont la plupart des entreprises considèrent la concurrence. Plusieurs des principaux concepts d'affaires, au cours des trois dernières décennies, ont commencé avec BCG, y compris la courbe d'apprentissage, la concurrence calculée sur le temps, le marketing Segment-of-One®, le démantèlement et l'extension ascendante. Nos récentes publications de la série Collateral Damage ont traité de l'implication des dirigeants face à la crise financière en cours.

Nous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe is the best software platform for running an internet business. We handle billions of dollars every year for hundreds of thousands of businesses around the world. One third of Americans bought something on Stripe in the last year.

With all this data, the Growth Data Engineering team is looking for talented data-minded engineers to help us manage business critical data leveraged across the entire organization. If you are passionate about data, excited about designing data pipelines and data-driven user experiences, and motivated by having an outsized impact on the business, we want to hear from you.

What you’ll do

Every record in our data warehouse is vitally important for the businesses that use Stripe, so we’re looking for people with a strong background in data engineering and analytics to help us scale while maintaining correct and complete data. You’ll be working with a variety of internal teams across Growth, Sales, Marketing, and Data Science to help them solve their data needs. Your work will provide teams with visibility into how Stripe’s Growth organization is performing and how we can deliver a better experience to Stripe's customers.

Responsibilities


Identify data needs for Growth, Sales, and Marketing teams, understand their specific operational and reporting requirements, and build efficient and scalable data products & pipelines to enable data-driven decisions across Stripe
Design, develop, and own data pipelines, models, and products that power Stripe’s Growth, Sales, and Marketing teams
Help the Data Science team apply and generalize statistical and econometric models on large datasets to empower more intelligent decision making among our Growth & Go-to-Market teams
Develop strong subject matter expertise and manage the SLAs for both data pipelines and full stack web applications that support the Growth & Go-to-Market organizations at Stripe
Build Stripe's Customer Engagement Data Service - collecting, curating, mastering, enriching, and presenting a single view of user interactions with Stripe for consumption by data applications across the company
Build and refine Stripe's data foundations - infrastructure, pipelines, and tools to enable Growth, Sales, and Marketing teams at Stripe - working with Scala, Spark, and Airflow
Design and build client libraries and frameworks to log events and accurately track the behavior of users interacting with our logged-out user interfaces such as Stripe.com
Refine our existing data marts that help the Sales and Marketing organization at Stripe forecast the future potential performance of the business, and reliably measure their ongoing attainment toward targets
Build data pipelines that track key GTM product metrics, and measure the impact of different GTM strategies employed by teams in the field
Integrate different parts of our experimentation infrastructure at Stripe, to enable full-funnel measurement and personalization of experiences spanning from Stripe.com into product
Our stack spans tools in Spark, Scala, Python, SQL, Presto, Airflow, AWS, Java, Go, and React



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3+ years of experience in a Data Engineering or Software Engineering role, with a focus on building data pipelines, or applications powered by big data.
A strong engineering background and are interested in data
Prior experience with writing and debugging data pipelines using a distributed data framework (Spark / Hadoop / Pig etc)
An inquisitive nature in diving into data inconsistencies to pinpoint issues, and resolve deep rooted data quality issues
Knowledge of a scientific computing language (such as Scala or Python) and SQL
Experience with full stack development languages such as Java or Go, and front-end frameworks such as React
The ability to communicate cross-functionally, derive requirements and architect shared datasets



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $136,800 - $244,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

We oversee Accounts and Connect APIs and dashboard surfaces that Stripe users rely on to run their business.

As part of revamping our Accounts Platform for the next decade plus, we have the opportunity to solve challenging user pain points at scale and build a granular, expressive framework powering users’ onboarding experience as well as that of their own end users. As part of revamping our Platform Abstractions, we have an opportunity to provide flexibility to our users in terms of their economic model, funds flows, and how they integrate their business with Stripe.

A strong foundation of customizable account structures and interoperable APIs is critical to Stripe’s long-term success. It’s important we get the set of core business blocks right – that we understand how businesses of all sizes model their organizational structures and think about their relationships, and we ensure that integrating with Stripe is nothing short of a fantastic experience. We are applying Stripe’s developer-centric approach to building a flexible, programmable representation of humans, businesses, and money that maps across all Stripe products.

What you'll do

Engineers on the team will design and build end-to-end features for Stripe’s Accounts and Connect APIs. This includes features for Stripe’s largest users with complex integrations, as well as new users, solopreneurs, and startups. We are seeking engineers who are excited to develop features for these foundations as well as their API and UI representations, delivering best-in-class product experiences for our users.

Responsibilities


Build beautiful end-to-end user experiences as well as high-performance APIs that power them
Ensure our infrastructure is extensible, scalable, and reliable for both internal and external users
Collaborate with cross-functional partner teams to deliver delightful developer experiences and comprehensive interfaces with core account and money movement primitives
Reduce complexity for our users via simple yet powerful abstractions



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Strong technical background, including 4+ years of experience as a full stack engineer, with an affinity for building scalable backend infrastructure.
Experience delivering, extending, and maintaining large scale distributed systems.
Empathetic, collaborative, and user-first mindset in everything you build
Interest in working as a generalist across varying technologies and stacks to solve problems and delight both internal and external users
Ability to stitch together many different services together even if you have not worked with them before
Preference for simple solutions and designs over complex ones, and having a good intuition for what is lasting and scalable
The skills to build holistically – from specs and documentation to implementation, testing, deployment, and measuring impact
Ability to work well cross-functionally and earn trust from colleagues at all levels
Experience mentoring and growing junior engineers as their technical leader



Preferred Qualifications


Junior and fellow senior engineers feel they are able to learn from you, and you care deeply about mentoring others
Propensity to ask questions, assume good intentions, and defaulting to transparency
You are often cited as the inspiration for engineers that join your team



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

          Who we are<br><br><strong>About Stripe<br><br></strong>Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.<br><br><strong>About The Team<br><br></strong>We oversee Accounts and Connect APIs and dashboard surfaces that Stripe users rely on to run their business.<br><br>As part of revamping our Accounts Platform for the next decade plus, we have the opportunity to solve challenging user pain points at scale and build a granular, expressive framework powering users’ onboarding experience as well as that of their own end users. As part of revamping our Platform Abstractions, we have an opportunity to provide flexibility to our users in terms of their economic model, funds flows, and how they integrate their business with Stripe.<br><br>A strong foundation of customizable account structures and interoperable APIs is critical to Stripe’s long-term success. It’s important we get the set of core business blocks right – that we understand how businesses of all sizes model their organizational structures and think about their relationships, and we ensure that integrating with Stripe is nothing short of a fantastic experience. We are applying Stripe’s developer-centric approach to building a flexible, programmable representation of humans, businesses, and money that maps across all Stripe products.<br><br>What you'll do<br><br>Engineers on the team will design and build end-to-end features for Stripe’s Accounts and Connect APIs. This includes features for Stripe’s largest users with complex integrations, as well as new users, solopreneurs, and startups. We are seeking engineers who are excited to develop features for these foundations as well as their API and UI representations, delivering best-in-class product experiences for our users.<br><br><strong>Responsibilities<br><br></strong><ul><li>Build beautiful end-to-end user experiences as well as high-performance APIs that power them </li><li>Ensure our infrastructure is extensible, scalable, and reliable for both internal and external users</li><li>Collaborate with cross-functional partner teams to deliver delightful developer experiences and comprehensive interfaces with core account and money movement primitives</li><li>Reduce complexity for our users via simple yet powerful abstractions<br><br><br></li></ul>Who you are<br><br>We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.<br><br><strong>Minimum Requirements<br><br></strong><ul><li>Strong technical background, including 4+ years of experience as a full stack engineer, with an affinity for building scalable backend infrastructure.</li><li>Experience delivering, extending, and maintaining large scale distributed systems.</li><li>Empathetic, collaborative, and user-first mindset in everything you build</li><li>Interest in working as a generalist across varying technologies and stacks to solve problems and delight both internal and external users</li><li>Ability to stitch together many different services together even if you have not worked with them before</li><li>Preference for simple solutions and designs over complex ones, and having a good intuition for what is lasting and scalable</li><li>The skills to build holistically – from specs and documentation to implementation, testing, deployment, and measuring impact</li><li>Ability to work well cross-functionally and earn trust from colleagues at all levels</li><li>Experience mentoring and growing junior engineers as their technical leader<br><br><br></li></ul><strong>Preferred Qualifications<br><br></strong><ul><li>Junior and fellow senior engineers feel they are able to learn from you, and you care deeply about mentoring others</li><li>Propensity to ask questions, assume good intentions, and defaulting to transparency</li><li>You are often cited as the inspiration for engineers that join your team<br><br><br></li></ul>Hybrid work at Stripe<br><br>This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).<br><br>Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.<br><br>A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.<br><br>Pay and benefits<br><br>The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$134,400 - C$201,600.

You can squish bugs like a crazed entomologist. And your design solutions are more elegant than an Italian countess. 

If that sounds like you AND you love a fun, collaborative workday where you get to help gazillions of people transform their lives; let's talk! 

AlgaeCal is looking for an Intermediate Front End Developer to bring their wizardry to our fun-loving Dev team.

Small print here ⇒ We're an eCommerce company. So, we want you to have eCommerce experience. Lots of it. So if you don't love digital marketing the way Elon loves Elon, you probably shouldn't read any further. 

Still here? Okay then...

This job will give you ALL the feels:

At AlgaeCal, we're driven by a single idea. To end the fear of bone loss. In the United States, an estimated 54 million people have low bone density. 

The good news? AlgaeCal has the world's only clinically-backed natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you'll find no better place to continue your career than at AlgaeCal. 

You'll love it here:

You'll be working with a great team. The developers at AlgaeCal have been there, done that, and got the t-shirt. They've written more code than Alan Turing. They've learned more programming languages than C3PO. They've immersed themselves in so many development tasks that they've had to be pulled out of the Matrix by their ankles on a Friday evening. And the best part? They're friendly, funny, and easy to work with.
You'll use your powers for good. This isn't one of those jobs that crush your soul with mindless tasks. On the contrary! You'll be working on a wide range of applications that helps spread a powerful message - bone loss is beatable. 
You won't be micromanaged. We'll give you a simple set of KPIs with crystal clear expectations.
We don't have mattresses at the office (Seriously Elon, what's up with that?!?). You'll be relieved to know this isn't one of those Silicon Valley gigs that expects you to work ridiculously long hours and frowns upon family time. We're not like that! We enjoy our life, and we want you to enjoy yours too. 

This job might be for you if you've got...

A resume that wows us. We expect you'll have proven front-end web development skills.
2+ years of experience in a software development role would be preferred. You'll be able to provide us with examples of your work in a wide variety of coding niches.
An encyclopedic knowledge of Semantic HTML, Javascript (> ES 2016), CSS & Sass. 
We'd also love you to have worked with jQuery, Handlebars.js, Liquid, React, and Vue.
A yoda-like ability to develop and deploy features for our WordPress blog and website templates.
A portfolio that demonstrates your mastery of all-things dev. Sorry, but if you have to Google ‘Bitbucket'; or you've never heard of ‘AWS', this isn't the position for you. 
Next level bug resolving skills. In fact, you're so good at dealing with bugs you should probably be deployed on a mission to Klendathu.


If you're reading this and thinking, ""Wow, that sounds exactly like me!"" We would love to hear from you. If it doesn't, no worries! We're only seeking candidates who will immediately light up this role. 

What Will You Earn? 

Our Intermediate Front End Developer position starts at $70,000 and can go up to $85,000 depending on your experience. If your salary expectations differ from this range, let us know! 

Other Goodies

A generous healthcare package
Monthly team events and activities
Flexible Stat Holidays with the option to bank days for later use
Weekly team lunches
Hybrid work environment (we work from home 2 days a week)
Casual dress code
Incredible dog friendly, Yaletown office one block from SkyTrain
Professional Development: You'll get the opportunity to attend professional development conferences or workshops that will enhance your skills, expand your network, and drive your career forward with our support! And of course, we'll cover your fees, accommodation, travel, meals, and any related materials or resources.  

And above all, you'll join a team that you'll never want to leave. Culture is everything to us. Yes, we work extremely hard to change as many people's lives as possible. But we know how to have fun and reward ourselves too.

We build machine learning services and data pipelines to automatically extract insights about competitors from both public and internal data sources. Every day, our services process millions of data points, including news articles, press releases, webpage changes, Slack posts, emails, reviews, CRM opportunities, and user actions. We utilize a broad array of ML techniques, including classification, clustering, recommendation, summarization, prompt engineering, vector search, and retrieval augmented generation.

💡Klue + You?

Q: Klue who?

A: We’re Klue and from a technical perspective, Klue’s mission is to descale huge amounts of data to the human level, so people can process it and make use of it. Klue is that trusted intermediary, right now it’s proven for sales enablement, but tomorrow it’s all teams enablement.

Q: What level of experience are we looking for?

A: Right now, we are looking for experienced senior-level Machine Learning Engineers.

Q: What are we working on?

A: Services for collecting, processing and generating timely, relevant intel that is accurately linked to competitors, products, industries, and people. Our Machine Learning Engineers are primarily focused on the training, evaluation, and deployment of models to label, score, cluster, and generate insights.

Q: What technologies do we use?

A: Python, Transformers, Pytorch, Hugging Face, Spacy, Sklearn, Pinecone, Kubeflow, Vertex AI, BentoML, Aporia, JS, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, GCP, BigQuery, Docker/Kubernetes, Github, GPT.

We believe in using whatever tools make sense to get the job done and support our game-changing innovation.

Q: What skills do you bring?


A: You are an expert on the landscape of transformer models and are proficient with popular ML frameworks such as PyTorch, Hugging Face, or Scikit-Learn.
You stay up to date on recent advances with LLMs and you demonstrate astute judgment in deciding whether to train a model with a custom architecture or leverage GPT.
You ensure your experiments are reproducible, balancing swift discovery with scientific rigor.
You are proficient in designing, implementing, and deploying RESTful APIs and you have experience with (non)relational and vector databases.
You demonstrate good judgment when making architectural decisions and you understand how those decisions fit into the bigger picture.


Q: How do teams work?


Hybrid. Best of both worlds (remote & in-office)
Our main Canadian hubs are in Vancouver and Toronto, and most of our teams are located in EST and PST.
You and your team will be in office at least 2 days per week.


Q: What about total compensation & benefits?


Benefits. We currently have extended health benefits starting on your 1st day.
Time off. Take what you need. We want the team to prioritize wellness and avoid burnout. Vacation usually falls into 3 categories: recharging, life-event, & keeping a work-life balance. Just ensure the required work gets done and clear it with your team in advance. You need to take at least two weeks off every year. The average Klue team member takes 2-4 weeks of PTO per year.


⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️

Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew. During the interview process, please let us know if there is anything we need to make more accessible or accommodate to support you to be successful.

All interviews will be conducted via video calls. We work in a hybrid model of WFH (remote) and in-office. We’re excited to meet you and in the meantime, get to know us:

It does not matter which programming language is your primary and we accept engineers with Python (however, you must be willing to work using Swift). Previous Swift experience is not required.

Accepted Locations

We are accepting applicants from the US, Canada, and most countries in LATAM and Europe. We are accepting some countries in Africa and Asia. For the full list of accepted locations, click here. This work is 100% remote.

Loom Video

Our Founder/CEO, Gabe Greenberg, created a more in depth Loom video that we highly recommend you watch! Check it out here: https://www.loom.com/share/5a8972c7fbbf46aaa3f389b2b6391c40

Job Overview

We are currently seeking Developers for project-specific roles focused on RLHF. This role will play a key part in our reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) initiatives, contributing to cutting-edge projects.

You’ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for for the worlds most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the biggest players in the AI/LLM space today. We are seeking software engineers with 4+ years of experience to train AI large language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!

What Will I Be Doing?


Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""which piece of Python code is better?"" to ""make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterwards to make it faster""


Contract Length


This project is expected to last until the end of September and you'll be able to continue to work on other projects (though likely not in Swift).
You can end the contract at any time.


Flexible Schedules


Developers can set their own hours - ideal candidates will be interested in spending 15+ hours a week. They will be with teams, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but incredibly flexible on working hours.
Take a 3 hour lunch, no problem. You are paid according to time spent on the platform, which is calculated in the coding exercises, as opposed to tracking your own hours.


Compensation


US: $50 /hr
Brazil: $28.70/hr
Egypt: $22.05/hr
Phillipines: $25.55/hr
All other countries: $35/hr
Expectations are 15+ hours per week however there is no upper limit. We have engineers working 20-40 hrs per week and some that are working 40+ hours per week. You can work as much as you want to. You'll get paid on a weekly basis. You get paid per hour of work done on the platform.


Interview Process

We've created a 3.5 hour screening and onboarding process to join as a Software Engineer for AI Training Data which can be accomplished in 1 week or less. We purposely perform most of these steps asynchronously because most of the RLHF work is async and self guided. After you apply, if you look like a good fit we'll provide you access to the G2i dashboard to go through this simple screening process.

Step 1: Learn in depth about the role (35 min)

Step 2: Perform a simple RLHF code review (35 min)

Step 3: Receive platform credentials, pass ID verification (5 min), and choose your project (30 min).

Step 4: Perform a production level RLHF task (75 min) ""aka the final interview""

Join us: Based on your final interview, you'll will put you on the right difficulty RLHF project

It does not matter which programming language is your primary and we accept engineers with Python (however, you must be willing to work using Swift). Previous Swift experience is not required.

Accepted Locations

We are accepting applicants from the US, Canada, and most countries in LATAM and Europe. We are accepting some countries in Africa and Asia. For the full list of accepted locations, click here. This work is 100% remote.

Loom Video

Our Founder/CEO, Gabe Greenberg, created a more in depth Loom video that we highly recommend you watch! Check it out here: https://www.loom.com/share/5a8972c7fbbf46aaa3f389b2b6391c40

Job Overview

We are currently seeking Developers for project-specific roles focused on RLHF. This role will play a key part in our reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) initiatives, contributing to cutting-edge projects.

You’ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for for the worlds most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the biggest players in the AI/LLM space today. We are seeking software engineers with 4+ years of experience to train AI large language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!

What Will I Be Doing?


Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""which piece of Python code is better?"" to ""make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterwards to make it faster""


Contract Length


This project is expected to last until the end of September and you'll be able to continue to work on other projects (though likely not in Swift).
You can end the contract at any time.


Flexible Schedules


Developers can set their own hours - ideal candidates will be interested in spending 15+ hours a week. They will be with teams, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but incredibly flexible on working hours.
Take a 3 hour lunch, no problem. You are paid according to time spent on the platform, which is calculated in the coding exercises, as opposed to tracking your own hours.


Compensation


US: $50 /hr
Brazil: $28.70/hr
Egypt: $22.05/hr
Phillipines: $25.55/hr
All other countries: $35/hr
Expectations are 15+ hours per week however there is no upper limit. We have engineers working 20-40 hrs per week and some that are working 40+ hours per week. You can work as much as you want to. You'll get paid on a weekly basis. You get paid per hour of work done on the platform.


Interview Process

We've created a 3.5 hour screening and onboarding process to join as a Software Engineer for AI Training Data which can be accomplished in 1 week or less. We purposely perform most of these steps asynchronously because most of the RLHF work is async and self guided. After you apply, if you look like a good fit we'll provide you access to the G2i dashboard to go through this simple screening process.

Step 1: Learn in depth about the role (35 min)

Step 2: Perform a simple RLHF code review (35 min)

Step 3: Receive platform credentials, pass ID verification (5 min), and choose your project (30 min).

Step 4: Perform a production level RLHF task (75 min) ""aka the final interview""

Join us: Based on your final interview, you'll will put you on the right difficulty RLHF project
