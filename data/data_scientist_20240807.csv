With an arsenal of awesome products that span spending, saving, travel, transfers, investing, exchanging and more, we've helped 40+ million customers get more from their money.

We want brilliant people that love building great products, love redefining success, and love turning the complexity of a chaotic world into the simplicity of a beautiful solution.
About The Role
Our Technology team isn’t just one of the best in the industry. It's one of the best in the world. And we’re proud of it. It’s our driving force — our engine 🚀
From building a new financial backend to creating an award-winning app, there’s nothing (and we mean nothing) our tech team can’t do.
Our Technology team isn’t here to fix legacy systems — it’s here to build world-class financial products from the ground up.
We’re looking for a Python Backend Engineer to join our Revolut People team. Revolut People is a brand new product from Revolut, a one-stop shop for all people needs, from performance and recruitment to HR. It enables companies to create a strong performance culture from the start, supporting a 30x growth, just like it did for us. If you’ve ever wanted to join a completely new product from the start, this is your chance.
As an Engineer at Revolut, you’ll never work alone. You'll work alongside the brilliant minds behind Revolut People, collaborating with Data Scientists, Analysts, and Product Owners to create impressive solutions for our customers.
Are you the one we’re looking for? Let’s get in touch.
What You’ll Be Doing

Building APIs, making sure they’re properly designed and scaled as Revolut People scales
Thinking of complex features from scratch, system designing a solution that's fast but scales
Helping to decide which direction we should take Revolut People to become the best in-class
Creating data pipelines, powering reporting, data science, and analytics

What You'll Need

5+ years of experience working as a Software Engineer
3+ years of engineering experience with Python as your primary language
Fluency in Python, SQL, and other OOPLs
Experience with API development and integration
A practical understanding of distributed systems

The ability to write concurrent code in IO/CPU bound situations
Experience with containerisation, IaC, CI/CD, monitoring, and alerting

Nice to have

Familiarity with prototyping and sketching
Multiple side projects or open source contributions
Exposure to GCP

Building a global financial super app isn’t enough. Our Revoluters are a priority, and that’s why in 2021 we launched our inaugural D&I Framework, designed to help us thrive and grow everyday. We're not just doing this because it's the right thing to do. We’re doing it because we know that seeking out diverse talent and creating an inclusive workplace is the way to create exceptional, innovative products and services for our customers. That’s why we encourage applications from people with diverse backgrounds and experiences to join this multicultural, hard-working team.

People deserve more from their money. More visibility, more control, more freedom. And since 2015, Revolut has been on a mission to deliver just that. With an arsenal of awesome products that span spending, saving, travel, transfers, investing, exchanging and more, we've helped 45+ million customers get more from their money. And we're not done yet.

As we continue our lightning-fast growth,‌ two things are essential to continuing our success: our people and our culture. We've been officially certified as a Great Place to Work™ in recognition of our outstanding employee experience! So far, we have 10,000+ people working around the world, from our great offices or remotely, on our mission. And we're looking for more. We want brilliant people that love building great products, love redefining success, and love turning the complexity of a chaotic world into the simplicity of a beautiful solution.

About The Role

Our Technology team isn’t just one of the best in the industry. It's one of the best in the world. And we’re proud of it. It’s our driving force — our engine 🚀

From building a new financial backend to creating an award-winning app, there’s nothing (and we mean nothing) our tech team can’t do.

Our Technology team isn’t here to fix legacy systems — it’s here to build world-class financial products from the ground up. Products that'll be used by millions of people around the world 🌎

You may expect our Python Engineers to work on heavily regulated financial systems, but we love the unexpected. We’re better known internally for writing high-quality code and building complex novel solutions end-to-end.

These geniuses have created our chatbot — the lovely Rita — and they didn’t stop there. They’ve also created automated FinCrime quality controls in a few weeks. Yes, they’re just that good!

You’ll never work alone, either. As a Python Engineer, you’ll sit within a Product Team simultaneously working with Data Scientists, Analysts, Engineers, Product Owners, and Operations Managers to solve problems and make our rocket ship fly even higher.

Watch this video to discover how our Engineering department is structured and what we expect from our brilliant engineers. If you’re up for the challenge of shaping the future of finance, let’s get in touch.

What You’ll Be Doing


Building APIs, making sure they're properly designed and scaled according to business needs
Creating data pipelines to pull data from production services into our data warehouse, powering reporting, data analytics, and data science
Writing event consumers to build new data models to provide this data to new flows and processes


What You'll Need


5+ years of experience working as a Software Engineer
3+ years engineering with Python as your primary language
An academic background in a STEM subject
Fluency in Python, SQL, and other OOPLs
Experience with API development and integration

The ability to write concurrent code in IO/CPU bound situations
Experience with Docker, K8s, Ansible, Teamcity, monitoring, and alerting


Nice to have


Experience with prototyping and sketching
Multiple side projects or open source contributions
Exposure to GCP
Experience with Django Framework


Building a global financial super app isn’t enough. Our Revoluters are a priority, and that’s why in 2021 we launched our inaugural D&I Framework, designed to help us thrive and grow everyday. We're not just doing this because it's the right thing to do. We’re doing it because we know that seeking out diverse talent and creating an inclusive workplace is the way to create exceptional, innovative products and services for our customers. That’s why we encourage applications from people with diverse backgrounds and experiences to join this multicultural, hard-working team.

People deserve more from their money. More visibility, more control, more freedom. And since 2015, Revolut has been on a mission to deliver just that. With an arsenal of awesome products that span spending, saving, travel, transfers, investing, exchanging and more, we've helped 45+ million customers get more from their money. And we're not done yet.

As we continue our lightning-fast growth,‌ two things are essential to continuing our success: our people and our culture. We've been officially certified as a Great Place to Work™ in recognition of our outstanding employee experience! So far, we have 10,000+ people working around the world, from our great offices or remotely, on our mission. And we're looking for more.

About The Role

Our Technology team isn’t just one of the best in the industry. It's one of the best in the world, and we’re proud of it. It’s our driving force — our engine 🚀

From building a new financial backend to creating an award-winning app, there’s nothing (and we mean nothing) our tech team can’t do.

You may expect our Python Engineers to work on heavily regulated financial systems, but we love the unexpected. We’re better known internally for writing high-quality code and building complex novel solutions end-to-end.

These geniuses created our chatbot — the lovely Rita — and they didn’t stop there. They’ve also created automated FinCrime quality control in just a few weeks. Yes, they’re that good!

This role offers the opportunity to relocate to Poland, Portugal, or Spain. You'll receive support from Revolut throughout the entire process. Once you move, you'll have the flexibility to work remotely or in a hybrid model in our offices in Barcelona, Madrid, Lisbon, Porto, or Kraków.

Up for the challenge? Let's get in touch.

What You’ll Be Doing


Building APIs, making sure they're properly designed and scaled according to business needs
Creating data pipelines to pull data from production services into our data warehouse, powering reporting, data analytics, and data science
Writing event consumers to build new data models to provide this data to new flows and processes


What You'll Need


5+ years of experience working as a Software Engineer
3+ years of experience engineering with Python as your primary language
An academic background in a STEM subject
Fluency in Python, SQL, and other OOPLs
Experience with API development and integration
A practical understanding of distributed systems
The ability to write concurrent code in IO/CPU bound situations
Experience with Docker, K8s, Ansible, Teamcity, monitoring, and alerting


Nice to have


Experience with prototyping and sketching
Multiple side projects or open source contributions
Exposure to GCP
Experience with Django Framework


Building a global financial super app isn’t enough. Our Revoluters are a priority, and that’s why in 2021 we launched our inaugural D&I Framework, designed to help us thrive and grow everyday. We're not just doing this because it's the right thing to do. We’re doing it because we know that seeking out diverse talent and creating an inclusive workplace is the way to create exceptional, innovative products and services for our customers. That’s why we encourage applications from people with diverse backgrounds and experiences to join this multicultural, hard-working team.

With an arsenal of awesome products that span spending, saving, travel, transfers, investing, exchanging and more, we've helped 45+ million customers get more from their money. And we're not done yet.

As we continue our lightning-fast growth,‌ two things are essential to continuing our success: our people and our culture.

About The Role

Our Technology team isn’t just one of the best in the industry. It's one of the best in the world, and we’re proud of it. It’s our driving force — our engine 🚀

From building a new financial backend to creating an award-winning app, there’s nothing (and we mean nothing) our tech team can’t do.

You may expect our Python Engineers to work on heavily regulated financial systems, but we love the unexpected. We’re better known internally for writing high-quality code and building complex novel solutions end-to-end.

These geniuses created our chatbot — the lovely Rita — and they didn’t stop there. They’ve also created automated FinCrime quality control in just a few weeks. Yes, they’re that good!

This role offers the opportunity to relocate to Poland, Portugal, or Spain. You'll receive support from Revolut throughout the entire process. Once you move, you'll have the flexibility to work remotely or in a hybrid model in our offices in Barcelona, Madrid, Lisbon, Porto, or Kraków.

Up for the challenge? Let's get in touch.

What You’ll Be Doing


Building APIs, making sure they're properly designed and scaled according to business needs
Creating data pipelines to pull data from production services into our data warehouse, powering reporting, data analytics, and data science
Writing event consumers to build new data models to provide this data to new flows and processes


What You'll Need


5+ years of experience working as a Software Engineer
3+ years of experience engineering with Python as your primary language
An academic background in a STEM subject
Fluency in Python, SQL, and other OOPLs

A practical understanding of distributed systems
The ability to write concurrent code in IO/CPU bound situations
Experience with Docker, K8s, Ansible, Teamcity, monitoring, and alerting


Nice to have


Experience with prototyping and sketching
Multiple side projects or open source contributions
Exposure to GCP
Experience with Django Framework


Building a global financial super app isn’t enough. Our Revoluters are a priority, and that’s why in 2021 we launched our inaugural D&I Framework, designed to help us thrive and grow everyday. We're not just doing this because it's the right thing to do. We’re doing it because we know that seeking out diverse talent and creating an inclusive workplace is the way to create exceptional, innovative products and services for our customers. That’s why we encourage applications from people with diverse backgrounds and experiences to join this multicultural, hard-working team.
