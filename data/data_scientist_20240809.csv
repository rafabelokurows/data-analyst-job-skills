As a Senior ML/AI Engineer, you will play a central role in our new AI R&D team, leading the charge in discovering and implementing innovative AI and ML solutions that add great value to our users and customers.




Your mission will be to spearhead our AI and ML innovation, and drive our continued experiments with ML models to explore opportunities. You will leverage your knowledge in Python and BigQuery (or other Data Warehouses), where you have gained a good grasp of statistics, and statistical models. You have a broad experience from developing and using different families of ML frameworks and models, and likely have experience from experimenting and building products using LLMs, public or locally hosted.




You will have the opportunity to work with our extensive datasets, comprising millions of property listings, continuously enriched by the user interactions from our 1.3 million daily visits. This vast and continuously growing data source will be your playground for driving AI and ML experiments, providing a unique and dynamic environment where you can thrive. Your ability to adeptly navigate the setting of a mid-sized tech company and manage PR-based workflows and large-scale systems will be crucial to your success.




In this role, you will not only investigate and experiment with different AI technologies, but also collaborate closely with the existing Data & ML Platform team, responsible for developing our Data Platform and MLOps. Your leadership and insight will be essential in guiding our AI initiatives, shaping their direction, and ensuring their success. Your past experience from one or more roles such as Data Scientist, ML Engineer, or AI Engineer will equip you with the skills needed to excel.




We are looking for someone curious, courageous, and collaborative, with a bit of YOLO spirit. You should be passionate about leveraging ML and AI to create meaningful impacts and enhance user experiences. This role offers significant freedom to shape it according to business needs and your background, making your contribution vital to Hemnet’s AI journey. Join us and be a part of a team that enjoys working together to explore and implement innovative solutions that will transform our industry.




What we offer




Our office is located in the heart of Stockholm, where we meet weekly or as needed, with the flexibility to work from home as well. Enjoy 30 days of holiday plus 4 YOLO days, paid workouts, running classes/races, and flexible working hours. We provide comprehensive benefits to ensure you feel safe and supported, including pension benefits, parental leave top-up, and health insurance. Here’s our full benefit package 👈.




Our culture of sharing includes lab weeks twice a year, Friday demos, dev brekkies, and brown bags. Hemnet is a place where you can be yourself and have fun with others. We actively encourage you to explore and share your other passions – whether it's producing music, painting, or playing with clay.

About the New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt, the best place to order groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, and other retail goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!) 🚀

About The New Verticals Analytics Team

Our New Verticals Analytics team sits at the intersection of product development, strategic planning, and operational execution. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design, and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions, to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience that combines scientific expertise with stakeholder engagement. When you join this team, you will be taking ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from the ground up, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we want you on our team.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
4+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis using statistical software packages in Python or R.
Expertise in causal inference (Diff in Diff, Synthetic control).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Most companies ramble on about purpose and making the world a better place. And pretty often it feels a bit… well, forced. But we’d like to think that our story is special for real. Hear us out. The story of Nextory began in Syria, where our founders grew up. When they were children, they witnessed how the dictatorship limited the access to books, and saw what it did to their country. So when Shadi and Ninos came to Sweden, they made it their mission to make books available to everyone. Fast forward a few years, and Nextory was born. We offer a monthly subscription where our users can read and listen to as many books as they like. Sounds like a pretty cool product to work with, right? We think so too.







We’re on the hunt for a Data Scientist to join our amazing team on the quest of making the world a happier and more democratic place.




WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING

NGAs a Data Scientist at Nextory you will work with keeping and developing the data drivenness of Nextotry throughout the organization. With a curious, innovative and analytical mindset and tech-savvy approach you will fuel our data driven magic. You will be responsible for driving projects proactively and autonomous in close collaboration with the cross-functional teams and other stakeholders. You will be a part of an amazing team consisting of expertise within e.g Big data, ML/AI, data warehouse and tap into our wonderful world of data - always with the continuous aspiration to increase reading! The position is based in Stockholm and you report to our COO.







Who are you…

We believe that you are currently working in a similar role at a fast-moving company.

          <p>We know it, you know it. Most companies ramble on about purpose and making the world a better place. And pretty often it feels a bit… well, forced. But we’d like to think that our story is special for real. Hear us out. The story of Nextory began in Syria, where our founders grew up. When they were children, they witnessed how the dictatorship limited the access to books, and saw what it did to their country. So when Shadi and Ninos came to Sweden, they made it their mission to make books available to everyone. Fast forward a few years, and Nextory was born. We offer a monthly subscription where our users can read and listen to as many books as they like. Sounds like a pretty cool product to work with, right? We think so too.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>We’re on the hunt for a<strong> Data Scientis</strong>t to join our amazing team on the quest of making the world a happier and more democratic place.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING</strong></p><p>NGAs a Data Scientist at Nextory you will work with keeping and developing the data drivenness of Nextotry throughout the organization.

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

About The Consumer Data Science Team

Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists (Analytics) and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering team who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience that requires a good mix of technical and stakeholder engagement skills. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics or data science role. Data Scientists at Wolt take ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we're looking for someone like you.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland and Sweden. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
4+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent for product development (preferably consumer-facing).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Join us at Palm, a well-funded, early-stage fintech startup, on a mission to guide the world’s money flows. As part of our founding team of treasurers, finance specialists, and engineers, you'll help build a world-class treasury management system for enterprises.

Are you ready to build and own the machine learning/data science function from the ground up? Based in Amsterdam or Stockholm and open to mostly remote work? We want to hear from you!

About Palm Engineering

Engineering at Palm today consists of a team of five engineers with diverse engineering and cultural backgrounds. We are located in Amsterdam and Stockholm, mostly working remotely with frequent gatherings in one of our locations or at off-sites where it is warmer and sunnier 🏖️

The engineering team has been working together since November 2023 so there is still a lot of opportunities for high impact work as well as playing an important role in further shaping the engineering organisation and culture.

Palm Engineering is defined by our principles:


Bias to Action: In the face of uncertainty, we prototype fast and often.
Open Communication: We courageously voice concerns to realign our direction as needed.
Passion for Challenges: We love the problem and embrace challenges.


In order to achieve this we lean on a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing, where curiosity, respect and openness are some of our guiding principles. We truly value diversity and are happy to have our perspectives challenged. And of course, let’s have fun together!

Our tech stack


Data Pipelines: Python, BigQuery
Database: PostgreSQL
Cloud: GCP
Version Control: Git
We are continuously iterating and exploring technologies as we go - so there’s more to come!


How will you make an impact?


Our customers need to understand what happened across their bank accounts in the past as well as how balances evolve in the future. We have our first categorization & forecasting models for this. You’ll join as the first Data hire with a broad mandate:
Define success metrics for our models
Create & evaluate forecasting & LLM models to drive those metrics
Build internal tooling to customise models to new enterprise customers
Build infrastructure to monitor performance and act on it
Build the underlying data infrastructure together with our engineering team (you’ll meet them during the interviews!)
Explore new technologies that improve all of the above.
Collaborate with engineers, designers and founders (they come from Fintech & Treasury!) to understand better what needs to be built and speak up when we are focusing on the wrong things


Our wish list


There are a lot of different paths into Data. We think you might have:
5+ years of experience in software engineering with 2+ years experience in ML/DS
OR 5+ years in business-facing ML/DS with a keen interest in the underlying data infrastructure
Experience with maintaining production-level ML solutions, with solid software engineering and ML principles
Strong Python and SQL skills
Experience with ML frameworks e.g. Tensorflow or PyTorch
Experience with data analysis libraries e.g. numpy, pandas or jax
Being proactive and love picking up new things
Able to collaborate and clearly communicate your ideas
High sense of ownership
Nice to Have:
Experience with LLM-based features
Experience in product improvement and data visualisation.
Experience with MLOps

Benefits Of Working At Palm


Travel: Meet all your new colleagues at quarterly offsites - the last 3 were in Lisbon, Stockholm & Amsterdam.
WeWork Membership: Work from home is our go-to - we love spending time with friends and family instead of commuting. We have WeWork memberships for when you want to escape into the city.
Stock Options: Own a large chunk of Palm and reap the rewards as you help us grow the company to a global player.
Pension & Health Insurance: Best-in-class local insurances and pension schemes so you don't have to worry.
Wellness Stipend: 500 EUR in annual wellness benefits - gyms, massages, you name it.

Data at Wolt

As the scale of Wolt has rapidly grown, we are introducing new users to our data platform every day and want this to become a coherent and streamlined experience for all users, whether they’re Analysts, Data Scientists working with our data or teams bringing new data to the platform from their applications. We aim to both provide new platform capabilities across batch, streaming, orchestration and data integration to serve our user’s needs, as well as building an intuitive interface for them to solve their use cases without having to learn the details of the underlying tools.

In the context of this role we are hiring an experienced Software Engineer to provide in one the following workstreams

Data Governance

Wolt’s Data Group has already developed an initial foundational tooling in the areas of data management, security, auditing, data catalog and quality monitoring, but through your technical contributions you will ensure our Data Governance tooling is state of the art. You’ll be improving the current Data Governance platform, making sure it can be further integrated with the rest of the Data Platform and Wolt Services in a scalable, secure, compliant way, without significant disruptions to the teams.

Data Experience

We want to ensure our Analysts, Data Scientists, and Engineers can discover, understand, and publish high-quality data at scale. We have recently released a new data platform tool which enables simple, yet powerful creation of workflows via a declarative interface. You will help us ensure our users succeed in their work with effective and polished user experiences by developing our internal user-facing tooling and curating our documentation to the highest standards. And what's best, you get to work closely with excited users to get continuous feedback about released features while supporting and onboarding them to new workflows.

Experimentation

We build and maintain our internal experimentation platform, Regatta, which supports A/B testing across the whole organization. We keep on expanding the capabilities of our platform, work in areas such as experiment distribution, analysis and on the front end used by our colleagues around the world. In this workstream you will be improving our current platform and work on our next generation experimentation experience.

At the time you’ll join we’ll match you with one of these work streams based on our needs and your skills, experience and preferences.

How We Work

Our teams have a lot of autonomy and ownership in how they work and solve their challenges. We value collaboration, learning from each other and helping each other out to achieve the team’s goals. We create an environment of trust, in which everyone’s ideas are heard and where we challenge each other to find the best solutions. We have empathy towards our users and other teams. Even though we’re working in a mostly remote environment these days, we stay connected and don’t forget to have fun together building great software!

Our tech stack

Our primary programming language of choice is Python. We deploy our systems in Kubernetes and AWS. We use Datadog for observability (logging and metrics). We have built our data warehouse on top of Snowflake and orchestrate our batch processes with Dagster. We are heavy users of Kafka and Kafka Connect. Our CI/CD pipelines rely on GitHub actions and Argo Workflows.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Germany. Read more about our remote setup here.

Our humble expectations

Our humble expectations

The vast majority of our services, applications and data pipelines are written in Python, so several years of having shipped production quality software in high throughput environments written in Python is essential. You should be very comfortable with typing, dependency management, unit-, integration- and end-to-end tests. If you believe that software isn’t just a program running on a machine, but the solution to someone’s problem, you’re in the right place.

Having previous experience in executing complex projects that touch multiple teams/stakeholders and run across a whole organization is a big plus. Good communication and collaboration skills are essential, and you shouldn’t shy away from problems, but be able to discuss them in a constructive way with your team and the Wolt Product team at large.

Familiarity with parts of our tech stack is definitely a plus, but we hire for attitude and ability to learn over knowing a specific technology that can be learned.

The tools we are building inside of the data platform ultimately serve our many stakeholders across the whole company, whether they are Analysts, Data Scientists or engineers in other teams that produce or consume data.

We want all of our users to love the tools we’re building and that is why we want you to focus on building intuitive and user friendly applications that enable everyone to use and work with data at Wolt.

Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Fernanda (fernanda.prado.e.silva@wolt.com).

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 700+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 60 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

About The Consumer Data Science Team

Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists (Analytics) and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering team who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience that requires a good mix of technical and stakeholder engagement skills. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics or data science role. Data Scientists at Wolt take ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we're looking for someone like you.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland and Sweden. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
4+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent for product development (preferably consumer-facing).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!
