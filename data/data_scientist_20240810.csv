Drive product innovation. You’ll infuse the UnitedMasters product with responsive, algorithmic insights that highlight systemic opportunities for artists to expand their influence and put themselves on the path to success.
Evangelize robust measurement. You will develop robust measurement strategies across experimentation, modeling, and analytics, including owning the process of gathering, extracting and compiling data sources across relevant tools like SQL, DBT and Python. You will challenge others to use data that is accurate and unbiased.
Develop deeper customer intelligence. You will enable the team to more deeply understand our artists and the opportunities we have to fuel their success.


Knowledge, Skills And Abilities

You’re a we-first team player who loves music and is passionate about helping artists grow, earn, and thrive.

Individual pay rate decisions are based on a number of factors, including qualifications for the role, experience level, skillset, and balancing internal equity relative to peers at the company. We expect the majority of the candidates who are offered roles at our company to fall healthily throughout the range based on these factors.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe’s mission is to build the economic infrastructure for the internet. Risk Engineering brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s financial and regulatory risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. We build ML and backend systems to catch fraudsters, understand users’ cash flow and financial health, and ensure Stripe’s users are compliant with regulatory and financial partner requirements. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from financial losses that can put Stripe’s business at risk.

The Risk group consists of machine learning, backend, and full stack engineers who tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We are undertaking several new efforts, where you can have an outsized impact on the architecture, implementation, and design choices behind these systems.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching models
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly reduce Stripe’s financial losses
Building systems that evaluate businesses for risk and take appropriate actions
Working with our partner teams to launch new policies that directly impact Stripe’s bottom line
Helping engineers across the company to develop technologies for scaling our infrastructure
Debugging production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 2 years of industry experience in training ML models
Enjoy and have experience shipping ML models in a large-scale production environment
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


Have experience in Python, Scala (Spark), or Ruby



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

Who we are:

Shape a brighter financial future with us.

Together with our members, we’re changing the way people think about and interact with personal finance.

We’re a next-generation financial services company and national bank using innovative, mobile-first technology to help our millions of members reach their goals.

We’re proud to come to work every day knowing that what we do has a direct impact on people’s lives, with our core values guiding us every step of the way. Join us to invest in yourself, your career, and the financial world.

The goal of this platform is to provide new ways for our partners to help their employees get their money right across every life stage.

Success in this role hinges on your technical aptitude, quantitative abilities, and business acumen: you know how to plow through data with SQL/Python/R/Tableau, surface insights using math/statistics/ML techniques, and measure the business impact using efficiency/conversion/profit metrics.

Own end-to-end product analytics workflow including formulating success metrics, socializing them across the organization, and creating dashboards/reports.
Act as a curator of data by defining, instrumenting, and tracking necessary analytics of our products by working cross functionally with engineering and product teams.
Build self-service systems to enable others in the organization to leverage your work.
Analyze and perform statistical analysis on data that underlies product experiments.
Build models to help decision makers understand customer behaviors and segmentation
You stay focused on what’s best for the company – sometimes that requires being flexible, other times it requires being steadfast.



What you’ll need:



Bachelor’s degree required (Masters preferred) in Computer Science, Math, Physics, Engineering or quantitative field.
4+ years of relevant work experience
Intellectual curiosity and aptitude to pick up new technical skills
Exceptional problem-solving skills
Ability to initiate and drive projects to completion with minimal guidance

Nextdoor is where you connect to the neighborhoods that matter to you so you can belong. Our purpose is to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.

Neighbors around the world turn to Nextdoor daily to receive trusted information, give and get help, get things done, and build real-world connections with those nearby — neighbors, businesses, and public services. Today, neighbors rely on Nextdoor in more than 315,000 neighborhoods across 11 countries.

Meet Your Future Neighbors

Product finance, strategy and operations (“Product FSO”) is committed to driving growth through new user acquisition and increasing engagement amongst our existing user base of Neighbors. Today, we work closely with product and engineering teams to understand the impact and trends across growth and engagement while building and maintaining quarterly and long-range forecasts. Historically, we’ve been strong in our reporting and forecasting; however, are still building the bandwidth and capabilities to dive deeper into our data to better understand “why” we’re seeing what we’re seeing to subsequently get to “what” we should be doing about it.

We are looking for an entrepreneurial and driven Senior Data Scientist to build these Business Intelligence capabilities and establish the foundation of our data and analytics work. You will work closely with various cross-functional teams such as product, engineering, etc. to develop a BI layer and assist us in better understanding key metrics through causal analyses, data tooling, and dashboarding. Successful candidates will exhibit technical acumen, product sense and business savvy. You are passionate about leveraging the power of data to drive product changes with quality and agility. You are a team player.

At Nextdoor, we offer a warm and inclusive work environment that embraces a hybrid employment experience, providing a flexible experience for our valued employees.

The Impact You’ll Make

Role

The work of Product FSO is essential to the growth and success of the company and involves frequent opportunities to showcase key metrics and findings to senior leadership. In this role, you will:


Partner closely with Finance and ProdDev leads to identifying strategic, high-impact analytical problems and innovative ways to solve them with data
Insight discovery: Deliver data insights and drive for adoption through tools (e.g. dashboards, self-serve reporting), memos and presentations. Additionally, analyze data to identify trends, discrepancies, and opportunities for improvement. Provide actionable recommendations and insights to senior management to facilitate informed decision-making
Analytics and Forecasting: Conduct statistical analyses and modeling, exploratory/causal analysis, and metric development to uncover data insights that in turn better inform key decisions and enable driver-based forecasting of user activity.
Performance management support: Assist in our weekly performance tracking and management of business operations. Ensure accuracy and timeliness in performance reporting, helping the team meet its short and long-term objectives
Analytics foundation: Partner with our Analytics Engineering team to create and maintain a solid data foundation using advanced data analysis tools and techniques. Extract and manipulate large datasets to create meaningful metrics and insights that inform strategic decisions
Collaboration: Facilitate data ownership and accountability by closely partnering with data science, product, and engineering partners to improve data robustness
Participate in in-person Nextdoor events, trainings, off-sites, volunteer days, and other team building exercises
Build in-person relationships with team members and contribute to the KIND culture that Nextdoor values


What You’ll Bring To The Team


6 - 8+ years working in data science, product analytics, or business intelligence, or equivalent (starting level is flexible)
Strategic-minded, impact-driven, and capable of incorporating larger business context into data questions and product development
Experience architecting, debugging, and executing SQL queries
Excellent knowledge of Looker (preferred) or another BI/visualization tool
Comfortable knowledge of Python or R, including common scientific computing packages and data science tools such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn
Comfort with methods, tools, and packages for statistical modeling and machine learning
Experience formulating, running, and sharing complex analyses, including different types of experiments, cohort retention studies, and other exploratory analysis work
Intermediate knowledge of at least one big data technology such as Hive, Presto, or Spark
Excellent written and oral communication, including ability to effectively communicate complexity to a diverse group of stakeholders
Curiosity about how things work, from both a business and technical perspective
A self-starter who thrives under a high level of ambiguity and autonomy


It’s ok if you don’t have all of these requirements; if you think you’d be a good fit for the role, please get in touch with us!

Bonus Points


Past experience in solving problems in Finance or other business-facing areas
Work experience related to social or community-based products
Work experience related to small businesses and marketplaces
Work experience related to advertising and auction systems
Expertise deploying models to production
Expertise in testing and evaluating the impact of network effects
Knowledge of web applications and service-oriented architecture


Rewards

Compensation, benefits, perks, and recognition programs at Nextdoor come together to create one overall rewards package.

The starting salary for this role is expected to range from $175,000 to $210,000 on an annualized basis, or potentially greater in the event that your 'level' of proficiency exceeds the level expected for the role.

We also expect to award a meaningful equity grant for this role. With equal quarterly vesting, your first vest date would be within the first 3 months of your start date.

Overall, total compensation will vary depending on your relevant skills, experience, and qualifications. We have you covered! Nextdoor employees can choose between a variety of great health plans. We cover 100% of your personal monthly premium for health, dental, and vision – and provide a OneMedical membership for concierge care.

About the project

On the battlefield, injured soldiers can face significant delays in medical treatment or evacuation due to ongoing hostilities and treacherous terrain. Traditional methods of casualty care rely on limited information and may put medics at unnecessary risk: medics often lack a comprehensive picture of the battlefield, hindering their ability to locate and prioritise casualties while minimising exposure to threats. The TaMaCare project emerges from this critical observation, aiming to revolutionise battlefield casualty care by creating a real-time digital twin of the frontline. More precisely, we aim to improve response times and decision-making in critical situations. The proposed digital twin aims to provide medics with a clear view of the battlefield, encompassing the location of injured soldiers, their vital signs, and any structures or potential dangers present in the vicinity.




Expected results

The impact of TaMaCare on battlefield casualty care is multifaceted and far-reaching:

Faster and better decision making: TaMaCare will create a digital twin of the battlefield for use by the rear echelon and decision makers, allowing faster response times and improved decision-making. The digital twin will provide real-time information of the environment, casualty location and their health status, allowing medics to make informed decisions about treatment priorities and evacuation routes, considering factors like urgency, (environmental) hazards, and resource availability. The detailed 3D map, including casualties and threats, can also be used to plan optimal evacuation routes, taking into account terrain, obstacles, and the physical condition of casualties.
Reduced risk for soldiers and medics: The digital twin will be created using unmanned systems, i.e. without putting soldiers in harm’s way. By providing a clear picture of potential threats, TaMaCare allows medics to navigate the battlefield with greater awareness and minimise their exposure to danger.
Post-action analysis: The digital twin allows for an after action analysis of the decision and actions that were made, allowing to draw lessons for future interventions.

The benefits of TaMaCare extend beyond immediate casualty care and contribute to a broader strengthening of defence capabilities. In fact, the project fosters advancements in 3D mapping, threat detection/assessment through image processing, and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) localization networks. These advancements have broader applications for military and civilian operations and for intelligence gathering: planning for offensive/defensive operations, re-assessment of the geometrical environment after man-made or natural calamities, improved navigation of unmanned vehicles, removal of UXO/IED (Unexploded Ordnance/Improvised Explosive Devices), etc.




Your role

The research in TaMaCare will be performed by a Belgian consortium. The role of the researcher hired for this job offer will focus on the development of AI models and ML techniques to facilitate, automate and simplify detection of threats on the battlefield using electromagnetic (panchromatic, multispectral or hyperspectral) sensors in the visible and infrared spectrum based on their spatial or spatio-spectral signature.

          <p><strong>APPLICATION BY EMAIL according to the application rules hereunder (not via LinkedIn). Please attach all the documents asked.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>About the project</strong></p><p>On the battlefield, injured soldiers can face significant delays in medical treatment or evacuation due to ongoing hostilities and treacherous terrain. Traditional methods of casualty care rely on limited information and may put medics at unnecessary risk: medics often lack a comprehensive picture of the battlefield, hindering their ability to locate and prioritise casualties while minimising exposure to threats. The TaMaCare project emerges from this critical observation, aiming to revolutionise battlefield casualty care by creating a real-time digital twin of the frontline. More precisely, we aim to improve response times and decision-making in critical situations. The proposed digital twin aims to provide medics with a clear view of the battlefield, encompassing the location of injured soldiers, their vital signs, and any structures or potential dangers present in the vicinity.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Expected results</strong></p><p>The impact of TaMaCare on battlefield casualty care is multifaceted and far-reaching:</p><ul><li>Faster and better decision making: TaMaCare will create a digital twin of the battlefield for use by the rear echelon and decision makers, allowing faster response times and improved decision-making. The digital twin will provide real-time information of the environment, casualty location and their health status, allowing medics to make informed decisions about treatment priorities and evacuation routes, considering factors like urgency, (environmental) hazards, and resource availability. The detailed 3D map, including casualties and threats, can also be used to plan optimal evacuation routes, taking into account terrain, obstacles, and the physical condition of casualties.</li><li>Reduced risk for soldiers and medics: The digital twin will be created using unmanned systems, i.e. without putting soldiers in harm’s way. By providing a clear picture of potential threats, TaMaCare allows medics to navigate the battlefield with greater awareness and minimise their exposure to danger.</li><li>Post-action analysis: The digital twin allows for an after action analysis of the decision and actions that were made, allowing to draw lessons for future interventions.</li></ul><p>The benefits of TaMaCare extend beyond immediate casualty care and contribute to a broader strengthening of defence capabilities. In fact, the project fosters advancements in 3D mapping, threat detection/assessment through image processing, and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) localization networks. These advancements have broader applications for military and civilian operations and for intelligence gathering: planning for offensive/defensive operations, re-assessment of the geometrical environment after man-made or natural calamities, improved navigation of unmanned vehicles, removal of UXO/IED (Unexploded Ordnance/Improvised Explosive Devices), etc.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Your role</strong></p><p>The research in TaMaCare will be performed by a Belgian consortium.

About The Role

Our screening team is responsible for sanctions, PEPs (Politically Exposed Persons) and Adverse Media screening.

The screening team has a name matching service that is routinely tested against an internal benchmarking suite, and annually against external benchmarking suites.

We are looking for someone to own the testing, tuning and optimisation of these matching algorithms. The candidate will own this function - be responsible for the overall testing and tuning strategy, deep dive testing results, understanding how to optimise rules for efficiency and effectiveness and create rules for complex controls.

Here’s How You’ll Be Contributing


Automatising algorithm testing on real customer data as well as synthetic data. Packaging the service into a library or deploying it to staging or production environments
Benchmark testing
Analyse results from exact name matching and fuzzy name matching against internal and external benchmarks
Identify and categorise types of missed cases and map those to known or new issues
Propose technical solutions to reduce the number of missed cases identified
Benchmark creation
Design an internal test set to evaluate both the precision and recall of the screening engine
Align performance on the test set with real-life production performance
Extend internal benchmarking to new scenarios for better coverage of screening algorithms
Define an overall strategy for testing and tuning
Evaluate the use of an internal benchmarking tool
Evaluate testing capabilities of external vendors in the market to define the most effective method of continuous external benchmarking, processes of governance
Tailor business rules to reduce hit rate, prepare tuning data, reviewing hit reduction strategies and work with product managers, compliance and engineers to ensure roadmap alignment
Rule optimisation
Tweaking engine configuration to find the sweet spot for precision and recall.
Provide answers on how many historical true positives we would miss based on different optimisations
Work on advanced rules for complicated controls, such as vessel screening
Uncover and action on opportunities to help the Screening operational team scale
Automatising or creating solutions to assist operations in their work
Modify existing tooling introducing LLM assistants to improve the efficiency of agents and speed of case resolution

A Bit About You


Experience implementing, testing and evaluating performance of multiple rules across systems;
Strong Python knowledge. Ability to read through code, especially Java. Demonstrable experience collaborating with engineering on services;
Strong algorithmic design and testing skills. A big plus for proven experience with name matching algorithms;
Experience with statistical analysis and good presentation skills to drive insight into action;
A strong product mindset with the ability to work independently in a cross-functional and cross-team environment;
Good communication skills and ability to get the point across to non-technical individuals;
Strong problem solving skills with the ability to help refine problem statements and figure out how to solve them.


Some Extra Skills That Are Great (but Not Essential)

Come contribute to our growing body of tools, research, and IP that make blockchain and crypto data more accessible.

Who You Are

&#55358;&#56814; You love data and stats. You know some formal statistics, ML, and data exploration techniques, even better if you’ve done network analysis.

&#55357;&#56988; You love crypto and DeFi, know the difference between hodling, staking, and yield farming, and you have used both Ethereum and other chains.

&#55357;&#56425;‍&#55357;&#56507; You are self-directed. You are insatiably curious. You can be counted on to work through a project, commit and go deep while seeking help when you need it, and propel it forward without hand-holding.

&#55357;&#56528; You are fastidious and meticulous in your work. You will put in the time to make an order from chaos. You’ve looked into the eye of Sauron and lived to make a graph. You don’t mind doing the “grunt work” to build up to the full picture, or go as low as it takes? Muckraking? More like fun-making.

&#55356;&#57256; You're creative and you aren't afraid to be wrong.

&#10052;&#65039; You are super comfortable in SQL-like databases (we use Snowflake)

®&#65039; You are intimately familiar with R for analysis, exploration, and model-building. And you have an opinion about data. table vs dplyr. Python is OK too, but we have a lot of R code, so you need to be comfortable there.

&#55356;&#57331;&#65039;‍&#55356;&#57096; You take pride in your code. It's readable, functional, and reproducible. You commit regularly for all the right reasons.

&#55358;&#56785;‍&#55356;&#57323; You can describe a complex problem (or solution) in a way that doesn't put people to sleep and doesn't leave them scratching their heads.

Who You Are

&#55358;&#56814; You love data and stats. You know some formal statistics, ML, and data exploration techniques, even better if you’ve done network analysis.

&#55357;&#56988; You love crypto and DeFi, know the difference between hodling, staking, and yield farming, and you have used both Ethereum and other chains.

&#55357;&#56425;‍&#55357;&#56507; You are self-directed. You are insatiably curious. You can be counted on to work through a project, commit and go deep while seeking help when you need it, and propel it forward without hand-holding.

&#55357;&#56528; You are fastidious and meticulous in your work. You will put in the time to make an order from chaos. You’ve looked into the eye of Sauron and lived to make a graph. You don’t mind doing the “grunt work” to build up to the full picture, or go as low as it takes? Muckraking? More like fun-making.

&#55356;&#57256; You're creative and you aren't afraid to be wrong.

&#10052;&#65039; You are super comfortable in SQL-like databases (we use Snowflake)

®&#65039; You are intimately familiar with R for analysis, exploration, and model-building. And you have an opinion about data. table vs dplyr. Python is OK too, but we have a lot of R code, so you need to be comfortable there.

&#55356;&#57331;&#65039;‍&#55356;&#57096; You take pride in your code. It's readable, functional, and reproducible. You commit regularly for all the right reasons.

&#55358;&#56785;‍&#55356;&#57323; You can describe a complex problem (or solution) in a way that doesn't put people to sleep and doesn't leave them scratching their heads.

What You'll Work On

Work directly with the company's community, our internal analytics & data platform teams.

Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to explore, visualize, and validate our data.

Work closely with our marketing team to share what we learn with the world, and educate anyone who wants to learn more.

Support the efforts of our product teams to help transform our apps into more data-driven, web3-connected, powerful experiences for our growing base of thousands of users.

Desired Experience

Experience with Crypto/Blockchain is a requirement.

Prior experience as an analyst or data scientist, working directly with database-level data, whether formally or self-taught.

At least 2 years in a formal data science role, ideally working primarily in R

Experience working with product & marketing teams, developers, and data engineers
