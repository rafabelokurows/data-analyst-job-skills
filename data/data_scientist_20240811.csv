About the New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt, the best place to order groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, and other retail goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!) 🚀

About The New Verticals Analytics Team

Our New Verticals Analytics team sits at the intersection of product development, strategic planning, and operational execution. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design, and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions, to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience that combines scientific expertise with stakeholder engagement. When you join this team, you will be taking ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from the ground up, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we want you on our team.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
4+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis using statistical software packages in Python or R.
Expertise in causal inference (Diff in Diff, Synthetic control).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

You are open to learning new techniques, languages, tools, and theories that will enrich your knowledge base about data science and beyond.




Proven knowledge of Python is required, and will be demonstrated during the interview process. Experience in SQL, Javascript, or LookML is desirable.




You communicate fluently in written and spoken English.




You love variety and new challenges and really thrive when working in a team.

Not only are we entertainment obsessives ourselves, but we also own the world's largest streaming guide, which gives us unparalleled data and insights on audience behaviors and content tastes.




From a small startup, we've evolved into a 200+ strong team, based in Berlin, around the world, or working remotely. We've been all about building a profitable business while riding that wave of impressive growth.




Who we need

Are you tired of academia? Do you get more satisfaction from delivering business results and great questions instead of producing research papers? Are you building a deep intuition about data and how to define success before going deep with algorithms? If you're a builder who is fearless in challenging conventions and bringing new ideas to the table, we want to hear from you! To bring our tailor-made tools for the needs of the movie industry to the very next level.




What you will be doing

Own the machine room of the data products driving our business. Given a proper understanding of our business model, what would you like to do?
Improve our automated campaign steering and drive home every flight on target and on time.
Work on our mean hybrid interest signals data machine.
Collaborate directly with the founders of JustWatch on the business brain of our company and lead your team to deliver on time.
And advance our targeting by extracting every ounce of entertainment intelligence from our recommendation system based on massive user and item data.
Don't start from scratch. Draw from years of data engineering excellence and a treasure trove of meaningful quality data you can model on from day one. Iterate with boring technology and keep it simple. Snowflake, Python, Pytorch, Scipy, XGBoost. You'll start introducing more complexity where it makes sense.
Build prototypes based on smart assumptions in three days instead of planning to outperform the SoTA in three months.
Understand our rich internal Recommendations-ML-Engine to pull from. Work on classical (non-)linear optimization problems through tabular modeling, forecasting, normalization, and NLP.
Steal liberally from basic research instead of attempting it yourself.




What we need from you

You are an expert in machine learning and data science, but you see yourself more as a solutions engineer than a scientist.
An executionist mentality- someone who is less academic more of a renegade.
You get satisfaction from delivering business results and asking great questions rather than from producing research papers.
A system thinker who intuitively understands data and defines success well before diving into algorithms.
Constant learning, delivering results, and creating value are the core characteristics of everyone at JustWatch and we are looking for these values in every person we hire.




What we offer you

An open-minded and international team that loves to collaborate to reach our goals.
We believe in a permission-less environment that lets us focus on delivering value without overcomplicating things.
We prioritize meaningful work over perks and that true fulfillment comes from intrinsic motivation, personal growth, and making a lasting impact.
We trust our skilled professionals to maintain a no-nonsense attitude and create an environment that promotes innovation.
We are committed to helping you achieve your personal and professional goals, and we offer a collaborative and supportive environment to do so.
Truly a hybrid work environment. You are not required to come to the office, but you will want to.




While a solid technical background is crucial, we are looking for someone who is not just a scientist or nerd but also can think strategically and work effectively with different stakeholders in JustWatch. If you have the personality, skills, and experience we are looking for, and if you are genuinely excited about the opportunity to drive business growth through machine learning and data science, we want to hear from you!




Media is important to us and we are always happy to hear from people who enjoy film! If you feel like you are missing some of the hard skills – don’t worry, we are hiring for the attitude, values, and personality.




If we caught your attention and you're eager to delve into our perspectives and thought processes, we recommend immersing yourself in our blog post, which elaborates on these subjects:




A company culture that really works
Audience as a Service

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.

Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As an Economist at Deliveroo you will help scale our business and improve the experience for restaurants, riders, and eaters. Using experimental or observational data, you will get to help answer questions like:



Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the business impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
Can the Delivery food market sustain multiple players?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants?
What impact do online reviews have?
How will a change in the user interface affect customer choice behaviour?



The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Requirements:



Masters Degree or PhD in Economics or Econometrics (preferred)
Always curious and willing to learn new skills
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business-relevant economic problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
Proficiency with analytical tools like R/Python and familiarity with SQL
Ideally industry experience since the completion of your academic career
Excellent people skills — you’ll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into economic problems



At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. The scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Why Deliveroo

Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.

We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

Workplace & Benefits

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know.

Job Title: Data Scientist

Reports to: Data Science Lead

Department: Strategy, Policy & Insights

Location: London, Leeds, Manchester, Glasgow, Bristol

Job Grade: M

Department Description

The Strategy, Policy & Insight (Function) are trusted thought-leaders bringing expert strategy, policy, market & audience insight – challenging and advising the business to drive delivery of Channel 4’s strategy and remit.

The purpose of the new centralised Audience Insights (Subfunction) is to be independent thought leaders at the heart of Channel 4’s creative and commercial decision-making, bringing a single source of truth and big picture perspective, challenging and advising the business to ensure profitable business growth through the use of data.

Within the new centralised operating Insights model (where all audience and market insight in C4 is centralised into the Audience Insight team), each C-Suite Leader (CEO, Chief Content Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Revenue Officer, Chief Marketing Officer and the Exec Committee as a body) and their Senior Leaders have a dedicated Insight Business Partner (BP) who prioritizes and agrees their Insight requirements, aligned to the strategic C4 pillars. BP Analysts directly source available analysis and where additional, bespoke research or specialised analysis is required, the BP will commission this from the relevant Specialist Lead, managing jointly the presentation back of recommendations to the C-Suite Leader.

The Data Science team builds machine learning products that have made Channel 4 better to watch and make millions each year. We work with big and varied datasets (billions of views, millions of users, natural language subtitles, and video) with modern tools (Python, Spark, AWS), on a range of problems using multiple techniques, from recommender systems to clustering to NLP to probabilistic graphical models.

Job Purpose

Working under the direction of the Data Science Lead this role is a subject matter expert in using advanced data techniques, exploring new content & product data sets & creating new data tools/models to make predictions about future viewer & market behaviours, providing C4 C-Suite and their Senior Leaders (via the Insight Business Partner) with ‘predictive next best action’ recommendations on which they can make business decisions.

b) Predictive Analysis (algorithms which present viewers with suggested viewing based on their previous choices)
c) Data Monetization (leveraging a revenue stream from data matching with external adsales partners (eg. Identifying the top 3 shows watched by people who buy mascara to upsell linear / streaming advertising slots for that product)
Responsible alongside the Data Science Lead for educating Insight BP’s and Senior Leaders on the game-changing power of Data Science to inform their decisions, clearly articulating the complex style of analysis in a way that bridges to their business challenges to bring clear business value and return on investment and driving up the profile of the data science specialism. This involves understanding the business relevant objectives and helping the Insight BP’s to join up their thinking to apply data science capability in a focussed and relevant way to meet these needs.
Deliver complex analyses which synchronise high volumes of audience, content & product data, building algorithms to build predictions which personalise and forecast audience and business performance in a way that Exec and Senior Leaders can use for their business decisions
Distil data insight into clear & relevant ‘predictive next best actions’ which map directly onto business challenges & goals, which can be easily understood & actioned by C4 leaders, telling the story on how this delivers to their business challenge
Responsible for building collaborative external networks, scanning industry and data science trends to identify new and innovative tools and methods which can add value for C4, and contributing to the build of a business case to recommend purchase (where appropriate) to the Reporting & Data Enablement Lead who holds the central budget for Insights tools.
Responsible for quality assuring the data and insight provided from analysis working collaboratively with other Insight specialists to ensure a joined-up, robust and accurate information is given to the Exec and Senior Leader decision-makers

We have an amazing opportunity for a Data Scientist to join our amazing team here at Virgin Media O2.

You'll be hands-on role and work across multiple exciting programs of work including personalisation, operations and network data science capabilities. You’ll be building ML models and writing code in real time services powering the virgin media digital products (website and apps), our marketing capabilities, network efficiency and ensuring our operations are running optimally.

A normal week might look like writing prediction models, digging into data to look for opportunities, implementing code for production services, pair coding and modelling with more senior scientists and engineers, feeding back into an established data engineering / ML Ops team to determine platform choices for data scientists to be most efficient and effective.

We’re primarily a Google and Python shop. It’s fine if your background is in Azure, AWS or another cloud technology provider, but some experience with cloud or open source data science tools is expected. Reasonable experience in engineering in Python is required, scientists in this team are working on real time services, paired up with software and data engineers. This isn’t a job where scientists spend all their time in notebooks, some part is actually moving models into production as part of the team. You’ll feed requirements and suggestions into the current state of technologies and help to choose new ones as well, primarily we build in house.

Who we are

The UK’s fastest broadband network. The nation’s best-loved mobile brand. And, one of the UK's biggest companies too.

Diverse, high performing teams - jam packed with serious talent. Together, we offer the UK more choice and better value, through our boundary-pushing, customer-championing values and ambitions.

Together, we are Virgin Media O2, and we can't wait to see what you can do.

Accessible, inclusive and equitable for all

Virgin Media O2 is an equal opportunities employer and we're working hard to remove bias and barriers for our people and candidates. So, we build equity and inclusion into everything we do, from the policies we craft to the relationships we shape. We support and encourage you to be your authentic self throughout your application journey with us.

The must haves

In order to be considered, you must have the following experience;


Experience applying knowledge in statistics and machine learning to real world commercial problems
Experience bringing live services using machine learning and python to production.
Strong knowledge of Python and relevant libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, Scikit-learn, tensorflow, etc…) knowledge in other programming languages is valuable, but this is primarily a Python shop.
Experience with things like CI/CD pipelines, Docker or similar, cloud hosting, good software engineering practices – we have an ML Ops team but as a principal you need to be familiar with why these things are good and how to use/do them
Experience working in an agile software development environment
Strong maths or computer science background gained through MSc/PhD education in scientific field / computer science
Ability to translate consumer business problems into data science use cases and requirements



The other stuff we are looking for


Good interpersonal skills offering ability to explain complex techniques to non-technical audience
Focus on implementation and business impact of modelling through commercial acuity
Proactive and creative while considering approaches to use data to solve problems.
Advanced data preparation and munging skills with ability to transform data into suitable formats and outputs.
Ability to visualise and communicate findings in an understandable manner to non-technical users



What's in it for you

Our goal is to celebrate our people, their lives and everything in-between. We aim to create a culture that empowers everyone to bring the best versions of themselves to work each and every day. We believe the most inclusive and diverse culture makes for a better business and a brighter world.

Working at Virgin Media O2, you get a bumper reward package bursting with benefits, and loads of extras you can add if you’d like to. These are designed to support both you and your loved ones, making sure that you’re covered no matter what life throws your way.

Next steps

If we feel like a place where you can belong, we'd love to learn more about you as a person and your experience to date. Once you've submitted an application the next steps of the process, if successful, are likely to include a two-stage interview process including technical and competency assessments.

When you apply, you'll be asked about any adjustments you might need to support the recruitment process. Let us know, and we'll be sure to discuss it with you. Thanks for your patience in the meantime and for showing an interest in joining the Virgin Media O2 family.

Exploring new datasets, extracting insights, and visualizing the results
Leading design, development, and deployment of machine learning systems, bringing their technical knowledge and experience into the team, and using this to create real solutions to real problems.
Collaborating with cross-functional technology teams to gather requirements and ensure the solutions align with business objectives
Helping integrate the team’s solutions (including GenAI) into existing systems and platforms to provide seamless user experiences and scale adoption.
Actively participating in code reviews, experiment design and tooling decisions to help drive the team’s velocity and quality
Helping build data and machine learning expertise within the business through knowledge sharing
