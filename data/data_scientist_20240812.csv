The company was founded on the belief that understanding the repertoire of T cell receptor (TCR)-antigen immune synapses that maintain health and drive disease represents one of the greatest opportunities for innovation in medical science. Repertoire scientists created and developed the DECODETM platform, which allows in-depth characterization of TCR-antigen pairs, and the ability to deploy this information in the form of novel targeted immune medicines to fundamentally reprogram the immune system to kill tumors or induce immune homeostasis.

From its sites in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Zurich, Switzerland, Repertoire’s team is advancing a pipeline of DECODE-enabled immune medicines, such as TCR bispecifics and mRNA cancer vaccines for treatment of solid tumors and mRNA tolerizing vaccines for treatment of autoimmune diseases.

Repertoire was founded by Flagship Pioneering and is supported by a strong investor base. In addition, the company recently entered a strategic partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop tolerizing vaccines for up to three autoimmune diseases.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work.

You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

Who You Are

&#55358;&#56814; You love data and stats. You know some formal statistics, ML, and data exploration techniques, even better if you’ve done network analysis.

&#55357;&#56988; You love crypto and DeFi, know the difference between hodling, staking, and yield farming, and you have used both Ethereum and other chains.

&#55357;&#56425;‍&#55357;&#56507; You are self-directed. You are insatiably curious. You can be counted on to work through a project, commit and go deep while seeking help when you need it, and propel it forward without hand-holding.

&#55357;&#56528; You are fastidious and meticulous in your work. You will put in the time to make an order from chaos. You’ve looked into the eye of Sauron and lived to make a graph. You don’t mind doing the “grunt work” to build up to the full picture, or go as low as it takes? Muckraking? More like fun-making.

&#55356;&#57256; You're creative and you aren't afraid to be wrong.

&#10052;&#65039; You are super comfortable in SQL-like databases (we use Snowflake)

®&#65039; You are intimately familiar with R for analysis, exploration, and model-building. And you have an opinion about data. table vs dplyr. Python is OK too, but we have a lot of R code, so you need to be comfortable there.

&#55356;&#57331;&#65039;‍&#55356;&#57096; You take pride in your code. It's readable, functional, and reproducible. You commit regularly for all the right reasons.

&#55358;&#56785;‍&#55356;&#57323; You can describe a complex problem (or solution) in a way that doesn't put people to sleep and doesn't leave them scratching their heads.

What You'll Work On

Work directly with the company's community, our internal analytics & data platform teams.

Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to explore, visualize, and validate our data.

Work closely with our marketing team to share what we learn with the world, and educate anyone who wants to learn more.

Support the efforts of our product teams to help transform our apps into more data-driven, web3-connected, powerful experiences for our growing base of thousands of users.

Desired Experience

Experience with Crypto/Blockchain is a requirement.

Prior experience as an analyst or data scientist, working directly with database-level data, whether formally or self-taught.

At least 2 years in a formal data science role, ideally working primarily in R

Experience working with product & marketing teams, developers, and data engineers
