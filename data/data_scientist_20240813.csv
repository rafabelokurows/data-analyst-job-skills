Job Description

What is the opportunity?

RBC is a global leader in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the banking sector in order to create value for our clients, with capabilities ranging from LLM-powered digital banking, boosting ensembles in fraud detection and AML, voice assistants in customer service, to algorithmic trading in capital markets. A failure to effectively prepare for and manage emerging model risk related to AI would subject RBC to financial, regulatory, and reputational risks and, as a result, RBC would not be able to provide its clients with the best quality service. Therefore, the AI validation team within RBC’s Enterprise Model Risk Management (RBC Group Risk Management) is tasked with overseeing, assessing, and managing the model risk that may arise from these AI capabilities.

The AI validation team uses machine learning, statistical, and computational strategies to assess model risk. In doing so, RBC is able to identify model weaknesses early and enhance the reliability of production models across all lines of business.

What will you do?


Application: You will have the opportunity to work in any of the many areas we work in, across an even wider variety of business functions, such as the following:


Types of Models

Classification, regression, anomaly detection, natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning, recommendation systems, dimensionality reduction, Large Language Models including generative AI

Business Functions

Internal Audit, Cybersecurity, Fraud Management, Anti-Money Laundering, Insurance, Credit Risk, Technology Operations, Identity & Access Management, Human Resources


Validation: Your role is to challenge models and identify risks associated with their use – both conceptually and empirically. To that end, you will design and execute validation frameworks, exploring modelling considerations such as conceptual soundness, data processing, metric reproducibility & stability, benchmarking, robustness, uncertainty quantification, fairness, privacy, explainability, implementation controls and more. You will also have the freedom to explore ideas that interest you and build your own models and tools.
Research & Development: You will read research papers (established work and state-of-the-art) to enhance how our team validates models and contribute to our knowledge pool. You are encouraged to apply what you’ve learned to real-world problems, develop reusable software packages, and share your insights with others.
IT: You will collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to establish and promote best-practices related to MLOps, tooling and IT infrastructure.
Governance: You will work with model developers (data scientists, researchers, engineers) and business stakeholders to inventory applications of AI and machine learning at the bank, determine their materiality, and assess whether they require review.


What do you need to succeed?

Must-have


Passionate about learning and staying up-to-date with research and technology
Strong communication and interpersonal skills
Progress towards a PhD or Master’s degree in Statistics, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Econometrics, Engineering, Quantitative Finance, or a related quantitative field
Proficient programming skills in Python or a similar language; you should already be comfortable with writing research experiments and be willing to learn how to write clean code.
Familiarity with popular machine learning frameworks and libraries


Nice-to-have


A risk-oriented mindset: You are curious about the “how” as well as the “why""
Publication or prior research experience (applied or fundamental)
Experience with version control systems
Comfortable with command line tools


What’s in it for you?

As a team, we thrive on the challenge to be our best, encourage progressive thinking for continued growth, and collaborate with one another to deliver trusted advice to help our clients thrive and our communities prosper. We respect and care about all of our team members and support one another in reaching our fullest potential.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Including your own.

The Impact You’ll Make

Role

With treatments for hundreds of diseases in our sights, we’ve built a data science team with domain expertise in computer science, bioinformatics, physics, biology, mathematics, applied statistics, and more. We work side-by-side with biologists, automation scientists, chemists, software engineers, and many others; together, we develop the tools and methods to turn our experimental data into treatments for pathologies that affect the lives of countless individuals. As a data scientist with a digital chemistry focus, you will design and build chemistry analysis, models and workflows. In addition, you will be a part of a multidisciplinary team that will support you in advancing your projects from idea to a deployed solution that will help Recursion advance drug candidates. In this role, you will:


Partner with chemists and biologists to understand their processes and the questions that they are asking at each stage of the drug discovery funnel
Develop methods, metrics, benchmarks, and models to help drive drug discovery in a standardized way.
Convert exploratory analysis into production-quality functions that can be incorporated into in-house Python packages and that support at-scale generation of data packages to accelerate decisions on passing programs through internal stage gates.
Create and analyze enormous sets of connected data for a variety of programs to learn how best to advance drug discovery in an industrialized way
Collaborate with engineering teams to mature your models and analyses and put them into productionized workflows
Deliver quickly and iteratively, both supporting ad-hoc requests and building improvements for the long-term in agile workstreams
Learn to leverage new code packages and data science techniques as needed


Location:

Making Toronto, Ontario your home base is ideal, however, we will consider on-site work in our Salt Lake City, Utah office as well | Expected to be on-site 50% of the time.

The Team You’ll Join

Our purpose is to build, test, support, and improve the Machine Learning (ML) models that drive RecursionOS. Our scope of work is vast, including the development of benchmarks, the refinement of our models and maps, and supporting their widespread adoption across the organization.

Our goal is to foster continuous, hypothesis-driven improvements inspired by experimental outcomes. This will be achieved by establishing robust ML operational practices that accelerate model development, testing, and deployment. We will work with all Recursion scientists to develop a clear understanding of our models, uncover new biology & chemistry, make meaningful predictions, and profile the applicability of our methods. Identifying performance gaps and model limitations will inspire new benchmarks, data sources, representations, model architectures, and training strategies.

The Experience You’ll Need


4+ years practical experience applying probability, statistics, and machine learning to real-world datasets in service of academic or business applications and recommendations.
3+ years of experience in the field of digital chemistry (particularly medicinal chemistry)
Experience participating in projects that routinely call for cross-disciplinary collaboration, involving the communication of complex theories and techniques to audiences with a range of technical backgrounds.
High fluency with the Python data science stack and chemistry specific libraries.
Experience in creating compelling visualizations of high-dimensional data that enable clear decision-making and interpretation.
Experience in collaborative software development and peer code review, including version control tools like git.
Experience working within a fast-paced interdisciplinary team to solve business-relevant problems.
Nice to have: experience training deep learning models with ML libraries like pytorch, tensorflow, etc.
Nice to have: experience developing, releasing, and maintaining data products in a continuous-use production environment.


How You’ll Be Supported


You will be assigned a peer trail guide to support you as you onboard and get familiar with Recursion systems.
Regular 1:1s with supervisor provides opportunities for support and feedback
Receive real-time feedback on code quality and best practices from a team of peers.
Ability to participate and learn from your colleagues in our regular all-hands, journal club & tech talks for Data Science.
Option to publish research and/or attend conferences to learn more from colleagues, networks, and more to better your skillset.

The Values That We Hope You Share


We Care: We care about our drug candidates, our Recursionauts, their families, each other, our communities, the patients we aim to serve and their loved ones. We also care about our work.
We Learn: Learning from the diverse perspectives of our fellow Recursionauts, and from failure, is an essential part of how we make progress.
We Deliver: We are unapologetic that our expectations for delivery are extraordinarily high. There is urgency to our existence: we sprint at maximum engagement, making time and space to recover.
Act Boldly with Integrity: No company changes the world or reinvents an industry without being bold. It must be balanced; not by timidity, but by doing the right thing even when no one is looking.
We are One Recursion: We operate with a 'company first, team second' mentality. Our success comes from working as one interdisciplinary team.


Recursion spends time and energy connecting every aspect of work to these values. They aren’t static, but regularly discussed and questioned because we make decisions rooted in those values in our day-to-day work. You can read more about our values and how we live them every day here.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Payment Intelligence ML organization optimizes each of the billions of dollars of transactions processed by Stripe annually on behalf of our customers, maximizing successful transactions while minimizing payment costs and fraud. We leverage ML to serve real-time predictions as part of Stripe’s payment infrastructure and risk controls. We own products like Radar, Adaptive Acceptance, and Identity end-to-end, operating lightning fast world-scale services and cutting-edge ML models.

What you’ll do

We are looking for Machine Learning Engineers to own the end-to-end lifecycle of applied ML model development and deployment in service of consumer facing products like Radar, Adaptive Acceptance, and Identity. You will work closely with software engineers, machine learning engineers (MLE), data scientists (DS), and ML platform infrastructure teams to design, build, deploy, and operate Stripe’s ML-powered payment decisioning systems, including improving existing ML models and developing new ML solutions.

Responsibilities


Design and deploy new models using tools (such as Spark, Presto, XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch) and iteratively improve verification and fraud models to protect millions of users from fraud
Envision and develop new models for fraud detection i.e work with large payment datasets to find creative new methods of detecting and deterring fraudulent behavior.
Propose new feature ideas and design real-time data pipelines to incorporate them into our models.
Integrate new signals into ML pipelines, derive new ML features, and build workflows to make this process fast
Integrate new models and behaviors into Stripe’s core payment flow
Collaborate and execute projects cross-functionally with the data science, product management, infrastructure, and risk teams
Ensure engineering outcomes meet or exceed established standards of excellence in code quality, system design, and scalability
Mentor engineers earlier in their technical careers to help them grow
Propose and implement innovative product ideas to reduce costs and combat fraud at Stripe



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Over 3+ years industry experience building machine learning applications in large scale distributed systems.
2+ year of experience working within a team responsible for developing, managing, and optimizing ML models or ML infrastructure
Experience designing and training machine learning models to solve critical business problems
Experience performing analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to model performance and business metrics



Preferred Qualifications


An advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. stats, physics, computer science)
Proven track record of building and deploying machine learning systems that have effectively solved critical business problems
Experience in adversarial domains like Payments, Fraud, Trust, or Safety
Experience working in Python, Java and / or Ruby codebases
Experience in software engineering in a production environment.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $173,100 - $316,800. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.
