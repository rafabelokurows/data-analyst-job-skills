Our team consists of experts in machine learning, data science, software engineering, mathematics, and design. We share a passion for data & analysis, operate at the cutting edge, and believe in a pragmatic approach to solving hard problems.

THE ROLE

As a Machine Learning Engineer, you'll know how to engineer beautiful code in Python and take pride in what you produce. You'll be an advocate of high-quality engineering and best-practice in production software as well as rapid prototypes.

Whilst the position is a hands-on technical role, we'd be particularly interested to find candidates with a desire to lead projects and take an active role in leading client discussions. Your responsibilities will involve building trusted relationships with prospects, finding creative ways to use machine learning to solve problems, scoping projects, and overseeing the delivery of these engagements.

To be successful, you will need strong ML & Data Science fundamentals and will know the right tools and approach for each ML use case. You'll be comfortable with model optimisation and deployment tools and practices. Furthermore, you'll also need excellent communication and consulting skills, with the desire to meet real business needs and deliver innovative solutions using AI & Cloud.

Your responsibilities will include:


Taking vague requirements and translating them into models that solve real-world problems
Running machine learning experiments using a programming language with machine learning libraries.
Optimising solutions for performance and scalability.
Implementing custom machine learning code.
Data engineering, i.e. ensuring a good data flow between database and backend systems.
Data science, i.e. analysing data and coming up with use cases
MLOps, i.e. automating ML workflows with testing, reproducibility and metadata/feature storage; Designing ML architectures on Google Cloud


Requirements


1-3 years experience as an ML Engineer, ideally from a consulting background.
This candidate should be comfortable working with python as a backend language, delivering code in well-tested CI/CD pipelines.
Familiarity with cloud environments (Google Cloud, AWS, Azure).
Experience with Software Engineering.
Good knowledge of SQL.
Knowledge of scaling up computations (GPUs, distributed computing, ..).
Familiarity exposing ML components through web services or wrappers (e.g. Flask in Python).
Strong communication and presentation skills.


Datatonic is an equal-opportunity employer. We're committed to building an inclusive team that welcomes a diversity of perspectives, people, and backgrounds regardless of race, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, disability, citizenship, veteran status, or any other protected status. Our current team is made up of folks from very different backgrounds, including a former librarian, oceanographer and comic bookstore owner! If you are on the fence about whether you meet our requirements, we encourage you to apply anyway. Please reach out to us directly at join@datatonic.com if you need assistance or accommodation due to disability.

People deserve more from their money. More visibility, more control, more freedom. And since 2015, Revolut has been on a mission to deliver just that. With an arsenal of awesome products that span spending, saving, travel, transfers, investing, exchanging and more, we've helped 45+ million customers get more from their money. And we're not done yet.

As we continue our lightning-fast growth,‌ two things are essential to continuing our success: our people and our culture. We've been officially certified as a Great Place to Work™ in recognition of our outstanding employee experience! So far, we have 10,000+ people working around the world, from our great offices or remotely, on our mission. And we're looking for more. We want brilliant people that love building great products, love redefining success, and love turning the complexity of a chaotic world into the simplicity of a beautiful solution.

About The Role

We approach Data Science at Revolut the same way that we approach everything else – with class, logical thinking, and lots of style 😎 Let’s break it down: we take the most complex problems and create tailor-made solutions for our customers 🚀 If you’re thinking the Data team is kept in some sort of a secret den, doomed to never see the impact of their work, don’t worry - that’s not how we do things. They’re some of our best and brightest problem-solvers, deployed to the front lines to work in product teams and deliver rockstar solutions 🤘

We start with deep data analysis to understand our customers, their objectives and any issues they might have. We then use various data points and advanced machine learning algorithms, to come up with the best possible option for each client. We experiment, iterate, and build fully automated solutions, based on algorithms which self-improve with time.

We’re looking for next-level Data Scientists to board our FinTech rocket ship and shape the future of financial services apps. Phew! It’s a big task, but you won’t do it alone. 💪

You’ll be working with the toughest and most gifted professionals in Product, Design, Data Science and Engineering, on impactful projects that’ll make our company move forward ⏩

People deserve more from their money. More visibility, more control, more freedom. And since 2015, Revolut has been on a mission to deliver just that. With an arsenal of awesome products that span spending, saving, travel, transfers, investing, exchanging and more, we've helped 45+ million customers get more from their money. And we're not done yet.

We’re looking for a next-level Data Scientist to board our fintech rocket ship and shape the future of financial services apps. Phew! It’s a big task, but you won’t do it alone. You’ll be working with the toughest and most gifted professionals in Product, Design, Data Science, and Engineering on impactful projects that’ll make our company move forward ⏩

This role offers the opportunity to relocate to Poland, Portugal, or Spain. You'll receive support from Revolut throughout the entire process. Once you move, you'll have the flexibility to work remotely or in a hybrid model in our offices in Barcelona, Madrid, Porto, or Kraków.

Up for the challenge? Let's get in touch.

What You’ll Be Doing


Building models for full Retail Credit lifecycle
Improving existing algorithms and building new Proofs of Concept

#MuchMoreThanJustAJob

Early morning. Campo 24 de Agosto. In 4 minutes, you are clocking in at the office. After grabbing a cup of coffee and fresh fruit, pick up your laptop and choose your spot for the day. It's going to be a busy one: French class before lunch and, just after, quick medical appointment at Natixis doctor's office.

Lunch break. Outside in the big terrace (look at your crops at the Urban Garden; ready to harvest!) or, if you feel like stretching your legs, walk downtown to grab lunch.

Back inside. Quick sprint review (working together anywhere means virtual happy birthday to that colleague in Paris that just turned 35). The afternoon went flying (tasks, reports, calls, some jokes with your teammates). End it on a high note: just one PlayStation game or the final match for that ping-pong tournament.

Tomorrow, you complete that certified technical training and the day after, you will work from home, taking advantage to finally do that online course on Udemy. Once you are done with your tasks for the day, you can visit the office for a board games session or show up at the rehearsal of one of Natixis bands. If that is too steady for you, meet your colleagues to surf some waves or join them in a football match.
