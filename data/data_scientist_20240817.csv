Enabled by advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics, Machina Labs is developing software-defined factories of the future. The mission of the company is to develop modular manufacturing solutions that can be reconfigured to manufacture new products simply by changing the software. The company is currently working to build the first commercial robotic sheet metal forming machine. Machina Labs is funded and backed by major investors (NVIDIA, Innovation Endeavors and Lockheed Martin) in the field of AI and Deep Tech. Job Description As a Machine Learning Engineer and an early member of our small team, you will own a significant portion of our product and the company. You will develop models to accurately predict important process parameters that are used in our production systems. Every second our robots and the sensors generate a tremendous amount of data that needs to be properly captured, stored, analyzed, and modeled to enable new smart manufacturing technologies. These technologies will enable our leading aerospace and automotive customers to make parts faster, cheaper and enable production of parts that weren't possible. You’ve ideally developed empirical models based on data in information technology companies before and you are now excited to bring the same techniques to underserved industries like the manufacturing. You are also a skilled software developer and can build reliable software that uses your models. This role requires you to follow agile development practices and understand how to implement quality software that is continuously integrated and deployable to our production cells. The models you build will have different varieties. The data can be both structured or unstructured. You are in charge of properly defining the problems you are solving, capturing the right data, doing experimentations, cleaning data, modeling and deploying your models. One day you might be using regression to predict forces we see in our manufacturing processes and another day you might use neural networks to predict deformation in our parts from scanned parts. Responsibilities


Work closely with the Engineering team to uncover opportunities for machine learning automation and predictive modeling across all Machina Labs offerings
Perform data mining to find interesting and impactful data and finally develop, train and deploy models
Define proper metrics for each project that can tie into the business objective

Help other members of the team with data analysis and proper interpretation of data
Proper A/B testing of different solutions or models
Build pipeline that supports running multiple machine learning models in parallel in production
Build monitoring tools to understand the data quality and performance of complex systems
Empathetically help other engineers grow
Actively participate in the interview process



Qualifications


Bachelor’s, MS or Ph.D. in related fields (Data Science, Computer Science and Machine Learning, Statistics or a quantitative-related field) or equivalent professional experience
2+ years of experience with machine learning systems, algorithms or applications such as deep learning and time series analysis

We’re developing new tools and capabilities to amplify the human experience. To lead this transformative shift in mobility, we’ve built a world-class team in Energy & Materials, Human-Centered AI, Human Interactive Driving, and Robotics.

The Mission

Make general-purpose robots a reality via large-scale embodied AI.

The Challenge

We envision a future where robots assist with household chores and cooking, aid the elderly in maintaining their independence, and enable people to spend more time on the activities they enjoy most. To achieve this, robots need to be able to operate reliably in messy, unstructured environments. Our mission is to answer the question “What will it take to create truly general-purpose robots that can accomplish a wide variety of tasks in settings like human homes with minimal human supervision?”. To answer this, we are gathering large datasets of physical interaction from a variety of sources (including robots and people) and training large generative foundation models on this physical interaction data along with language, video, audio, and other rich modalities.

The Team

Our goal is to revolutionize the field of robotic manipulation, enabling long-horizon dexterous behaviors to be efficiently taught, learned, and improved over time in diverse, real world environments.

Our team has deep cross-functional expertise across simulation, perception, controls, language, vision, multimodal learning, and generative modeling. Success is measured by the advancement of robot capabilities and we’re strong believers in open research. Our north star is fundamental technological advancement in building robots which can flexibly perform a wide variety of tasks in diverse environments with minimal human supervision. Come join us and let’s make general-purpose robots a reality.

We operate a fleet of robots, and robot-embodied teaching and deployment are key parts of our strategy. Some of our previous work is highlighted here.

The Opportunity

We’re looking for a driven machine learning engineer comfortable working on large integrated machine learning systems. Experience with robots or other embodied systems (such as autonomous vehicles) is a bonus.

Jouw high-end rapporten bereiken honderden collega's en klanten binnen de Benelux. Dit vereist doorzettingsvermogen en de drive om te blijven groeien. Als Data Scientist is dit jouw rol bij DHL.







Dit ga je doen

Als Data Scientist speel je een cruciale rol in het ontwikkelen en implementeren van data gestuurde analyses. Deze analyses, gebaseerd op complexe datasets, bieden waardevolle inzichten voor DHL. Dit omvat het verwerken van grote hoeveelheden ongestructureerde data uit verschillende bronnen om DHL en haar klanten beter te dienen.

Je werkt met de nieuwste technologieën, zoals Azure Databricks, om de meest relevante waarden te presenteren aan afdelingen zoals Operations, Finance en Customer Service. Je werkt volgens de principes van Agile ontwikkeling aan uiteenlopende projecten binnen het gehele bedrijf. Jij bouwt het, jij runt het, jij bent verantwoordelijk! Je besteedt minimaal 32 uur per week aan:




Het analyseren van data, het identificeren van patronen en trends, en het presenteren van bevindingen aan belanghebbenden.
Samenwerken met teams binnen IT/Digital om de beste data gestuurde oplossingen voor te stellen.
Ondersteunen bij het beantwoorden van strategische en operationele vraagstukken door het ontwikkelen van datagestuurde analyses.




Jouw nieuwe werkplek

Je werkt op het hoofdkantoor van DHL eCommerce in Utrecht. Als Data Scientist werk je samen met ingenieurs, producteigenaren en andere wetenschappers in een Scrum-team. Naast je directe collega's heb je ook contact met andere teams en afdelingen. De afdeling Digital en IT, waar je voor werkt, bestaat nu uit 250 collega's.




We luisteren altijd naar wat je te zeggen hebt. Hoe meer perspectieven en meningen we horen, hoe beter we allemaal worden. Dat is waarom onze organisatie het Great Place to Work-certificaat heeft ontvangen, gebaseerd op feedback van medewerkers.




Dit ben jij

Het bouwen aan de toekomst van levering geeft je energie. Elke keer als je een DHL-van voorbij ziet komen, voel je een gevoel van trots - en terecht, want jij draagt bij aan de ontwikkeling ervan. Je bent een vastberaden individu dat goed gedijt in een teamomgeving. Bij DHL werk je met de nieuwste technieken aan grote en schaalbare platformen - een omgeving die je als geen ander aanspreekt.




Verder heb je:

Minimaal een hbo- of universitair werk- en denkniveau.
Minimaal 5 jaar ervaring in een soortgelijke functie.
Sterke programmeervaardigheden, bij voorkeur in Scala.
Ervaring met Spark, CI/CD, Terraform en Kafka.
De wil en nieuwsgierigheid om te werken met event-driven architecture.
Bekendheid met cloud-based oplossingen zoals Azure.




Dit krijg jij

Een baan om trots op te zijn! En niet zomaar een baan, wij gebruiken liever het woord carrière. Als Data Scientist wil jij je namelijk blijven ontwikkelen!




Voor de functie van Data Scientist kan jij rekenen op:

Een salaris tussen € 4.000,- en € 5.500,- bruto op basis van 40 uur, gebaseerd op je kennis en ervaring;
Een bonusregeling van 5%;
Standaard 23 vakantiedagen en 8% vakantiegeld;
Cao a la carte, een budget naar keuze voor extra salaris of vakantiedagen (4,5 dagen per jaar);
Reiskostenvergoeding tot 30 kilometer per enkele reis;
Pensioenregeling;
De mogelijkheid om hybride te werken;
Vanaf dag één uitgebreide opleidings- en trainingsmogelijkheden;
Kansen en mogelijkheden voor ontwikkeling en doorgroei, zowel nationaal- als internationaal!







De toekomst van bezorgen is geel-rood

DHL eCommerce is het meest toonaangevende logistiek bedrijf ter wereld. Dat klinkt misschien opschepperig, maar zo bedoelen we het niet: we zien het namelijk niet als een verdienste, maar als een verantwoordelijkheid. Dankzij onze positie kunnen we het verschil maken voor onze mensen, het milieu en de maatschappij. En dat blijkt: we zijn een Great Place to Work, hebben de groenste duurzaamheidsplannen in de logistiek en helpen via DHL Cares ontzettend veel mensen die dat hard kunnen gebruiken – daar zijn we trots op!

Jouw high-end rapporten bereiken honderden collega's en klanten binnen de Benelux. Dit vereist doorzettingsvermogen en de drive om te blijven groeien. Als Data Scientist is dit jouw rol bij DHL.







Dit ga je doen

Als Data Scientist speel je een cruciale rol in het ontwikkelen en implementeren van data gestuurde analyses. Deze analyses, gebaseerd op complexe datasets, bieden waardevolle inzichten voor DHL. Dit omvat het verwerken van grote hoeveelheden ongestructureerde data uit verschillende bronnen om DHL en haar klanten beter te dienen.

Je werkt met de nieuwste technologieën, zoals Azure Databricks, om de meest relevante waarden te presenteren aan afdelingen zoals Operations, Finance en Customer Service. Je werkt volgens de principes van Agile ontwikkeling aan uiteenlopende projecten binnen het gehele bedrijf. Jij bouwt het, jij runt het, jij bent verantwoordelijk! Je besteedt minimaal 32 uur per week aan:




Het analyseren van data, het identificeren van patronen en trends, en het presenteren van bevindingen aan belanghebbenden.
Samenwerken met teams binnen IT/Digital om de beste data gestuurde oplossingen voor te stellen.
Ondersteunen bij het beantwoorden van strategische en operationele vraagstukken door het ontwikkelen van datagestuurde analyses.




Jouw nieuwe werkplek

Je werkt op het hoofdkantoor van DHL eCommerce in Utrecht. Als Data Scientist werk je samen met ingenieurs, producteigenaren en andere wetenschappers in een Scrum-team. Naast je directe collega's heb je ook contact met andere teams en afdelingen. De afdeling Digital en IT, waar je voor werkt, bestaat nu uit 250 collega's.




We luisteren altijd naar wat je te zeggen hebt. Hoe meer perspectieven en meningen we horen, hoe beter we allemaal worden. Dat is waarom onze organisatie het Great Place to Work-certificaat heeft ontvangen, gebaseerd op feedback van medewerkers.




Dit ben jij

Het bouwen aan de toekomst van levering geeft je energie. Elke keer als je een DHL-van voorbij ziet komen, voel je een gevoel van trots - en terecht, want jij draagt bij aan de ontwikkeling ervan. Je bent een vastberaden individu dat goed gedijt in een teamomgeving. Bij DHL werk je met de nieuwste technieken aan grote en schaalbare platformen - een omgeving die je als geen ander aanspreekt.




Verder heb je:

Minimaal een hbo- of universitair werk- en denkniveau.
Minimaal 5 jaar ervaring in een soortgelijke functie.
Sterke programmeervaardigheden, bij voorkeur in Scala.
Ervaring met Spark, CI/CD, Terraform en Kafka.
De wil en nieuwsgierigheid om te werken met event-driven architecture.
Bekendheid met cloud-based oplossingen zoals Azure.




Dit krijg jij

Een baan om trots op te zijn! En niet zomaar een baan, wij gebruiken liever het woord carrière. Als Data Scientist wil jij je namelijk blijven ontwikkelen!




Voor de functie van Data Scientist kan jij rekenen op:

Een salaris tussen € 4.000,- en € 5.500,- bruto op basis van 40 uur, gebaseerd op je kennis en ervaring;
Een bonusregeling van 5%;
Standaard 23 vakantiedagen en 8% vakantiegeld;
Cao a la carte, een budget naar keuze voor extra salaris of vakantiedagen (4,5 dagen per jaar);
Reiskostenvergoeding tot 30 kilometer per enkele reis;
Pensioenregeling;
De mogelijkheid om hybride te werken;
Vanaf dag één uitgebreide opleidings- en trainingsmogelijkheden;
Kansen en mogelijkheden voor ontwikkeling en doorgroei, zowel nationaal- als internationaal!







De toekomst van bezorgen is geel-rood

DHL eCommerce is het meest toonaangevende logistiek bedrijf ter wereld. Dat klinkt misschien opschepperig, maar zo bedoelen we het niet: we zien het namelijk niet als een verdienste, maar als een verantwoordelijkheid. Dankzij onze positie kunnen we het verschil maken voor onze mensen, het milieu en de maatschappij. En dat blijkt: we zijn een Great Place to Work, hebben de groenste duurzaamheidsplannen in de logistiek en helpen via DHL Cares ontzettend veel mensen die dat hard kunnen gebruiken – daar zijn we trots op!
