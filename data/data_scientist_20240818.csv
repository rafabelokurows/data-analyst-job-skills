About Us

mediaire was founded in 2018 by Dr. Andreas Lemke and Dr. Jörg Döpfert – both physicists with a background in MRI physics.

The real founding history, however, dates back to 2009 when the scientific paths of Andreas and Jörg crossed several times with the renowned radiologist Prof. Henrik Michaely. Coming from different backgrounds and discovering that each had the same goal, the idea of a scientifically and economically successful high-tech product took shape – a software powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that allows highly efficient analysis of medical imaging data in Radiology to support radiologists in their daily routine.

During the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Develop and automate forecasting models to plan the capacity of the support centers across different locations.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track scheduling efficiency, occupancy rates, and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building forecasting models & time series analysis (Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters or similar).
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in Cost Analysis, What-if Scenario Analysis, Capacity planning, and Workforce Management is nice to have but not mandatory.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

Our approach is integrated, our teams are diverse with experience from journalism, corporate communications, digital communications, politics and investor relations.




The way we communicate is undergoing a fundamental change. This also applies to our clients, who find themselves confronted with entirely new stakeholder groups. In our Stakeholder Intelligence & Engagement Team, we assist our clients in understanding their stakeholders through quantitative and qualitative data analysis and in reaching them with tailored strategies across all communicative touchpoints, convincing them of our clients' objectives.




Join our Berlin team as (Junior) Full Stack Data Scientist.




What tasks can you look forward to?




Processing, cleaning, transforming and analyzing vast amounts of complex data, be it with standard, locally-trained AI models and ML algorithms, cutting-edge LLMs and other APIs, or other data mining procedures.




Conveying the results of such analyses to audiences with different backgrounds: from business and communication experts, to data scientists, statisticians, and mathematicians, in the form of formal non-technical presentations, rigorous written reports, or informal conversations.

You have proven experience in, or an eagerness to learn about, disciplines that complement the standard data science skillset, such as data engineering, software engineering, DevOps, MLOps, prompt engineering, QA/testing, etc.




You are open to learning new techniques, languages, tools, and theories that will enrich your knowledge base about data science and beyond.




Proven knowledge of Python is required, and will be demonstrated during the interview process. Experience in SQL, Javascript, or LookML is desirable.




You communicate fluently in written and spoken English.




You love variety and new challenges and really thrive when working in a team.







What we can offer you




Highly attractive starting salary




An inspiring working environment as well as the opportunity to work at one of our international offices for a limited period of time




Exciting tasks and attractive development prospects




Induction and individual support from an experienced colleague




Deepening of your expertise with regard to different sectors and areas of competence through close cooperation of our integrated project teams




Continuous training opportunities (FGS Global Academy)




A dedicated, supportive and growing team




A corporate culture that combines excellence with team spirit




The opportunity to work flexibly both in our offices and from home




Don’t meet every single requirement? Please don’t worry! Studies have shown that some groups like women or people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single requirement. At FGS Global, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. So, if you’re excited about this role and our company but your previous professional experience doesn’t match perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we would like to encourage you to apply anyway.

About the Team

The Selection Analytics Team at Wolt owns the data and infrastructure that helps all 27 of our markets build a portfolio of high-quality restaurant and retail merchants. Our overarching mission is to provide the best selection to customers by enabling sales teams across all markets to acquire the best merchants.

To do this, we work directly with country sales teams to help them identify and prioritize the highest potential merchant candidates. We also work with Wolt leadership by providing metrics to track selection quality, upon which they develop strategic initiatives and goals. This is a lean and mighty team that owns and operates the engine for merchant acquisition globally.

About The Role

As a senior member of the Selection Analytics team, your role involves leveling up our approach to identifying and prioritizing better merchants. You’ll achieve this by a) developing metrics to unlock deeper insights into merchant selection quality for all markets b) developing and running experiments to understand the impact of selection on specific markets c) develop self-serve tooling to track these insights

This is also a rare, high-exposure experience where you will then use your findings to work directly with country leadership to help them uncover growth opportunities. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just crunching numbers and creating dashboards.

The team is looking for a versatile analytics expert who knows how to move fast, work cross-functionally, and deliver business results. If you are excited to build from 0 to 1, interested in global exposure, and have experience using deep analytics to solve hard problems - we're looking for someone like you.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these cities - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.

Our humble expectations


3-5 years of experience in data science, consulting, or related quantitative role
Strong exploratory data analysis skills, willingness to look under the hood.
Deep understanding of the data science workflow, including experimental design and key statistical methods, with strong communication skills for complex topics.
Proficiency in statistical programming languages (R, Python, etc.) and SQL.
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g. Looker)
Determination to initiate and lead/own strategic projects to completion in a scrappy environment with a cross-functional team
Innate curiosity to understand how things work and a first-principles approach to problem solving


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Lead - Marta Palac (marta.palac@wolt.com).

We are embarking on Project NAFAS, a landmark 30 million EUR initiative set to revolutionize the field.

We are seeking an innovative and skilled scientist with at least 1-3 years of experience and a specific combination of skills: The ideal candidate has profound knowledge of probabilistic machine learning modelling and of the application of these methods in the realm of (adaptive) human-computer interaction.

This particular position will focus on the design and development of neuroadaptive systems, i.e., systems that can adapt to the user's cognitive and emotional states in real time, based on a number of simultaneously obtained streams of data.

The end goal of this development is to provide the functionality necessary to meaningfully enhance user experience across various applications based on decoded brain activity, even when the exact interaction is not known or intentionally left open at design time. Therefore, a large weight is placed on creativity and ability to find new data-driven and/or machine learning modelling frameworks as well as designing, implementing, and validating proof-of-concept applications.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.

Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is to maximise business impact within one of many business areas. You will help answer questions like:



Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?



The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Requirements



A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)
Experience conducting A/B experiments
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems



Why Deliveroo

Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.

We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

Workplace & Benefits

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed.

About Us

Climate X is a purpose-driven climate adaptation data company set to revolutionise how the world manages assets, property, and infrastructure. 

We apply cutting-edge, peer-reviewed science to help prevent the worst impacts of climate change. We combine climate projections, remote sensing observations, and modelling to project the frequency and severity of physical climate risks such as floods, subsidence, storms, etc.

Our SaaS platform lets financial institutions and real estate firms look at future climate pathways to:


help identify how property/company assets could be damaged by severe weather events and
what that damage might do to the asset valuations.
become more resilient to climate change and make smarter investment and lending decisions.


We advocate diversity with our founders, team, and investors from various backgrounds.

We're not building just a team but a place of innovation where problem solving, and fun coexist to address the most significant challenge our society is facing now. 

The impact you'll own

As a Data Scientist at Climate X, you will join an interdisciplinary team of other Data Scientists, Climate Scientists and Geospatial experts, collaborating closely with our Engineering and Product teams to deliver impactful products to our clients.

This role will support our NLP model, a core product within the business. This will involve developing an existing code base, research time for exploring new techniques and algorithms, fine-tuning LLM models on domain-specific datasets to enhance the performance of our existing model, perform statistical analysis and techniques for model evaluation, analyse text data to extract meaningful insights and trends and create visualizations to communicate findings and facilitate understanding of the model across the business and our clients.

Essential Skills


Experience in a commercial Data Science role with strong understanding of machine learning algorithms and techniques (e.g., regression, classification, clustering), using ML packages in Python (such as sklearn, spaCy, NumPy, SciPy or others).
Experience with version control systems like Git for managing code changes and collaborating with team members. Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines (e.g. GitHub Actions) is a plus.
Experience with data visualisation tools and libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Power BI).
Experience with cloud services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure) for data storage and processing.
Ability to work with cross-functional teams using strong problem-solving skills and share insights to diverse audiences.


Nice to have


Experience with web scraping using Python (such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, Requests or others) is a plus.
Exposure to MLOps frameworks (such as MLFlow, Weights and Biases).
Knowledge of the financial services or real estate domain from a climate risk perspective, to inform a basic understanding of where data science is being applied, allowing for better context and interpretation of results.
Experience with processing and analysing geospatial data using Python (geopandas, GDAL, etc.) and/or other GIS software (such as QGIS) is a plus.

Our dazzle of zebras is a force to be reckoned with - they possess unwavering determination, take decisive action, push boundaries with innovative ideas, and thrive in an environment that offers autonomy, trust, and accountability to deliver exceptional outcomes.

The skills crisis is a colossal challenge, one that is expected to have a greater economic impact than the COVID-19 pandemic. The shortage of skilled workers is leaving millions of positions unfilled, and this crisis has been deemed by the World Economic Forum as one of the biggest challenges of our time, second only to climate change.

The world’s largest companies are transforming into skills-based organisations to survive, but most are struggling to do so without the proper tools. That's where we come in - we have built an innovative platform for workforce management that empowers companies to make skill-based decisions and thrive.

Our existing clients have already witnessed the positive impact that skill-based decision-making has on organisational performance, diversity, culture, and management insight. We have several FTSE100 customers and have recently secured £7.7 million in Series A funding.

We are now assembling the right team to help us become the leader in the multi-billion dollar skill-based workforce planning market. Our mission is clear and ambitious - we will unite 10 million people with opportunities at the world’s leading employers based on skills by 2030. In doing so, we will be driving a quarter of all people-decisions and will be making a significant contribution towards solving the skills crisis.

Job Description

What is the opportunity?

RBC is a global leader in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the banking sector in order to create value for our clients, with capabilities ranging from LLM-powered digital banking, boosting ensembles in fraud detection and AML, voice assistants in customer service, to algorithmic trading in capital markets. A failure to effectively prepare for and manage emerging model risk related to AI would subject RBC to financial, regulatory, and reputational risks and, as a result, RBC would not be able to provide its clients with the best quality service. Therefore, the AI validation team within RBC’s Enterprise Model Risk Management (RBC Group Risk Management) is tasked with overseeing, assessing, and managing the model risk that may arise from these AI capabilities.

The AI validation team uses machine learning, statistical, and computational strategies to assess model risk. In doing so, RBC is able to identify model weaknesses early and enhance the reliability of production models across all lines of business.

What will you do?


Application: You will have the opportunity to work in any of the many areas we work in, across an even wider variety of business functions, such as the following:


Types of Models

Classification, regression, anomaly detection, natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning, recommendation systems, dimensionality reduction, Large Language Models including generative AI

Business Functions

Internal Audit, Cybersecurity, Fraud Management, Anti-Money Laundering, Insurance, Credit Risk, Technology Operations, Identity & Access Management, Human Resources


Validation: Your role is to challenge models and identify risks associated with their use – both conceptually and empirically. To that end, you will design and execute validation frameworks, exploring modelling considerations such as conceptual soundness, data processing, metric reproducibility & stability, benchmarking, robustness, uncertainty quantification, fairness, privacy, explainability, implementation controls and more. You will also have the freedom to explore ideas that interest you and build your own models and tools.
Research & Development: You will read research papers (established work and state-of-the-art) to enhance how our team validates models and contribute to our knowledge pool. You are encouraged to apply what you’ve learned to real-world problems, develop reusable software packages, and share your insights with others.
IT: You will collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to establish and promote best-practices related to MLOps, tooling and IT infrastructure.
Governance: You will work with model developers (data scientists, researchers, engineers) and business stakeholders to inventory applications of AI and machine learning at the bank, determine their materiality, and assess whether they require review.


What do you need to succeed?

Must-have


Passionate about learning and staying up-to-date with research and technology
Strong communication and interpersonal skills
Progress towards a PhD or Master’s degree in Statistics, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Econometrics, Engineering, Quantitative Finance, or a related quantitative field
Proficient programming skills in Python or a similar language; you should already be comfortable with writing research experiments and be willing to learn how to write clean code.
Familiarity with popular machine learning frameworks and libraries


Nice-to-have


A risk-oriented mindset: You are curious about the “how” as well as the “why""
Publication or prior research experience (applied or fundamental)
Experience with version control systems

Therefore, the AI validation team within RBC’s Enterprise Model Risk Management (RBC Group Risk Management) is tasked with overseeing, assessing, and managing the model risk that may arise from these AI capabilities.<br><br>The AI validation team uses machine learning, statistical, and computational strategies to assess model risk.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Adeptmind - Machine Learning Engineer

Our platform helps online retailers bridge the gap between online and offline conversion rates. A bad search means a bad customer experience. Our technology uses deep learning and natural language processing to eliminate the “no results found” problem and show your customers what they want when they want it. Our results speak for themselves. No fancy jargon, just 100% accuracy every time.

At Myant, we are creating the world’s first expressive and continuous digital presence platform, enabled by integrating technology directly into clothing and augmented by other devices, wearables, and IOT. We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.

The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society however, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.

Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.

The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.

We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of fashion, electronics, software, and data science.

The Role:

We are seeking a highly motivated and versatile clinical scientist to join the Clinical Sciences team of the Science and Technology department. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to contribute to ideation, high-level design, and then testing of medical device prototypes based on e-textiles.

To be successful, the candidate must have a strong background in interacting and collecting data with real-world patients of diverse medical conditions, a perfect mastering of the scientific method and knowledge of the clinical trial methodologies (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods), and experience in the redaction of scientific reports and papers.

Experience with bio-signals and/or low-power wearable systems would be an important asset. Applicants should have a keen eye for solving problems that currently do not have well defined solutions and be able to rapidly design/prototype these ideas.

The successful candidate will join a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, textile experts, fashion designers and entrepreneurs to actively participate in the creation and optimization of new products and should be able to effectively work in multi-disciplinary teams.

Responsibilities:


Research, design, and test for the development of the next generation of smart textiles
Rapid ideation, implementation, and validation of biosignal measuring methods and/or devices
Work closely with a variety of people/teams with different disciplines (mechanical, firmware, data science, software, industrial design, textile, quality assurance, regulatory) and mutually educate each other to allow effective teamwork

Conducting research and designing protocols to study the attitude towards Myant product and any resulting behavior change
Integrating the Myant products in the care relationship
Capturing user perspectives from elderly, health care professionals, and other adults with and without health conditions
Write, edit, and amend protocol for internal and external testing, in accordance with company's quality control policy and with Research Ethics Board, respectively
Maintain fluid and productive relationships with partners (universities, start-ups, corporations)
Coordinating clinical studies in partnership with other institutions
Participating in Conferences, Webinars and sharing the experience with other teams
Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures and forms relevant to the Clinical Sciences team, in partnership with the regulatory team


Qualifications:


PhD in a field related to Clinical Sciences
Background in Physiotherapy/physical therapy/kinesiology or related discipline is an asset
2-5 years of clinical experience, particularly in geriatric and/or cardiology care
Strong analytical, problem solving, and leadership capabilities
Ability to contribute and work effectively in a fast-paced, multidisciplinary environment
Understanding of biosignals and signal processing techniques would be an important asset


What we offer at Myant:

We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.<br><br>Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.<br><br>The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.<br><br>We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of fashion, electronics, software, and data science.<br><br>The Role:<br><br>We are seeking a highly motivated and versatile clinical scientist to join the Clinical Sciences team of the Science and Technology department. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to contribute to ideation, high-level design, and then testing of medical device prototypes based on e-textiles.<br><br>To be successful, the candidate must have a strong background in interacting and collecting data with real-world patients of diverse medical conditions, a perfect mastering of the scientific method and knowledge of the clinical trial methodologies (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods), and experience in the redaction of scientific reports and papers.<br><br>Experience with bio-signals and/or low-power wearable systems would be an important asset. Applicants should have a keen eye for solving problems that currently do not have well defined solutions and be able to rapidly design/prototype these ideas.<br><br>The successful candidate will join a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, textile experts, fashion designers and entrepreneurs to actively participate in the creation and optimization of new products and should be able to effectively work in multi-disciplinary teams.<br><br>Responsibilities:<br><br><ul><li>Research, design, and test for the development of the next generation of smart textiles</li><li>Rapid ideation, implementation, and validation of biosignal measuring methods and/or devices</li><li>Work closely with a variety of people/teams with different disciplines (mechanical, firmware, data science, software, industrial design, textile, quality assurance, regulatory) and mutually educate each other to allow effective teamwork</li><li>Aid in the testing of prototypes and debug issues on the fly</li><li>Conducting research and designing protocols to study the attitude towards Myant product and any resulting behavior change</li><li>Integrating the Myant products in the care relationship</li><li>Capturing user perspectives from elderly, health care professionals, and other adults with and without health conditions</li><li>Write, edit, and amend protocol for internal and external testing, in accordance with company's quality control policy and with Research Ethics Board, respectively</li><li>Maintain fluid and productive relationships with partners (universities, start-ups, corporations)</li><li>Coordinating clinical studies in partnership with other institutions</li><li>Participating in Conferences, Webinars and sharing the experience with other teams</li><li>Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures and forms relevant to the Clinical Sciences team, in partnership with the regulatory team<br><br></li></ul>Qualifications:<br><br><ul><li>PhD in a field related to Clinical Sciences</li><li>Background in Physiotherapy/physical therapy/kinesiology or related discipline is an asset</li><li>2-5 years of clinical experience, particularly in geriatric and/or cardiology care</li><li>Strong analytical, problem solving, and leadership capabilities</li><li>Ability to contribute and work effectively in a fast-paced, multidisciplinary environment</li><li>Understanding of biosignals and signal processing techniques would be an important asset<br><br></li></ul>What we offer at Myant:<br><br><ul><li>Free SKIIN Employee Kit</li><li>Employee stock options</li><li>Paid Sick Days and Personal Days</li><li>Group Health Insurance Plan</li><li>Employee Referral Program</li><li>Corporate Events</li><li>Exposure working in one of the most innovative and forward-thinking start-ups that is passionate and dedicated towards the healthcare industry<br><br></li></ul>Powered by JazzHR<br><br>wnKHEe5mFt

At Myant, we are creating the world’s first expressive and continuous digital presence platform, enabled by integrating technology directly into clothing and augmented by other devices, wearables, and IOT. We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.

The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society however, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.

Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.

The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.

We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of fashion, electronics, software, and data science.

The Role:

We are seeking a highly motivated and versatile clinical scientist to join the Clinical Sciences team of the Science and Technology department. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to contribute to ideation, high-level design, and then testing of medical device prototypes based on e-textiles.

To be successful, the candidate must have a strong background in interacting and collecting data with real-world patients of diverse medical conditions, a perfect mastering of the scientific method and knowledge of the clinical trial methodologies (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods), and experience in the redaction of scientific reports and papers.

Experience with bio-signals and/or low-power wearable systems would be an important asset. Applicants should have a keen eye for solving problems that currently do not have well defined solutions and be able to rapidly design/prototype these ideas.

The successful candidate will join a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, textile experts, fashion designers and entrepreneurs to actively participate in the creation and optimization of new products and should be able to effectively work in multi-disciplinary teams.

Responsibilities:


Research, design, and test for the development of the next generation of smart textiles
Rapid ideation, implementation, and validation of biosignal measuring methods and/or devices
Work closely with a variety of people/teams with different disciplines (mechanical, firmware, data science, software, industrial design, textile, quality assurance, regulatory) and mutually educate each other to allow effective teamwork
Aid in the testing of prototypes and debug issues on the fly
Conducting research and designing protocols to study the attitude towards Myant product and any resulting behavior change
Integrating the Myant products in the care relationship
Capturing user perspectives from elderly, health care professionals, and other adults with and without health conditions
Write, edit, and amend protocol for internal and external testing, in accordance with company's quality control policy and with Research Ethics Board, respectively
Maintain fluid and productive relationships with partners (universities, start-ups, corporations)
Coordinating clinical studies in partnership with other institutions
Participating in Conferences, Webinars and sharing the experience with other teams
Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures and forms relevant to the Clinical Sciences team, in partnership with the regulatory team


Qualifications:


PhD in a field related to Clinical Sciences
Background in Physiotherapy/physical therapy/kinesiology or related discipline is an asset
2-5 years of clinical experience, particularly in geriatric and/or cardiology care
Strong analytical, problem solving, and leadership capabilities
Ability to contribute and work effectively in a fast-paced, multidisciplinary environment
Understanding of biosignals and signal processing techniques would be an important asset


What we offer at Myant:


Free SKIIN Employee Kit
Employee stock options
Paid Sick Days and Personal Days
Group Health Insurance Plan
Employee Referral Program
Corporate Events
Exposure working in one of the most innovative and forward-thinking start-ups that is passionate and dedicated towards the healthcare industry

Job Description

What is the opportunity?

RBC is a global leader in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the banking sector in order to create value for our clients, with capabilities ranging from LLM-powered digital banking, boosting ensembles in fraud detection and AML, voice assistants in customer service, to algorithmic trading in capital markets. A failure to effectively prepare for and manage emerging model risk related to AI would subject RBC to financial, regulatory, and reputational risks and, as a result, RBC would not be able to provide its clients with the best quality service. Therefore, the AI validation team within RBC’s Enterprise Model Risk Management (RBC Group Risk Management) is tasked with overseeing, assessing, and managing the model risk that may arise from these AI capabilities.

The AI validation team uses machine learning, statistical, and computational strategies to assess model risk. In doing so, RBC is able to identify model weaknesses early and enhance the reliability of production models across all lines of business.

What will you do?


Application: You will have the opportunity to work in any of the many areas we work in, across an even wider variety of business functions, such as the following:


Types of Models

Classification, regression, anomaly detection, natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning, recommendation systems, dimensionality reduction, Large Language Models including generative AI

Business Functions

Internal Audit, Cybersecurity, Fraud Management, Anti-Money Laundering, Insurance, Credit Risk, Technology Operations, Identity & Access Management, Human Resources


Validation: Your role is to challenge models and identify risks associated with their use – both conceptually and empirically. To that end, you will design and execute validation frameworks, exploring modelling considerations such as conceptual soundness, data processing, metric reproducibility & stability, benchmarking, robustness, uncertainty quantification, fairness, privacy, explainability, implementation controls and more. You will also have the freedom to explore ideas that interest you and build your own models and tools.
Research & Development: You will read research papers (established work and state-of-the-art) to enhance how our team validates models and contribute to our knowledge pool. You are encouraged to apply what you’ve learned to real-world problems, develop reusable software packages, and share your insights with others.
IT: You will collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to establish and promote best-practices related to MLOps, tooling and IT infrastructure.
Governance: You will work with model developers (data scientists, researchers, engineers) and business stakeholders to inventory applications of AI and machine learning at the bank, determine their materiality, and assess whether they require review.


What do you need to succeed?

Must-have


Passionate about learning and staying up-to-date with research and technology

          <strong>Job Summary<br><br></strong><strong>Job Description<br><br></strong><strong>What is the opportunity? <br><br></strong>RBC is a global leader in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the banking sector in order to create value for our clients, with capabilities ranging from LLM-powered digital banking, boosting ensembles in fraud detection and AML, voice assistants in customer service, to algorithmic trading in capital markets. A failure to effectively prepare for and manage emerging model risk related to AI would subject RBC to financial, regulatory, and reputational risks and, as a result, RBC would not be able to provide its clients with the best quality service. Therefore, the AI validation team within RBC’s Enterprise Model Risk Management (RBC Group Risk Management) is tasked with overseeing, assessing, and managing the model risk that may arise from these AI capabilities.<br><br>The AI validation team uses machine learning, statistical, and computational strategies to assess model risk. In doing so, RBC is able to identify model weaknesses early and enhance the reliability of production models across all lines of business.<br><br><strong>What will you do?<br><br></strong><ul><li>Application: You will have the opportunity to work in any of the many areas we work in, across an even wider variety of business functions, such as the following:<br><br></li></ul><strong>Types of Models<br><br></strong>Classification, regression, anomaly detection, natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning, recommendation systems, dimensionality reduction, Large Language Models including generative AI<br><br><strong>Business Functions<br><br></strong>Internal Audit, Cybersecurity, Fraud Management, Anti-Money Laundering, Insurance, Credit Risk, Technology Operations, Identity &amp; Access Management, Human Resources<br><br><ul><li>Validation: Your role is to challenge models and identify risks associated with their use – both conceptually and empirically. To that end, you will design and execute validation frameworks, exploring modelling considerations such as conceptual soundness, data processing, metric reproducibility &amp; stability, benchmarking, robustness, uncertainty quantification, fairness, privacy, explainability, implementation controls and more. You will also have the freedom to explore ideas that interest you and build your own models and tools.</li><li>Research &amp; Development: You will read research papers (established work and state-of-the-art) to enhance how our team validates models and contribute to our knowledge pool. You are encouraged to apply what you’ve learned to real-world problems, develop reusable software packages, and share your insights with others.</li><li>IT: You will collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to establish and promote best-practices related to MLOps, tooling and IT infrastructure.</li><li>Governance: You will work with model developers (data scientists, researchers, engineers) and business stakeholders to inventory applications of AI and machine learning at the bank, determine their materiality, and assess whether they require review.<br><br></li></ul><strong>What do you need to succeed?<br><br></strong><strong>Must-have<br><br></strong><ul><li>Passionate about learning and staying up-to-date with research and technology</li><li>Strong communication and interpersonal skills</li><li>Progress towards a PhD or Master’s degree in Statistics, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Econometrics, Engineering, Quantitative Finance, or a related quantitative field</li><li>Proficient programming skills in Python or a similar language; you should already be comfortable with writing research experiments and be willing to learn how to write clean code.</li><li>Familiarity with popular machine learning frameworks and libraries<br><br></li></ul><strong>Nice-to-have<br><br></strong><ul><li>A risk-oriented mindset: You are curious about the “how” as well as the “why""</li><li>Publication or prior research experience (applied or fundamental)</li><li>Experience with version control systems</li><li>Comfortable with command line tools<br><br></li></ul><strong>What’s in it for you?<br><br></strong>As a team, we thrive on the challenge to be our best, encourage progressive thinking for continued growth, and collaborate with one another to deliver trusted advice to help our clients thrive and our communities prosper.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.<br><br>A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office.

This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.<br><br>Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Float is one of Canada's fastest growing companies and Top Startups, serving Canadian businesses with our innovative smart corporate card and spend management solution. Float's team is customer-obsessed, passionate, vibrant, and entrepreneurial, and includes executives from Uber, Shopify, Ritual, and many other incredible tech companies!

At Float, everyone is an owner, bringing their unique perspective to our team and product. Your voice is important, and we take having a culture based on feedback seriously. We openly share our thoughts, feedback, and differing opinions so we can continue to improve. We do our best to keep our decision making decentralized so that all team members contribute.

Our Product

Float empowers companies and teams with smart financial products, helping them achieve their most ambitious goals. We're making finance more accessible and saving companies and their teams time and money, while disrupting the multi-trillion dollar global B2B finance industry. Backed by some of the best venture capital investors in the world, including Tiger Global, Golden Ventures, and Susa Ventures, we're looking for pioneers to help us achieve our vision.

About The Senior Data Scientist Role

We're looking for an experienced Data Scientist to play a foundational role in shaping Float's data science capabilities, strategies and to continue to build out our Data Science team.

Requirements

As a Senior Data Scientist at Float:


You'll develop a data strategy that is aligned to Float's strategy, identify key metrics, which data needs to be collected, and set the processes for how data will be stored, cleaned, and maintained at Float
You'll build upon Float's data infrastructure and determine which technologies and tools the company should use for its data science activities
You'll build and maintain our data warehouse, using DBT to transform our data unlocking deeper analytics and empowering those outside the data team to use data in their day-to-day
You'll work closely with the product team to build data-led products
You'll analyze large-scale, complex datasets to extract meaningful insights and drive decision-making
You'll evaluate the performance of existing models and propose enhancements to improve accuracy, efficiency, and scalability
You'll work closely with all teams across Float to understand their data needs and provide solutions



You'll be great in this role if:


You're an owner. You love a challenge, and take great satisfaction in tackling them head on. You love being a pioneer and taking on any task (big or small) and driving it through to completion. You are also comfortable making independent decisions and following your instincts to be able to move quickly
You're able to explain complex data in simple terms. As you'll be communicating your findings to different stakeholders, your ability to present data in an understandable way is vital
You have solid technical skills. Strong skills in data modeling, data structures, data mining, predictive modeling and analysis tools (such as Python, SQL, DBT), and data visualization tools, are crucial. Understanding of machine learning algorithms and statistics is an asset
You understand the business context. You'll be more effective if you understand not just how to work with data, but also why you're working with it - i.e., how it will impact the business and drive decisions
You're comfortable with a fast-paced environment. Float is a dynamic environment and things can change quickly. You should be flexible and able to adapt to changes as they occur
You can balance attention to detail and strategic thinking. While it's important to delve into the details of your data, it's equally important to keep the big picture in mind
You ruthlessly prioritize. You will have multiple responsibilities and projects. Being able to effectively manage your workload and meet deadlines is crucial
You have an experimental mindset. The ability to design and analyze experiments will be very helpful in optimizing products and making business decisions
You're eager to continue your own learning. Scrappy and voracious, you want to know the ‘why' behind every answer. You love to have healthy debates with fellow developers and colleagues about the product



This role won't be a fit if:


You're not extremely detail oriented
You are not open to a hybrid role (based in Toronto)
You aren't a self-starter and don't like to work independently
You're not comfortable wearing multiple hats
You don't like change and adapting to new ways of doing things
You aren't comfortable with ambiguity
You aren't able to translate technical jargon into simple language
You lack patience for iterative work
You want detailed to-dos for your tasks and projects
You're not keen on learning new things
You don't have strong stakeholder management skills
You don't like regular feedback on your work


Don't meet every single requirement? If you're excited about this role, and you strongly align with our values but your past experience doesn't align perfectly, we encourage you to apply anyway. You may be the right candidate for this, or other future positions.

At Myant, we are creating the world’s first expressive and continuous digital presence platform, enabled by integrating technology directly into clothing and augmented by other devices, wearables, and IOT. We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.

The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society however, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.

Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.

The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.

We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of fashion, electronics, software, and data science.

The Role:

We are seeking a highly motivated and versatile clinical scientist to join the Clinical Sciences team of the Science and Technology department. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to contribute to ideation, high-level design, and then testing of medical device prototypes based on e-textiles.

To be successful, the candidate must have a strong background in interacting and collecting data with real-world patients of diverse medical conditions, a perfect mastering of the scientific method and knowledge of the clinical trial methodologies (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods), and experience in the redaction of scientific reports and papers.

Experience with bio-signals and/or low-power wearable systems would be an important asset. Applicants should have a keen eye for solving problems that currently do not have well defined solutions and be able to rapidly design/prototype these ideas.

The successful candidate will join a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, textile experts, fashion designers and entrepreneurs to actively participate in the creation and optimization of new products and should be able to effectively work in multi-disciplinary teams.

Responsibilities:


Research, design, and test for the development of the next generation of smart textiles
Rapid ideation, implementation, and validation of biosignal measuring methods and/or devices
Work closely with a variety of people/teams with different disciplines (mechanical, firmware, data science, software, industrial design, textile, quality assurance, regulatory) and mutually educate each other to allow effective teamwork
Aid in the testing of prototypes and debug issues on the fly
Conducting research and designing protocols to study the attitude towards Myant product and any resulting behavior change
Integrating the Myant products in the care relationship
Capturing user perspectives from elderly, health care professionals, and other adults with and without health conditions
Write, edit, and amend protocol for internal and external testing, in accordance with company's quality control policy and with Research Ethics Board, respectively
Maintain fluid and productive relationships with partners (universities, start-ups, corporations)
Coordinating clinical studies in partnership with other institutions
Participating in Conferences, Webinars and sharing the experience with other teams
Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures and forms relevant to the Clinical Sciences team, in partnership with the regulatory team


Qualifications:


PhD in a field related to Clinical Sciences
Background in Physiotherapy/physical therapy/kinesiology or related discipline is an asset
2-5 years of clinical experience, particularly in geriatric and/or cardiology care
Strong analytical, problem solving, and leadership capabilities
Ability to contribute and work effectively in a fast-paced, multidisciplinary environment
Understanding of biosignals and signal processing techniques would be an important asset


What we offer at Myant:


Free SKIIN Employee Kit
Employee stock options
Paid Sick Days and Personal Days
Group Health Insurance Plan
Employee Referral Program
Corporate Events
Exposure working in one of the most innovative and forward-thinking start-ups that is passionate and dedicated towards the healthcare industry

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Payment Intelligence ML organization optimizes each of the billions of dollars of transactions processed by Stripe annually on behalf of our customers, maximizing successful transactions while minimizing payment costs and fraud. We leverage ML to serve real-time predictions as part of Stripe’s payment infrastructure and risk controls. We own products like Radar, Adaptive Acceptance, and Identity end-to-end, operating lightning fast world-scale services and cutting-edge ML models.

What you’ll do

We are looking for Machine Learning Engineers to own the end-to-end lifecycle of applied ML model development and deployment in service of consumer facing products like Radar, Adaptive Acceptance, and Identity. You will work closely with software engineers, machine learning engineers (MLE), data scientists (DS), and ML platform infrastructure teams to design, build, deploy, and operate Stripe’s ML-powered payment decisioning systems, including improving existing ML models and developing new ML solutions.

Responsibilities


Design and deploy new models using tools (such as Spark, Presto, XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch) and iteratively improve verification and fraud models to protect millions of users from fraud
Envision and develop new models for fraud detection i.e work with large payment datasets to find creative new methods of detecting and deterring fraudulent behavior.
Propose new feature ideas and design real-time data pipelines to incorporate them into our models.
Integrate new signals into ML pipelines, derive new ML features, and build workflows to make this process fast
Integrate new models and behaviors into Stripe’s core payment flow
Collaborate and execute projects cross-functionally with the data science, product management, infrastructure, and risk teams
Ensure engineering outcomes meet or exceed established standards of excellence in code quality, system design, and scalability
Mentor engineers earlier in their technical careers to help them grow
Propose and implement innovative product ideas to reduce costs and combat fraud at Stripe



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Over 3+ years industry experience building machine learning applications in large scale distributed systems.
2+ year of experience working within a team responsible for developing, managing, and optimizing ML models or ML infrastructure
Experience designing and training machine learning models to solve critical business problems
Experience performing analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to model performance and business metrics



Preferred Qualifications


An advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. stats, physics, computer science)
Proven track record of building and deploying machine learning systems that have effectively solved critical business problems
Experience in adversarial domains like Payments, Fraud, Trust, or Safety
Experience working in Python, Java and / or Ruby codebases
Experience in software engineering in a production environment.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $173,100 - $316,800. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

It does not matter which programming language is your primary and we accept engineers with Python (however, you must be willing to work using Swift). Previous Swift experience is not required.

Accepted Locations

We are accepting applicants from the US, Canada, and most countries in LATAM and Europe. We are accepting some countries in Africa and Asia. For the full list of accepted locations, click here. This work is 100% remote.

Loom Video

Our Founder/CEO, Gabe Greenberg, created a more in depth Loom video that we highly recommend you watch! Check it out here: https://www.loom.com/share/5a8972c7fbbf46aaa3f389b2b6391c40

Job Overview

We are currently seeking Developers for project-specific roles focused on RLHF. This role will play a key part in our reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) initiatives, contributing to cutting-edge projects.

You’ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for for the worlds most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the biggest players in the AI/LLM space today. We are seeking software engineers with 4+ years of experience to train AI large language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!

What Will I Be Doing?


Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""which piece of Python code is better?"" to ""make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterwards to make it faster""


Contract Length


This project is expected to last until the end of September and you'll be able to continue to work on other projects (though likely not in Swift).
You can end the contract at any time.


Flexible Schedules


Developers can set their own hours - ideal candidates will be interested in spending 15+ hours a week. They will be with teams, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but incredibly flexible on working hours.
Take a 3 hour lunch, no problem. You are paid according to time spent on the platform, which is calculated in the coding exercises, as opposed to tracking your own hours.


Compensation


US: $50 /hr
Brazil: $28.70/hr
Egypt: $22.05/hr
Phillipines: $25.55/hr
All other countries: $35/hr
Expectations are 15+ hours per week however there is no upper limit. We have engineers working 20-40 hrs per week and some that are working 40+ hours per week. You can work as much as you want to. You'll get paid on a weekly basis. You get paid per hour of work done on the platform.


Interview Process

We've created a 3.5 hour screening and onboarding process to join as a Software Engineer for AI Training Data which can be accomplished in 1 week or less. We purposely perform most of these steps asynchronously because most of the RLHF work is async and self guided. After you apply, if you look like a good fit we'll provide you access to the G2i dashboard to go through this simple screening process.

Step 1: Learn in depth about the role (35 min)

Step 2: Perform a simple RLHF code review (35 min)

Step 3: Receive platform credentials, pass ID verification (5 min), and choose your project (30 min).

Step 4: Perform a production level RLHF task (75 min) ""aka the final interview""

Join us: Based on your final interview, you'll will put you on the right difficulty RLHF project
