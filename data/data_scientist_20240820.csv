About Us

mediaire was founded in 2018 by Dr. Andreas Lemke and Dr. Jörg Döpfert – both physicists with a background in MRI physics.

The real founding history, however, dates back to 2009 when the scientific paths of Andreas and Jörg crossed several times with the renowned radiologist Prof. Henrik Michaely. Coming from different backgrounds and discovering that each had the same goal, the idea of a scientifically and economically successful high-tech product took shape – a software powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that allows highly efficient analysis of medical imaging data in Radiology to support radiologists in their daily routine.

About the Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has got Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Develop and automate forecasting models to plan the capacity of the support centers across different locations.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track scheduling efficiency, occupancy rates, and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building forecasting models & time series analysis (Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters or similar).
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in Cost Analysis, What-if Scenario Analysis, Capacity planning, and Workforce Management is nice to have but not mandatory.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

About Merchant Group at Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business. Their core mission is to provide merchants with self-service tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use.

About The Merchant Analytics Team

Merchant Analytics is an embedded analytics function within the Merchant Group. The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

LLMs: Experience with training or fine-tuning AI models (LLMs) is a plus

Common working hours are 12pm to 5pm CET, with the rest of your working time being flexible so you can work in a style that suits you best (early riser or a night owl)

The team's purpose is to provide high quality, independent evidence to inform strategic decisions on science and technology.

This Data Scientist role sits within the Science Capability Analysis (SCAN) team within TIFF. The SCAN team seeks to identify the areas of benign neglect in the UK S&T landscape. As an example, a Covid-19 vaccine was created in the UK but there was no manufacturing capability. This issue was likely known to those in industry but not considered as part of a set of risks. Combining analysis of a wide range of data and information, you will work collaboratively to develop a register of issues in S&T capability areas requiring government-led or -initiated intervention, and produce assessments, reports and data on these issues to inform policy decisions. These assessments will help Government understand new and emerging risks and opportunities, and support strategic decision making within the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), the Office for Science and Technology Strategy (OSTS) and other departments across government.

We are fully committed to being an inclusive employer and ensuring equal opportunities. We are keen to make our workforce as diverse as possible and recognise how important inclusivity is to achieve the best outcomes. We hope to attract applications from all underrepresented groups.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.

Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is to maximise business impact within one of many business areas. You will help answer questions like:



Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?



The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Requirements



A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)
Experience conducting A/B experiments
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed.

About Us

Climate X is a purpose-driven climate adaptation data company set to revolutionise how the world manages assets, property, and infrastructure. 

We apply cutting-edge, peer-reviewed science to help prevent the worst impacts of climate change. We combine climate projections, remote sensing observations, and modelling to project the frequency and severity of physical climate risks such as floods, subsidence, storms, etc.

Our SaaS platform lets financial institutions and real estate firms look at future climate pathways to:


help identify how property/company assets could be damaged by severe weather events and
what that damage might do to the asset valuations.
become more resilient to climate change and make smarter investment and lending decisions.


We advocate diversity with our founders, team, and investors from various backgrounds.

We're not building just a team but a place of innovation where problem solving, and fun coexist to address the most significant challenge our society is facing now. 

The impact you'll own

As a Data Scientist at Climate X, you will join an interdisciplinary team of other Data Scientists, Climate Scientists and Geospatial experts, collaborating closely with our Engineering and Product teams to deliver impactful products to our clients.

This role will support our NLP model, a core product within the business. This will involve developing an existing code base, research time for exploring new techniques and algorithms, fine-tuning LLM models on domain-specific datasets to enhance the performance of our existing model, perform statistical analysis and techniques for model evaluation, analyse text data to extract meaningful insights and trends and create visualizations to communicate findings and facilitate understanding of the model across the business and our clients.

Essential Skills


Experience in a commercial Data Science role with strong understanding of machine learning algorithms and techniques (e.g., regression, classification, clustering), using ML packages in Python (such as sklearn, spaCy, NumPy, SciPy or others).
Experience with version control systems like Git for managing code changes and collaborating with team members. Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines (e.g. GitHub Actions) is a plus.
Experience with data visualisation tools and libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Power BI).
Experience with cloud services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure) for data storage and processing.
Ability to work with cross-functional teams using strong problem-solving skills and share insights to diverse audiences.


Nice to have


Experience with web scraping using Python (such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, Requests or others) is a plus.
Exposure to MLOps frameworks (such as MLFlow, Weights and Biases).
Knowledge of the financial services or real estate domain from a climate risk perspective, to inform a basic understanding of where data science is being applied, allowing for better context and interpretation of results.
Experience with processing and analysing geospatial data using Python (geopandas, GDAL, etc.) and/or other GIS software (such as QGIS) is a plus.

Collaborating with cross-functional technology teams to gather requirements and ensure the solutions align with business objectives
Helping integrate the team’s solutions (including GenAI) into existing systems and platforms to provide seamless user experiences and scale adoption.
Actively participating in code reviews, experiment design and tooling decisions to help drive the team’s velocity and quality
Helping build data and machine learning expertise within the business through knowledge sharing

Our dazzle of zebras is a force to be reckoned with - they possess unwavering determination, take decisive action, push boundaries with innovative ideas, and thrive in an environment that offers autonomy, trust, and accountability to deliver exceptional outcomes.

The skills crisis is a colossal challenge, one that is expected to have a greater economic impact than the COVID-19 pandemic. The shortage of skilled workers is leaving millions of positions unfilled, and this crisis has been deemed by the World Economic Forum as one of the biggest challenges of our time, second only to climate change.

The world’s largest companies are transforming into skills-based organisations to survive, but most are struggling to do so without the proper tools. That's where we come in - we have built an innovative platform for workforce management that empowers companies to make skill-based decisions and thrive.

Our existing clients have already witnessed the positive impact that skill-based decision-making has on organisational performance, diversity, culture, and management insight. We have several FTSE100 customers and have recently secured £7.7 million in Series A funding.

We are now assembling the right team to help us become the leader in the multi-billion dollar skill-based workforce planning market. Our mission is clear and ambitious - we will unite 10 million people with opportunities at the world’s leading employers based on skills by 2030. In doing so, we will be driving a quarter of all people-decisions and will be making a significant contribution towards solving the skills crisis. We’d love you to join us and make a difference that will shape the future for generations to come!

The Challenge

As a Junior AI Engineer at Spotted Zebra, you will work to deliver innovative AI-driven features that directly contribute to our mission of solving the global skills crisis. This will involve working with Large Language Models (LLMs) as well as traditional Natural Language Processing techniques to deliver accurate, reliable, and explainable solutions that address our clients' needs.

This role will allow you to holistically develop your data science skill set, including breaking down customer problems with real-world data, building preprocessing pipelines, deepening your understanding of the latest LLM architectures, and developing tools that have immediate business impact. You will work with the Lead AI Engineer to integrate these models with our existing systems, and play a critical role in making AI central to our product offerings.

Under the guidance of the Lead AI Engineer, you will navigate the complexities of optimising model performance, ensuring precision and robustness in AI outputs, and maintaining the lifecycle of AI models from development to production. Success in this role means not only developing cutting-edge AI solutions but also ensuring these solutions effectively solve our clients' problems, making AI a cornerstone of our product's value proposition. Your work will have a direct impact on improving skill based organisations, thereby helping millions of people connect with opportunities at leading employers.

The Team

As a Junior AI Engineer, you will report directly to the Lead AI Engineer. In this role, you will be aligned with a squad and collaborate closely with our Full Stack Engineers, Product Managers, and Design teams to ensure the seamless integration of AI-driven solutions into our platform. Your brief will initially reside around implementing best practices and processes around prompt engineering for leading LLMs and our own fine tuned LLMs.

Who are we and why do we do what we do?

We are a data and payments company on a mission! We’re a group of developers, financial experts, and optimists who share a vision for improving the financial wellness of people, their businesses, and their communities.

We started this company with the aim of changing how the industry used and viewed data. As architects of Open Banking, Open Finance, and Open Data, we strive to be a force for good — changing the status quo of how businesses interact with people. We strive to serve the whole population through every change in their finances.

We do this by powering businesses through our APIs and Personal Finance Tech solutions as well as our own personal financial management app for consumers.

We can only do that by being an inclusive and diverse organisation. We invest in our people, and enjoy an environment focused on innovation, collaboration and openness.

What do we offer?

We champion flexibility, and we trust and respect our employees to deliver results in a way that best suits them, working around their own lives and commitments.

We live and breathe a fantastic culture of remote working and you may perform your duties predominantly from your home. However, the heart of Moneyhub is in Bristol and from time to time you will be required to attend company meet ups. Your role may require you to attend client meetings, networking events or group training sessions. You may also be required to work at such other place or places as we may reasonably require from time to time. As a minimum, you will be required to attend a quarterly All Team Away Day at a location of our choice (including overseas).

As well as a truly flexible approach, we also offer a fantastic range of benefits, including:

Remote working - with quarterly away days, regular team meeting and face to face client meetings as required.

10% contribution towards your Pension from your very first day with us;

25 days of holiday (plus bank hols), rising to 30 days after two years;

Choose to take your entitlement to UK bank holidays at other times based on your own days of significance;

Private medical insurance, including cover for pre-existing conditions, plus dental and optical benefit;

Six week Moneyhubber Family Pay when you become a new parent;

Permanent health insurance and life cover - much greater than the industry standard (death in service);

Employee assistance programme;

Professional development support, with dedicated allowance of time and money;

Life event leave;

Cycle to work scheme;

EV Salary sacrifice scheme;

£750 towards professional memberships

Remote working benefits, including work from almost anywhere, access to co-working spaces and support for your home office set-up

High spec laptop

Requirements

Sounds great right? What will you be doing?

The Data Science capability at Moneyhub generates value from a rich repository of data sources. Its function is critical to the day-to-day running of the business, and it also spearheads the development of novel ideas to exploit new commercial opportunities.

You Can Expect To Work On


The Machine Learning based transaction categorisation engine that underpins the budgeting capabilities of the app and affordability checking, e.g. for mortgages.

Job Description

What is the opportunity?

RBC is a global leader in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the banking sector in order to create value for our clients, with capabilities ranging from LLM-powered digital banking, boosting ensembles in fraud detection and AML, voice assistants in customer service, to algorithmic trading in capital markets. A failure to effectively prepare for and manage emerging model risk related to AI would subject RBC to financial, regulatory, and reputational risks and, as a result, RBC would not be able to provide its clients with the best quality service. Therefore, the AI validation team within RBC’s Enterprise Model Risk Management (RBC Group Risk Management) is tasked with overseeing, assessing, and managing the model risk that may arise from these AI capabilities.

The AI validation team uses machine learning, statistical, and computational strategies to assess model risk. In doing so, RBC is able to identify model weaknesses early and enhance the reliability of production models across all lines of business.

What will you do?


Application: You will have the opportunity to work in any of the many areas we work in, across an even wider variety of business functions, such as the following:


Types of Models

Classification, regression, anomaly detection, natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning, recommendation systems, dimensionality reduction, Large Language Models including generative AI

Business Functions

Internal Audit, Cybersecurity, Fraud Management, Anti-Money Laundering, Insurance, Credit Risk, Technology Operations, Identity & Access Management, Human Resources


Validation: Your role is to challenge models and identify risks associated with their use – both conceptually and empirically. To that end, you will design and execute validation frameworks, exploring modelling considerations such as conceptual soundness, data processing, metric reproducibility & stability, benchmarking, robustness, uncertainty quantification, fairness, privacy, explainability, implementation controls and more. You will also have the freedom to explore ideas that interest you and build your own models and tools.
Research & Development: You will read research papers (established work and state-of-the-art) to enhance how our team validates models and contribute to our knowledge pool. You are encouraged to apply what you’ve learned to real-world problems, develop reusable software packages, and share your insights with others.
IT: You will collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to establish and promote best-practices related to MLOps, tooling and IT infrastructure.
Governance: You will work with model developers (data scientists, researchers, engineers) and business stakeholders to inventory applications of AI and machine learning at the bank, determine their materiality, and assess whether they require review.


What do you need to succeed?

Must-have


Passionate about learning and staying up-to-date with research and technology
Strong communication and interpersonal skills
Progress towards a PhD or Master’s degree in Statistics, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Econometrics, Engineering, Quantitative Finance, or a related quantitative field
Proficient programming skills in Python or a similar language; you should already be comfortable with writing research experiments and be willing to learn how to write clean code.
Familiarity with popular machine learning frameworks and libraries


Nice-to-have


A risk-oriented mindset: You are curious about the “how” as well as the “why""
Publication or prior research experience (applied or fundamental)
Experience with version control systems
Comfortable with command line tools


What’s in it for you?

As a team, we thrive on the challenge to be our best, encourage progressive thinking for continued growth, and collaborate with one another to deliver trusted advice to help our clients thrive and our communities prosper. We respect and care about all of our team members and support one another in reaching our fullest potential.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

At Myant, we are creating the world’s first expressive and continuous digital presence platform, enabled by integrating technology directly into clothing and augmented by other devices, wearables, and IOT. We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.

The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society however, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.

Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.

The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.

We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of fashion, electronics, software, and data science.

          About Us:<br><br>At Myant, we are creating the world’s first expressive and continuous digital presence platform, enabled by integrating technology directly into clothing and augmented by other devices, wearables, and IOT. We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.<br><br>The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society however, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.<br><br>Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.<br><br>The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.<br><br>We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of fashion, electronics, software, and data science.<br><br>The Role:<br><br>We are seeking a highly motivated and versatile clinical scientist to join the Clinical Sciences team of the Science and Technology department.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The Payment Intelligence ML organization optimizes each of the billions of dollars of transactions processed by Stripe annually on behalf of our customers, maximizing successful transactions while minimizing payment costs and fraud. We leverage ML to serve real-time predictions as part of Stripe’s payment infrastructure and risk controls. We own products like Radar, Adaptive Acceptance, and Identity end-to-end, operating lightning fast world-scale services and cutting-edge ML models.

What you’ll do

We are looking for Machine Learning Engineers to own the end-to-end lifecycle of applied ML model development and deployment in service of consumer facing products like Radar, Adaptive Acceptance, and Identity. You will work closely with software engineers, machine learning engineers (MLE), data scientists (DS), and ML platform infrastructure teams to design, build, deploy, and operate Stripe’s ML-powered payment decisioning systems, including improving existing ML models and developing new ML solutions.

Responsibilities


Design and deploy new models using tools (such as Spark, Presto, XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch) and iteratively improve verification and fraud models to protect millions of users from fraud
Envision and develop new models for fraud detection i.e work with large payment datasets to find creative new methods of detecting and deterring fraudulent behavior.
Propose new feature ideas and design real-time data pipelines to incorporate them into our models.
Integrate new signals into ML pipelines, derive new ML features, and build workflows to make this process fast
Integrate new models and behaviors into Stripe’s core payment flow
Collaborate and execute projects cross-functionally with the data science, product management, infrastructure, and risk teams
Ensure engineering outcomes meet or exceed established standards of excellence in code quality, system design, and scalability
Mentor engineers earlier in their technical careers to help them grow
Propose and implement innovative product ideas to reduce costs and combat fraud at Stripe



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Over 3+ years industry experience building machine learning applications in large scale distributed systems.
2+ year of experience working within a team responsible for developing, managing, and optimizing ML models or ML infrastructure
Experience designing and training machine learning models to solve critical business problems
Experience performing analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to model performance and business metrics



Preferred Qualifications


An advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. stats, physics, computer science)
Proven track record of building and deploying machine learning systems that have effectively solved critical business problems
Experience in adversarial domains like Payments, Fraud, Trust, or Safety
Experience working in Python, Java and / or Ruby codebases
Experience in software engineering in a production environment.



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $173,100 - $316,800. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Working with us

How do we do things at Capital One Canada? We listen — to our people, and to our customers. We change with the times and have adopted a flexible hybrid model (remote and/or in-office). A flexible hybrid working model is one that creates the opportunity to match the work that we do to the environment that best supports that work. Associates working in the hybrid model are expected to come into the office 3 days a week across Tuesdays and Thursdays, reserving Mondays and Fridays as company-wide virtual days. As was true before the pandemic, expectations of being in the office will be balanced with personal life flexibility. We recognize that everyone has a unique working pattern so we’re open to discussing flexible working arrangements that will best accommodate you.

At Capital One we’re committed to diversity, inclusion and belonging . We strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and inclusive behaviours are embedded in everything we do to positively impact associates. Strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and to help challenge the status quo and create the best outcomes for everyone.

Our environment is creative and filled with teams that are passionate about the dynamic work they're doing. We're ahead of other banks in tech and we want to keep it that way.

As a Data Scientist co-op, you will work with cross-functional teams to leverage model solutions to solve complex business problems. As a data savvy individual, you will use your skills to identify the best algorithm or model to solve the problem at hand. You will have autonomy to take ownership and lead an end to end project, from problem identification to solution deployment.
