We believe that our youth deserve the very best care, not only for their physical health but also their mental health. Through an integrated community-centered care approach, our skilled clinical team delivers exceptional virtual and in-person care across a wide range of specialties. If you're excited to work for a mission-driven company that values compassion, dedication, and a holistic approach to care, Blackbird Health is a great place to advance your career.

Act as a curator of data by defining, instrumenting, and tracking necessary analytics of our products by working cross functionally with engineering and product teams.
Build self-service systems to enable others in the organization to leverage your work.
Analyze and perform statistical analysis on data that underlies product experiments.
Build models to help decision makers understand customer behaviors and segmentation
You stay focused on what’s best for the company – sometimes that requires being flexible, other times it requires being steadfast.

We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe’s mission is to build the economic infrastructure for the internet. Risk Engineering brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s financial and regulatory risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. We build ML and backend systems to catch fraudsters, understand users’ cash flow and financial health, and ensure Stripe’s users are compliant with regulatory and financial partner requirements. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from financial losses that can put Stripe’s business at risk.

The Risk group consists of machine learning, backend, and full stack engineers who tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We are undertaking several new efforts, where you can have an outsized impact on the architecture, implementation, and design choices behind these systems.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching models
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly reduce Stripe’s financial losses
Building systems that evaluate businesses for risk and take appropriate actions
Working with our partner teams to launch new policies that directly impact Stripe’s bottom line
Helping engineers across the company to develop technologies for scaling our infrastructure
Debugging production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 2 years of industry experience in training ML models
Enjoy and have experience shipping ML models in a large-scale production environment
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


Have experience in Python, Scala (Spark), or Ruby



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Come take off with us!

The yearly total compensation for this senior position ranges from 110 000$ to 300 000$ USD. Compensation will be determined by candidates' relevant qualifications, knowledge, skills and work experience. Total compensation will include a solid base salary and will also include equity (options / RSUs), sign-on bonus and other potential incentives.

And so for that to happen, chargers need to be available where people naturally spend their days. To bring this vision to life and accelerate it as fast as possible, we have recently secured €150M from Antin Infrastructure Partners, one of the world's largest investment funds.

⭐Our Mission is as simple as ambitious - Accelerate Sustainable Mobility. And we do it by investing, installing, and operating EV chargers with an innovative business model akin to an Infra and Tech scale-up. So in a nutshell, we help businesses find the right charging solution that fits their customers' needs, and today we’ve joined forces with more than 1,200 partners across Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Poland, where we have more than 2,200 contracted locations.

⭐Our Values: We are partner obsessed and create bespoke solutions to better serve their customers. We love the challenge of making EV charging simpler, readily available, and integrated with varied retail and service experiences.

🚀 Finally, we are all about growing - our network, partner businesses, teams' professional development but mostly the EV ecosystem. So that sustainable mobility becomes a reality for all as fast as possible.

At the end of the day we believe that everything we are and all we want to be, is and will be due to our Team, composed by a collective of creative thinkers and doers with backgrounds from McKinsey, UBS Investment Banking, Oliver Wyman, or Burger King to people responsible for scaling Uber, Glovo, and Lime at their earliest stages.

Jouw high-end rapporten bereiken honderden collega's en klanten binnen de Benelux. Dit vereist doorzettingsvermogen en de drive om te blijven groeien. Als Data Scientist is dit jouw rol bij DHL.







Dit ga je doen

Als Data Scientist speel je een cruciale rol in het ontwikkelen en implementeren van data gestuurde analyses. Deze analyses, gebaseerd op complexe datasets, bieden waardevolle inzichten voor DHL. Dit omvat het verwerken van grote hoeveelheden ongestructureerde data uit verschillende bronnen om DHL en haar klanten beter te dienen.

Je werkt met de nieuwste technologieën, zoals Azure Databricks, om de meest relevante waarden te presenteren aan afdelingen zoals Operations, Finance en Customer Service. Je werkt volgens de principes van Agile ontwikkeling aan uiteenlopende projecten binnen het gehele bedrijf. Jij bouwt het, jij runt het, jij bent verantwoordelijk! Je besteedt minimaal 32 uur per week aan:




Het analyseren van data, het identificeren van patronen en trends, en het presenteren van bevindingen aan belanghebbenden.
Samenwerken met teams binnen IT/Digital om de beste data gestuurde oplossingen voor te stellen.
Ondersteunen bij het beantwoorden van strategische en operationele vraagstukken door het ontwikkelen van datagestuurde analyses.




Jouw nieuwe werkplek

Je werkt op het hoofdkantoor van DHL eCommerce in Utrecht. Als Data Scientist werk je samen met ingenieurs, producteigenaren en andere wetenschappers in een Scrum-team. Naast je directe collega's heb je ook contact met andere teams en afdelingen. De afdeling Digital en IT, waar je voor werkt, bestaat nu uit 250 collega's.




We luisteren altijd naar wat je te zeggen hebt. Hoe meer perspectieven en meningen we horen, hoe beter we allemaal worden. Dat is waarom onze organisatie het Great Place to Work-certificaat heeft ontvangen, gebaseerd op feedback van medewerkers.




Dit ben jij

Het bouwen aan de toekomst van levering geeft je energie. Elke keer als je een DHL-van voorbij ziet komen, voel je een gevoel van trots - en terecht, want jij draagt bij aan de ontwikkeling ervan. Je bent een vastberaden individu dat goed gedijt in een teamomgeving. Bij DHL werk je met de nieuwste technieken aan grote en schaalbare platformen - een omgeving die je als geen ander aanspreekt.




Verder heb je:

Minimaal een hbo- of universitair werk- en denkniveau.
Minimaal 5 jaar ervaring in een soortgelijke functie.
Sterke programmeervaardigheden, bij voorkeur in Scala.
Ervaring met Spark, CI/CD, Terraform en Kafka.
De wil en nieuwsgierigheid om te werken met event-driven architecture.
Bekendheid met cloud-based oplossingen zoals Azure.




Dit krijg jij

Een baan om trots op te zijn! En niet zomaar een baan, wij gebruiken liever het woord carrière. Als Data Scientist wil jij je namelijk blijven ontwikkelen!




Voor de functie van Data Scientist kan jij rekenen op:

Een salaris tussen € 4.000,- en € 5.500,- bruto op basis van 40 uur, gebaseerd op je kennis en ervaring;
Een bonusregeling van 5%;
Standaard 23 vakantiedagen en 8% vakantiegeld;
Cao a la carte, een budget naar keuze voor extra salaris of vakantiedagen (4,5 dagen per jaar);
Reiskostenvergoeding tot 30 kilometer per enkele reis;
Pensioenregeling;
De mogelijkheid om hybride te werken;
Vanaf dag één uitgebreide opleidings- en trainingsmogelijkheden;
Kansen en mogelijkheden voor ontwikkeling en doorgroei, zowel nationaal- als internationaal!







De toekomst van bezorgen is geel-rood

DHL eCommerce is het meest toonaangevende logistiek bedrijf ter wereld. Dat klinkt misschien opschepperig, maar zo bedoelen we het niet: we zien het namelijk niet als een verdienste, maar als een verantwoordelijkheid. Dankzij onze positie kunnen we het verschil maken voor onze mensen, het milieu en de maatschappij. En dat blijkt: we zijn een Great Place to Work, hebben de groenste duurzaamheidsplannen in de logistiek en helpen via DHL Cares ontzettend veel mensen die dat hard kunnen gebruiken – daar zijn we trots op!

Do you like to create insights and turn them into action to create lasting impact? We are searching for an experienced Data Scientist for our Data & AI team to support our clients by combining business sense with data modelling. If this description fits your profile, we are looking for you!

The Data & AI team at IG&H is using the latest data and AI technology to help our clients innovate. To do so, our team of 25 data experts works closely together with our Technology and Sector teams. Through smart collaboration, we have delivered over 40 (Gen)AI projects in the last two years for our clients in Retail, Healthcare and Financial Services. As a Data Scientist, you will play a central role in truly understanding our client’s needs, translating this into value, creating solutions, developing Gen(AI) models and turning them into action. We believe it is key to have business sense as well as broad experience with data related topics (analytics, artificial intelligence, etc.) to create real business value. On top of that, you need to be able to communicate clearly and convincingly. Not only for effective project execution, but also to inspire (internal) stakeholders on the latest trends and developments in the field of Data and AI.

You will typically work in multidisciplinary project teams for one project at a time. Although being able to deliver work independently is appreciated, involvement of a project manager and technical experts ensures high-quality delivery and facilitates you to maintain a steep learning curve. We believe in diverse teams and diverse profiles in our Data & AI team. Some of our Data Scientists develop to be great consultants with technical knowledge and execution power, while others focus more on gaining deep technical expertise to deliver value from there. Working on a different range of projects in different sectors, you’ll be able to find your own sweet spot.

In addition, we believe that a caring and fun working environment will help you to dare to step out of your comfort zone and learn. We offer continuous learning through the IG&H Academy, in which you will get trainings to boost your data science, consulting and people skills. Also, you will be assigned a mentor, who will be there for you to provide you with guidance.

Above all, people are at the heart of what we do. This of course comes back in the work we deliver for our clients (why make a data product if the people who need to use it do not understand or want to use it?). At the same time, a fun working culture is key for who we are. With an inspiring office in Utrecht where we can connect, have abundant parties, team activities and sport events (both organized for the entire IG&H organization as well as specifically for the Data & Analytics team), IG&H is truly a Great Place To Work. And yes, we are certified!

Working for the Data & AI Team at IG&H Consulting is incredibly diverse, and fun at the same time. It’s been a great place to develop my technical know-how, management consulting skills and commercial effectivity. The team is young and ambitious, with a strong desire to solve complex puzzles, develop personally & professionally and do fun activities together. All in all, IG&H has been a great place to work for over 6 years already!

Als Data Scientist is dit jouw rol bij DHL.







Dit ga je doen

Als Data Scientist speel je een cruciale rol in het ontwikkelen en implementeren van data gestuurde analyses. Deze analyses, gebaseerd op complexe datasets, bieden waardevolle inzichten voor DHL. Dit omvat het verwerken van grote hoeveelheden ongestructureerde data uit verschillende bronnen om DHL en haar klanten beter te dienen.

Je werkt met de nieuwste technologieën, zoals Azure Databricks, om de meest relevante waarden te presenteren aan afdelingen zoals Operations, Finance en Customer Service. Je werkt volgens de principes van Agile ontwikkeling aan uiteenlopende projecten binnen het gehele bedrijf. Jij bouwt het, jij runt het, jij bent verantwoordelijk! Je besteedt minimaal 32 uur per week aan:




Het analyseren van data, het identificeren van patronen en trends, en het presenteren van bevindingen aan belanghebbenden.
Samenwerken met teams binnen IT/Digital om de beste data gestuurde oplossingen voor te stellen.
Ondersteunen bij het beantwoorden van strategische en operationele vraagstukken door het ontwikkelen van datagestuurde analyses.




Jouw nieuwe werkplek

Je werkt op het hoofdkantoor van DHL eCommerce in Utrecht. Als Data Scientist werk je samen met ingenieurs, producteigenaren en andere wetenschappers in een Scrum-team. Naast je directe collega's heb je ook contact met andere teams en afdelingen. De afdeling Digital en IT, waar je voor werkt, bestaat nu uit 250 collega's.




We luisteren altijd naar wat je te zeggen hebt. Hoe meer perspectieven en meningen we horen, hoe beter we allemaal worden. Dat is waarom onze organisatie het Great Place to Work-certificaat heeft ontvangen, gebaseerd op feedback van medewerkers.




Dit ben jij

Het bouwen aan de toekomst van levering geeft je energie. Elke keer als je een DHL-van voorbij ziet komen, voel je een gevoel van trots - en terecht, want jij draagt bij aan de ontwikkeling ervan. Je bent een vastberaden individu dat goed gedijt in een teamomgeving. Bij DHL werk je met de nieuwste technieken aan grote en schaalbare platformen - een omgeving die je als geen ander aanspreekt.




Verder heb je:

Minimaal een hbo- of universitair werk- en denkniveau.
Minimaal 5 jaar ervaring in een soortgelijke functie.
Sterke programmeervaardigheden, bij voorkeur in Scala.
Ervaring met Spark, CI/CD, Terraform en Kafka.
De wil en nieuwsgierigheid om te werken met event-driven architecture.
Bekendheid met cloud-based oplossingen zoals Azure.




Dit krijg jij

Een baan om trots op te zijn! En niet zomaar een baan, wij gebruiken liever het woord carrière. Als Data Scientist wil jij je namelijk blijven ontwikkelen!




Voor de functie van Data Scientist kan jij rekenen op:

Een salaris tussen € 4.000,- en € 5.500,- bruto op basis van 40 uur, gebaseerd op je kennis en ervaring;
Een bonusregeling van 5%;
Standaard 23 vakantiedagen en 8% vakantiegeld;
Cao a la carte, een budget naar keuze voor extra salaris of vakantiedagen (4,5 dagen per jaar);
Reiskostenvergoeding tot 30 kilometer per enkele reis;
Pensioenregeling;
De mogelijkheid om hybride te werken;
Vanaf dag één uitgebreide opleidings- en trainingsmogelijkheden;
Kansen en mogelijkheden voor ontwikkeling en doorgroei, zowel nationaal- als internationaal!







De toekomst van bezorgen is geel-rood

DHL eCommerce is het meest toonaangevende logistiek bedrijf ter wereld. Dat klinkt misschien opschepperig, maar zo bedoelen we het niet: we zien het namelijk niet als een verdienste, maar als een verantwoordelijkheid. Dankzij onze positie kunnen we het verschil maken voor onze mensen, het milieu en de maatschappij. En dat blijkt: we zijn een Great Place to Work, hebben de groenste duurzaamheidsplannen in de logistiek en helpen via DHL Cares ontzettend veel mensen die dat hard kunnen gebruiken – daar zijn we trots op!
