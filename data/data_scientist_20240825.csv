Our team is diverse, inclusive and focused on individual wellbeing. We are proud to support lots of different working patterns, locations and learning and development activity. We are a multidisciplinary team of analysts, data scientists, scientists, economists, and policy professionals.

The team's purpose is to provide high quality, independent evidence to inform strategic decisions on science and technology. We undertake horizon scanning for new technologies and international comparisons to understand the UK's relative areas of strength and weakness in science and technology. We work with a wide range of data and information sources including academic publication records, patents, financial and national security information.

This Data Scientist role sits within the Science Capability Analysis (SCAN) team within TIFF. The SCAN team seeks to identify the areas of benign neglect in the UK S&T landscape. As an example, a Covid-19 vaccine was created in the UK but there was no manufacturing capability. This issue was likely known to those in industry but not considered as part of a set of risks. Combining analysis of a wide range of data and information, you will work collaboratively to develop a register of issues in S&T capability areas requiring government-led or -initiated intervention, and produce assessments, reports and data on these issues to inform policy decisions. These assessments will help Government understand new and emerging risks and opportunities, and support strategic decision making within the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), the Office for Science and Technology Strategy (OSTS) and other departments across government.

We are fully committed to being an inclusive employer and ensuring equal opportunities. We are keen to make our workforce as diverse as possible and recognise how important inclusivity is to achieve the best outcomes. We hope to attract applications from all underrepresented groups.

You are proficient in coding in Python and have experience with version control
You distil complex problems into simple pieces and have excellent verbal and written communication skills
You thrive in a fast-paced, high-growth, technology-focused organisation
You are comfortable working independently as a Data Scientist and also as part of a multidisciplinary team



Nice to haves:


You have an understanding of industrial and operations processes
You are familiar with optimisation packages (OR-tools, Pulp, CPLEX, Gurobi or similar)
You can run queries and are comfortable studying metrics & KPIs to measure real-world phenomena
You have experience working with the full product life cycle (experimentation, training, testing, monitoring, and deployment)

What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?



The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, and India.


Please only apply to one opening. If you are a better fit for another opening, our team will move your application. Candidates who apply to multiple openings will not be considered.**

          <strong>About Phaidra<br><br></strong>Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.<br><br>The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.<br><br>Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:<br><br><ul><li>We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.</li><li>We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.</li><li>We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.<br><br></li></ul>Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.<br><br>Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, and India.<br><br><ul><li>Please only apply to one opening.

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

At Myant, we are creating the world’s first expressive and continuous digital presence platform, enabled by integrating technology directly into clothing and augmented by other devices, wearables, and IOT. We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.

The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society however, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.

Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.

The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.

We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of fashion, electronics, software, and data science.

The Role:

We are seeking a highly motivated and versatile clinical scientist to join the Clinical Sciences team of the Science and Technology department. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to contribute to ideation, high-level design, and then testing of medical device prototypes based on e-textiles.

To be successful, the candidate must have a strong background in interacting and collecting data with real-world patients of diverse medical conditions, a perfect mastering of the scientific method and knowledge of the clinical trial methodologies (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods), and experience in the redaction of scientific reports and papers.

Experience with bio-signals and/or low-power wearable systems would be an important asset. Applicants should have a keen eye for solving problems that currently do not have well defined solutions and be able to rapidly design/prototype these ideas.

The successful candidate will join a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, textile experts, fashion designers and entrepreneurs to actively participate in the creation and optimization of new products and should be able to effectively work in multi-disciplinary teams.

Responsibilities:


Research, design, and test for the development of the next generation of smart textiles
Rapid ideation, implementation, and validation of biosignal measuring methods and/or devices
Work closely with a variety of people/teams with different disciplines (mechanical, firmware, data science, software, industrial design, textile, quality assurance, regulatory) and mutually educate each other to allow effective teamwork

Conducting research and designing protocols to study the attitude towards Myant product and any resulting behavior change
Integrating the Myant products in the care relationship
Capturing user perspectives from elderly, health care professionals, and other adults with and without health conditions
Write, edit, and amend protocol for internal and external testing, in accordance with company's quality control policy and with Research Ethics Board, respectively
Maintain fluid and productive relationships with partners (universities, start-ups, corporations)
Coordinating clinical studies in partnership with other institutions
Participating in Conferences, Webinars and sharing the experience with other teams
Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures and forms relevant to the Clinical Sciences team, in partnership with the regulatory team


Qualifications:


PhD in a field related to Clinical Sciences
Background in Physiotherapy/physical therapy/kinesiology or related discipline is an asset
2-5 years of clinical experience, particularly in geriatric and/or cardiology care
Strong analytical, problem solving, and leadership capabilities
Ability to contribute and work effectively in a fast-paced, multidisciplinary environment
Understanding of biosignals and signal processing techniques would be an important asset

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


2-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

At Myant, we are creating the world’s first expressive and continuous digital presence platform, enabled by integrating technology directly into clothing and augmented by other devices, wearables, and IOT. We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.

The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society however, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.

Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.

The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.

We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of fashion, electronics, software, and data science.

The Role:

We are seeking a highly motivated and versatile clinical scientist to join the Clinical Sciences team of the Science and Technology department. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to contribute to ideation, high-level design, and then testing of medical device prototypes based on e-textiles.

To be successful, the candidate must have a strong background in interacting and collecting data with real-world patients of diverse medical conditions, a perfect mastering of the scientific method and knowledge of the clinical trial methodologies (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods), and experience in the redaction of scientific reports and papers.

Experience with bio-signals and/or low-power wearable systems would be an important asset. Applicants should have a keen eye for solving problems that currently do not have well defined solutions and be able to rapidly design/prototype these ideas.

The successful candidate will join a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, textile experts, fashion designers and entrepreneurs to actively participate in the creation and optimization of new products and should be able to effectively work in multi-disciplinary teams.

Responsibilities:


Research, design, and test for the development of the next generation of smart textiles
Rapid ideation, implementation, and validation of biosignal measuring methods and/or devices
Work closely with a variety of people/teams with different disciplines (mechanical, firmware, data science, software, industrial design, textile, quality assurance, regulatory) and mutually educate each other to allow effective teamwork
Aid in the testing of prototypes and debug issues on the fly
Conducting research and designing protocols to study the attitude towards Myant product and any resulting behavior change
Integrating the Myant products in the care relationship
Capturing user perspectives from elderly, health care professionals, and other adults with and without health conditions
Write, edit, and amend protocol for internal and external testing, in accordance with company's quality control policy and with Research Ethics Board, respectively
Maintain fluid and productive relationships with partners (universities, start-ups, corporations)
Coordinating clinical studies in partnership with other institutions
Participating in Conferences, Webinars and sharing the experience with other teams
Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures and forms relevant to the Clinical Sciences team, in partnership with the regulatory team


Qualifications:


PhD in a field related to Clinical Sciences
Background in Physiotherapy/physical therapy/kinesiology or related discipline is an asset
2-5 years of clinical experience, particularly in geriatric and/or cardiology care
Strong analytical, problem solving, and leadership capabilities
Ability to contribute and work effectively in a fast-paced, multidisciplinary environment
Understanding of biosignals and signal processing techniques would be an important asset


What we offer at Myant:

The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.<br><br>Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.<br><br>The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.<br><br>We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of fashion, electronics, software, and data science.<br><br>The Role:<br><br>We are seeking a highly motivated and versatile clinical scientist to join the Clinical Sciences team of the Science and Technology department. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to contribute to ideation, high-level design, and then testing of medical device prototypes based on e-textiles.<br><br>To be successful, the candidate must have a strong background in interacting and collecting data with real-world patients of diverse medical conditions, a perfect mastering of the scientific method and knowledge of the clinical trial methodologies (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods), and experience in the redaction of scientific reports and papers.<br><br>Experience with bio-signals and/or low-power wearable systems would be an important asset. Applicants should have a keen eye for solving problems that currently do not have well defined solutions and be able to rapidly design/prototype these ideas.<br><br>The successful candidate will join a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, textile experts, fashion designers and entrepreneurs to actively participate in the creation and optimization of new products and should be able to effectively work in multi-disciplinary teams.<br><br>Responsibilities:<br><br><ul><li>Research, design, and test for the development of the next generation of smart textiles</li><li>Rapid ideation, implementation, and validation of biosignal measuring methods and/or devices</li><li>Work closely with a variety of people/teams with different disciplines (mechanical, firmware, data science, software, industrial design, textile, quality assurance, regulatory) and mutually educate each other to allow effective teamwork</li><li>Aid in the testing of prototypes and debug issues on the fly</li><li>Conducting research and designing protocols to study the attitude towards Myant product and any resulting behavior change</li><li>Integrating the Myant products in the care relationship</li><li>Capturing user perspectives from elderly, health care professionals, and other adults with and without health conditions</li><li>Write, edit, and amend protocol for internal and external testing, in accordance with company's quality control policy and with Research Ethics Board, respectively</li><li>Maintain fluid and productive relationships with partners (universities, start-ups, corporations)</li><li>Coordinating clinical studies in partnership with other institutions</li><li>Participating in Conferences, Webinars and sharing the experience with other teams</li><li>Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures and forms relevant to the Clinical Sciences team, in partnership with the regulatory team<br><br></li></ul>Qualifications:<br><br><ul><li>PhD in a field related to Clinical Sciences</li><li>Background in Physiotherapy/physical therapy/kinesiology or related discipline is an asset</li><li>2-5 years of clinical experience, particularly in geriatric and/or cardiology care</li><li>Strong analytical, problem solving, and leadership capabilities</li><li>Ability to contribute and work effectively in a fast-paced, multidisciplinary environment</li><li>Understanding of biosignals and signal processing techniques would be an important asset<br><br></li></ul>What we offer at Myant:<br><br><ul><li>Free SKIIN Employee Kit</li><li>Employee stock options</li><li>Paid Sick Days and Personal Days</li><li>Group Health Insurance Plan</li><li>Employee Referral Program</li><li>Corporate Events</li><li>Exposure working in one of the most innovative and forward-thinking start-ups that is passionate and dedicated towards the healthcare industry<br><br></li></ul>Powered by JazzHR<br><br>wnKHEe5mFt
