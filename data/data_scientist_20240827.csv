Our team is diverse, inclusive and focused on individual wellbeing. We are proud to support lots of different working patterns, locations and learning and development activity. We are a multidisciplinary team of analysts, data scientists, scientists, economists, and policy professionals.

The team's purpose is to provide high quality, independent evidence to inform strategic decisions on science and technology. We undertake horizon scanning for new technologies and international comparisons to understand the UK's relative areas of strength and weakness in science and technology. We work with a wide range of data and information sources including academic publication records, patents, financial and national security information.

This Data Scientist role sits within the Science Capability Analysis (SCAN) team within TIFF. The SCAN team seeks to identify the areas of benign neglect in the UK S&T landscape. As an example, a Covid-19 vaccine was created in the UK but there was no manufacturing capability. This issue was likely known to those in industry but not considered as part of a set of risks. Combining analysis of a wide range of data and information, you will work collaboratively to develop a register of issues in S&T capability areas requiring government-led or -initiated intervention, and produce assessments, reports and data on these issues to inform policy decisions. These assessments will help Government understand new and emerging risks and opportunities, and support strategic decision making within the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), the Office for Science and Technology Strategy (OSTS) and other departments across government.

We are fully committed to being an inclusive employer and ensuring equal opportunities. We are keen to make our workforce as diverse as possible and recognise how important inclusivity is to achieve the best outcomes. We hope to attract applications from all underrepresented groups.

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, and India.


Please only apply to one opening. If you are a better fit for another opening, our team will move your application. Candidates who apply to multiple openings will not be considered.**

Who are we and why do we do what we do?

We are a data and payments company on a mission! We’re a group of developers, financial experts, and optimists who share a vision for improving the financial wellness of people, their businesses, and their communities.

We started this company with the aim of changing how the industry used and viewed data. As architects of Open Banking, Open Finance, and Open Data, we strive to be a force for good — changing the status quo of how businesses interact with people. We strive to serve the whole population through every change in their finances.

We do this by powering businesses through our APIs and Personal Finance Tech solutions as well as our own personal financial management app for consumers.

We can only do that by being an inclusive and diverse organisation. We invest in our people, and enjoy an environment focused on innovation, collaboration and openness.

What do we offer?

We champion flexibility, and we trust and respect our employees to deliver results in a way that best suits them, working around their own lives and commitments.

We live and breathe a fantastic culture of remote working and you may perform your duties predominantly from your home. However, the heart of Moneyhub is in Bristol and from time to time you will be required to attend company meet ups. Your role may require you to attend client meetings, networking events or group training sessions. You may also be required to work at such other place or places as we may reasonably require from time to time. As a minimum, you will be required to attend a quarterly All Team Away Day at a location of our choice (including overseas).

As well as a truly flexible approach, we also offer a fantastic range of benefits, including:

Remote working - with quarterly away days, regular team meeting and face to face client meetings as required.

10% contribution towards your Pension from your very first day with us;

25 days of holiday (plus bank hols), rising to 30 days after two years;

Choose to take your entitlement to UK bank holidays at other times based on your own days of significance;

Private medical insurance, including cover for pre-existing conditions, plus dental and optical benefit;

Six week Moneyhubber Family Pay when you become a new parent;

Permanent health insurance and life cover - much greater than the industry standard (death in service);

Employee assistance programme;

Professional development support, with dedicated allowance of time and money;

Life event leave;

Cycle to work scheme;

EV Salary sacrifice scheme;

£750 towards professional memberships

Remote working benefits, including work from almost anywhere, access to co-working spaces and support for your home office set-up

High spec laptop

Requirements

Sounds great right? What will you be doing?

The Data Science capability at Moneyhub generates value from a rich repository of data sources. Its function is critical to the day-to-day running of the business, and it also spearheads the development of novel ideas to exploit new commercial opportunities.

You Can Expect To Work On


The Machine Learning based transaction categorisation engine that underpins the budgeting capabilities of the app and affordability checking, e.g. for mortgages.
Data Science oriented product development: identifying improvements to existing algorithms, or the creation of new products using a quantitative approach. Examples: identifying regular payments from raw transaction data, geotagging banking transactions from their descriptions, reverse engineering credit card APRs.
Analysis of the characteristics of the user base, i.e. user segmentation, to support business decisions. For instance, what’s the current financial situation of the users of the app, what are their goals and how should the product be developed to aid the user in their journey?

The carbon credit industry is estimated to be worth $500B in 2024 with exponential growth forecast. We expect to be a major enabler in the move towards a carbon free world.




About the Role: The company is on a mission to revolutionize contracts and risk management in carbon markets with our cutting-edge platform. We are seeking an entrepreneurial ML engineer to join us as a founding team member. You will work closely with the founder, an experienced entrepreneur. This role offers the potential for co-founder status for the right candidate.




As a key member of our team, you will be responsible for building and fine-tuning LLMs (Large Language Models) while actively contributing to the development process. Your focus will be on building and scaling our innovative platform which will leverage a carbon semantic layer and advanced AI/ML technologies to automate contract drafting and lifecycle management, document handling, integrate diverse data sources, streamline workflows, and provide robust risk management tools. Ultimately, the platform will leverage this data moat to build a much-needed global custodian for carbon.




Who You Are:




Builder at Heart: You have a proven track record of shipping products in fast-paced environments.

First Principles Thinker: You break down complex problems to their core components and build scalable solutions from scratch. What did you do with your Legos? Build what was on the box or make an entirely new creation?

Expertise in Agentic Systems and Graph RAG: You have experience with LLMs, RL techniques, recommendation systems, Q&A “chatbot” systems using RAG techniques or similar, and a strong understanding of graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Knowledge Graphs Proficiency: You have experience with knowledge graphs and graph databases like Nebula, ArangoDB, or similar.

Production-Oriented: You are keen to push your research results to customers, solving real-world problems.

Startup Enthusiast: You thrive in a dynamic environment, enjoy interacting with customers, and quickly pivot to address changing priorities.

Team Player: You value working with low ego, ambitious, and pragmatic colleagues.

Innovative Thinker: You are comfortable building new solutions and figuring out complex problems.

Effective Communicator: You excel in both written and verbal communication.

Technical Proficiency: You have experience with most of the following: Python, AWS, Docker, Pytorch, Langchain, DSPy, Relevant datastores (MySQL, Postgres), Flask, FastAPI, Huggingface Transformers, multiple foundation models and API’s (i.e not just ChatGPT wrappers)

London-Based: You are excited to work in-person from our London office (70% of the time).

Key Responsibilities:




Design LLM-Powered Agents: Create agents that analyse and manage carbon market data, financing and purchase contracts pushing the boundaries of what agentic systems can achieve.

Develop Data Pipelines: Build real-time data transformation pipelines to convert diverse, unstructured data into actionable insights for our customers.

Graph RAG and Knowledge Graphs: Implement and leverage graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques and knowledge graph databases like Nebula, ArangoDB, or similar.

Define Market Standards: Lead the development of data products that set new standards in carbon market intelligence.

At Bazaarvoice, we create smart shopping experiences. Through our expansive global network, product-passionate community & enterprise technology, we connect thousands of brands and retailers with billions of consumers. Our solutions enable brands to connect with consumers and collect valuable user-generated content, at an unprecedented scale. This content achieves global reach by leveraging our extensive and ever-expanding retail, social & search syndication network. And we make it easy for brands & retailers to gain valuable business insights from real-time consumer feedback with intuitive tools and dashboards. The result is smarter shopping: loyal customers, increased sales, and improved products.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.

What you’ll do

As a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.

Responsibilities


Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


A Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2025, or equivalent work experience
Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts



Preferred Qualifications


One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$104,000 - C$156,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.## What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

At Myant, we are creating the world’s first expressive and continuous digital presence platform, enabled by integrating technology directly into clothing and augmented by other devices, wearables, and IOT. We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.

The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society however, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.

Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.

The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.

We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of fashion, electronics, software, and data science.

The Role:

We are seeking a highly motivated and versatile clinical scientist to join the Clinical Sciences team of the Science and Technology department. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to contribute to ideation, high-level design, and then testing of medical device prototypes based on e-textiles.

To be successful, the candidate must have a strong background in interacting and collecting data with real-world patients of diverse medical conditions, a perfect mastering of the scientific method and knowledge of the clinical trial methodologies (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods), and experience in the redaction of scientific reports and papers.

Experience with bio-signals and/or low-power wearable systems would be an important asset. Applicants should have a keen eye for solving problems that currently do not have well defined solutions and be able to rapidly design/prototype these ideas.

The successful candidate will join a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, textile experts, fashion designers and entrepreneurs to actively participate in the creation and optimization of new products and should be able to effectively work in multi-disciplinary teams.

Responsibilities:


Research, design, and test for the development of the next generation of smart textiles
Rapid ideation, implementation, and validation of biosignal measuring methods and/or devices
Work closely with a variety of people/teams with different disciplines (mechanical, firmware, data science, software, industrial design, textile, quality assurance, regulatory) and mutually educate each other to allow effective teamwork
Aid in the testing of prototypes and debug issues on the fly
Conducting research and designing protocols to study the attitude towards Myant product and any resulting behavior change
Integrating the Myant products in the care relationship
Capturing user perspectives from elderly, health care professionals, and other adults with and without health conditions
Write, edit, and amend protocol for internal and external testing, in accordance with company's quality control policy and with Research Ethics Board, respectively
Maintain fluid and productive relationships with partners (universities, start-ups, corporations)
Coordinating clinical studies in partnership with other institutions
Participating in Conferences, Webinars and sharing the experience with other teams
Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures and forms relevant to the Clinical Sciences team, in partnership with the regulatory team


Qualifications:


PhD in a field related to Clinical Sciences
Background in Physiotherapy/physical therapy/kinesiology or related discipline is an asset
2-5 years of clinical experience, particularly in geriatric and/or cardiology care
Strong analytical, problem solving, and leadership capabilities
Ability to contribute and work effectively in a fast-paced, multidisciplinary environment
Understanding of biosignals and signal processing techniques would be an important asset


What we offer at Myant:


Free SKIIN Employee Kit
Employee stock options
Paid Sick Days and Personal Days
Group Health Insurance Plan
Employee Referral Program
Corporate Events
Exposure working in one of the most innovative and forward-thinking start-ups that is passionate and dedicated towards the healthcare industry

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team.

You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

DarkVision, part of Koch Engineered Solutions, is looking for an intermediate to senior level Machine Learning Scientist. DarkVision’s ultrasound imaging asset inspection system collects huge datasets in the order of hundreds of gigabytes that are several kilometers long where a defect may be on the order of a few millimetres.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Come take off with us!

The yearly total compensation for this senior position ranges from $150,000 to $350,000 CAD.

Layer 2 features such as 802.1d bridging, the 802.1d Spanning Tree Protocol, the 802.1ax Link Aggregation Control Protocol, the 802.1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol, or RFC 1812 IP routing.
Ability to utilize, test, and debug packet forwarding engine and a hardware component’s vendor provided software libraries in your solutions.
Infrastructure functions related to distributed systems such as messaging, signalling, databases, and command line interface techniques.
Hands on experience in the design and development of ethernet bridging or routing related software or distributed systems software is desirable.
Hands on experience with enterprise or service provider class Ethernet switch/router system software development, or significant PhD level research in the area of network routing and packet forwarding.
Applied understanding of software engineering principles.
Strong problem solving and software troubleshooting skills.
Ability to design a solution to a small-sized problem, and implement that solution without outside help. Able to work on a small team solving a medium-sized problem with limited oversight.

Layer 2 features such as 802.1d bridging, the 802.1d Spanning Tree Protocol, the 802.1ax Link Aggregation Control Protocol, the 802.1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol, or RFC 1812 IP routing.
Ability to utilize, test, and debug packet forwarding engine and a hardware component’s vendor provided software libraries in your solutions.
Infrastructure functions related to distributed systems such as messaging, signalling, databases, and command line interface techniques.
Hands on experience in the design and development of ethernet bridging or routing related software or distributed systems software is desirable.
Hands on experience with enterprise or service provider class Ethernet switch/router system software development, or significant PhD level research in the area of network routing and packet forwarding.
Applied understanding of software engineering principles.
Strong problem solving and software troubleshooting skills.
Ability to design a solution to a small-sized problem, and implement that solution without outside help. Able to work on a small team solving a medium-sized problem with limited oversight.

Why Narvar?

We're on a mission to simplify the everyday lives of consumers. Post-purchase is a critical phase of the customer journey. That's why we created Narvar - a platform focused on driving customer loyalty through seamless post-purchase experiences that allow retailers to retain, engage, and delight customers. If you've ever bought something online, there's a good chance you've used our platform!

And ever since, the happiness, development, and contribution of every Workmate is central to who we are. Our Workmates believe a healthy employee-centric, collaborative culture is the essential mix of ingredients for success in business. That’s why we look after our people, communities and the planet while still being profitable. Feel encouraged to shine, however that manifests: you don’t need to hide who you are. You can feel the energy and the passion, it's what makes us unique. Inspired to make a brighter work day for all and transform with us to the next stage of our growth journey? Bring your brightest version of you and have a brighter work day here.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.
