About Phaidra

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, and India.

DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

A generative AI portfolio company is looking to hire a number of machine learning engineers of varied experience levels as their sales increase and they confirm product-market fit.

While being good at what you do are table stakes, we believe the following will make you successful in a startup:


Optimistic individuals are persistent, determined, and unwilling to give up in the face of adversity. They keep working towards a goal or objective despite setbacks or failures. Optimism often involves a combination of perseverance, resilience, and determination.
Growth-oriented individuals embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a key to success. They are willing to take risks and push themselves outside of their comfort zones. Growth-oriented individuals are curious, see learning as a lifelong process, and embrace feedback. They are willing to try new things, and are not afraid to change direction if something isn’t working.
Effective individuals collaborate well, work consistently and purposefully towards achieving their goals, efficiently manage their time, and are self-motivated. They are able to identify problems, analyze them critically, and develop effective solutions.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe’s mission is to build the economic infrastructure for the internet. Risk Engineering brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s financial and regulatory risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. We build ML and backend systems to catch fraudsters, understand users’ cash flow and financial health, and ensure Stripe’s users are compliant with regulatory and financial partner requirements. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from financial losses that can put Stripe’s business at risk.

The Risk group consists of machine learning, backend, and full stack engineers who tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We are undertaking several new efforts, where you can have an outsized impact on the architecture, implementation, and design choices behind these systems.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching models
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly reduce Stripe’s financial losses
Building systems that evaluate businesses for risk and take appropriate actions
Working with our partner teams to launch new policies that directly impact Stripe’s bottom line
Helping engineers across the company to develop technologies for scaling our infrastructure
Debugging production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 2 years of industry experience in training ML models
Enjoy and have experience shipping ML models in a large-scale production environment
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


Have experience in Python, Scala (Spark), or Ruby



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our salary ranges are based on paying competitively for our size and industry, and are one part of many compensation, benefits and other reward opportunities we provide (e.g. bonus, stock options, 401(k) match, etc.)

Individual pay rate decisions are based on a number of factors, including qualifications for the role, experience level, skillset, and balancing internal equity relative to peers at the company. We expect the majority of the candidates who are offered roles at our company to fall healthily throughout the range based on these factors.

The range above is for the expectations as laid out in the job description, however we are often open to a wide variety of profiles, and recognize that the person we hire may be less experienced (or more senior) than this job description as posted. If that ends up being the case, the updated salary range will be communicated with you as a candidate.

The salary range above is for the NY/CA. As a company, we have a location based strategy, which means the salary range could be lower or higher than this if the role is hired in another location.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Most importantly, we seek people who are excited about crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

The Roku Culture

Come join us on our mission to flip the 95% drug failure rate to a 95% success rate.

What we do:

Our immune systems are master regulators of health and disease. Current tools used to discover drugs that target the immune system are wildly inadequate. To fix this critical gap, Parallel Bio created a human 'immune system in a dish' to rapidly accelerate the development of new drugs and immunotherapies more likely to work in patients. This is the first step on our journey to build a new type of biopharma by reimagining the way we cure disease. Our mission is to design and engineer breakthrough tools inspired by human biology, starting with replacing ineffectual mouse and synthetic platforms.

Who you are:

You are someone excited about what we are doing at Parallel Bio and have a scientific background. Please submit your information here if you have a background in the following:


Have held a position like junior scientist, principal scientist, data scientist, Head of R&D, Head of Biology
A concentration or background in Immunology, Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Data Science and more


Why work with us:

As experts in human drug discovery, we have worked hard to position the company for success and to expand our team. We are funded by some of the world's best investors: Y Combinator, Refactor Capital, Breakout Ventures, leaders from pharma, tech, government, and more. You're joining an incredibly ambitious team at an early enough time to help us define our culture, choices, and impact success. We will have the highest expectations of you, just as we do of ourselves. Join us in re-imagining what's possible with immunotherapy!

We are building a diverse, interdisciplinary team of dreamers and doers. Forget incrementalism and leave low-risk ideas at the door. We're looking for fellow visionaries hungry for real impact in reimagining every facet of how we cure disease. Some of our values: first principles thinking, burning passion, and a drive to work with people with like-minded values; thinking outside the box and the ability to envision that which has not yet been built; listen, then talk; don't forget to have fun; cooperation, trust, ethics, and transparency.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Most importantly, we seek people who are excited about crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

Verily is a subsidiary of Alphabet that is using a data-driven approach to change the way people manage their health and the way healthcare is delivered. Launched from Google X in 2015, our purpose is to bring the promise of precision health to everyone, every day. We are focused on generating and activating data from a variety of sources, including clinical, social, behavioral and the real world, to arrive at the best solutions for a person based on a comprehensive view of the evidence.

Description

As a Data Scientist on our Registries and RWD (real-world data) team, you will be supporting our core mission to drive innovation in evidence generation for research and care decisions. We are building new types of longitudinal datasets that have foundations of RWD sources, such as EHRs (electronic health records) and claims data, and are augmented with prospective data collection. You will develop and deploy models that enable scalable curation of RWD. This will include multi-source integrations and reconciliations, creating derived features from the source data (e.g., abstraction of clinical concepts from unstructured data), and facilitating data quality assessments. You will work with a diverse cross-functional team to build reusable and scalable tools and to deliver products that unlock information from structured and unstructured clinical data.

Responsibilities


Work closely with cross-functional partners to design and create longitudinal datasets integrating multiple data sources.
Build and implement highly accurate machine learning models / AI tools using sparsely labeled healthcare datasets.
Implement, build on and augment existing LLM/NLP tools to maximize the value of using unstructured medical data across a range of research and care applications.
Become an expert in our data’s capabilities and limitations. Solve difficult, non-routine analysis problems, handling data challenges from a real-world setting.
Communicate technical methods and results clearly in well structured reports and presentations to a range of technical and non-technical audiences.


Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications


Advanced degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., data sciences, statistics, biomedical informatics, computer science, applied mathematics, or similar), or equivalent practical experience.
2+ years experience applying advanced machine learning and AI techniques (supervised and unsupervised methods, LLMs, NLP) to clinical data.
Direct experience working with and curating real-world data, such as EHR, including a deep understanding of the complexities of this structured and unstructured clinical data.
Strong proficiency in Python.


Preferred Qualifications


Familiarity with medical terminologies and ontologies.
Familiarity with software engineering practices and experience developing production software.
Experience working with clinical subject matter experts.
Ability to work cross-functionally on teams, with a tolerance for ambiguity.
Creative and methodical problem solving: understand needs, identify options, form hypotheses, generate robust results, make informed decisions, and learn faster through feedback.

Who You Are

&#55357;&#56988; You love crypto and DeFi, know the difference between hodling, staking, and yield farming, and you have used both Ethereum and other chains.

&#55357;&#56425;‍&#55357;&#56507; You are self-directed. You are insatiably curious. You can be counted on to work through a project, commit and go deep while seeking help when you need it, and propel it forward without hand-holding.

&#55357;&#56528; You are fastidious and meticulous in your work. You will put in the time to make an order from chaos. You’ve looked into the eye of Sauron and lived to make a graph. You don’t mind doing the “grunt work” to build up to the full picture, or go as low as it takes? Muckraking? More like fun-making.

&#55356;&#57256; You're creative and you aren't afraid to be wrong.

&#10052;&#65039; You are super comfortable in SQL-like databases (we use Snowflake)

®&#65039; You are intimately familiar with R for analysis, exploration, and model-building. And you have an opinion about data. table vs dplyr. Python is OK too, but we have a lot of R code, so you need to be comfortable there.

&#55356;&#57331;&#65039;‍&#55356;&#57096; You take pride in your code. It's readable, functional, and reproducible. You commit regularly for all the right reasons.

&#55358;&#56785;‍&#55356;&#57323; You can describe a complex problem (or solution) in a way that doesn't put people to sleep and doesn't leave them scratching their heads.

What You'll Work On

Work directly with the company's community, our internal analytics & data platform teams.

Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to explore, visualize, and validate our data.

Work closely with our marketing team to share what we learn with the world, and educate anyone who wants to learn more.

Support the efforts of our product teams to help transform our apps into more data-driven, web3-connected, powerful experiences for our growing base of thousands of users.

Desired Experience

Experience with Crypto/Blockchain is a requirement.

Prior experience as an analyst or data scientist, working directly with database-level data, whether formally or self-taught.

At least 2 years in a formal data science role, ideally working primarily in R

Experience working with product & marketing teams, developers, and data engineers

Come contribute to our growing body of tools, research, and IP that make blockchain and crypto data more accessible.

Who You Are

&#55358;&#56814; You love data and stats. You know some formal statistics, ML, and data exploration techniques, even better if you’ve done network analysis.

&#55357;&#56988; You love crypto and DeFi, know the difference between hodling, staking, and yield farming, and you have used both Ethereum and other chains.

&#55357;&#56425;‍&#55357;&#56507; You are self-directed. You are insatiably curious. You can be counted on to work through a project, commit and go deep while seeking help when you need it, and propel it forward without hand-holding.

&#55357;&#56528; You are fastidious and meticulous in your work. You will put in the time to make an order from chaos. You’ve looked into the eye of Sauron and lived to make a graph. You don’t mind doing the “grunt work” to build up to the full picture, or go as low as it takes? Muckraking? More like fun-making.

&#55356;&#57256; You're creative and you aren't afraid to be wrong.

&#10052;&#65039; You are super comfortable in SQL-like databases (we use Snowflake)

®&#65039; You are intimately familiar with R for analysis, exploration, and model-building. And you have an opinion about data. table vs dplyr. Python is OK too, but we have a lot of R code, so you need to be comfortable there.

&#55356;&#57331;&#65039;‍&#55356;&#57096; You take pride in your code. It's readable, functional, and reproducible. You commit regularly for all the right reasons.

&#55358;&#56785;‍&#55356;&#57323; You can describe a complex problem (or solution) in a way that doesn't put people to sleep and doesn't leave them scratching their heads.

What You'll Work On

Work directly with the company's community, our internal analytics & data platform teams.

Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to explore, visualize, and validate our data.

Work closely with our marketing team to share what we learn with the world, and educate anyone who wants to learn more.

Support the efforts of our product teams to help transform our apps into more data-driven, web3-connected, powerful experiences for our growing base of thousands of users.

Desired Experience

Experience with Crypto/Blockchain is a requirement.

Prior experience as an analyst or data scientist, working directly with database-level data, whether formally or self-taught.

At least 2 years in a formal data science role, ideally working primarily in R

Experience working with product & marketing teams, developers, and data engineers

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.
