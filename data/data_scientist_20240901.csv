About the Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has got Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Develop and automate forecasting models to plan the capacity of the support centers across different locations.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track scheduling efficiency, occupancy rates, and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building forecasting models & time series analysis (Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters or similar).
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in Cost Analysis, What-if Scenario Analysis, Capacity planning, and Workforce Management is nice to have but not mandatory.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

At Trade Republic, we are on a mission to empower everyone to create wealth with easy, safe and free access to the financial system. With over four million customers we are the largest savings platforms in Europe, with users holding over €35 billion on our platform.

We are seen as the go-to-destination for top talent from across the globe. Everyday we strive to make Trade Republic a great environment to do the best work of your life, surrounded by exceptional, caring and passionate colleagues. In addition to learning and growing with a world-class team, you will build a destination for millions of people across Europe to create wealth.




ABOUT THE TEAM




At Trade Republic, safeguarding our customers and fortifying our company against malicious actors isn't just a goal - it's an imperative.




Our Fincrime team leads the charge in proactively preventing, detecting, and halting any form of exploitation aimed at our products or our valued clientele. To achieve this, we recognize that data isn't just a resource - it's a cornerstone.




As a Senior Data Scientist on our Fincrime team, you're not just another cog in the machine. You are an integral part of a tight-knit team that truly owns the services and technical products it develops. You won't just build and maintain data products; you will have end-to-end ownership of them. This goes beyond mere maintenance or feature updates; it's about being fully accountable for your products' lifecycle - from ideation and scoping with product managers to final integration and ongoing evaluation with our engineering teams.




Please note that the position will either be based in London or Berlin, depending on your availability.




WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING




Own the Roadmap: Plan and execute the roadmap for your services together with the team
Architectural Influence: Play a pivotal role in designing the architecture of your data products, ensuring they are scalable, robust, and synergistic with our existing platforms.
Technical Excellence: Research, build, test and deploy models - this is where you will spend most of your time. With a focus on team ownership, this gives a lot of time for our developers and data scientists to actually work technically instead of with process.
Technical Leadership: Serve as a mentor to other engineers and establish yourself as a subject-matter expert within the team, lending your expertise to solve deeply complex issues in the fintech security landscape.
Accountability and Monitoring : Once deployed, you will continue to oversee your products, monitoring their performance metrics and making data-driven adjustments as needed to optimise results.




WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR




We are aware that everyone has their individual strengths and weaknesses. The one thing where we don’t compromise is joy for our work and dedication to our shared mission. If you feel you are not ticking all the boxes below, but have a good general feeling about most of them, we would be very happy to talk!




We recommend you have at least 5 years of end-to-end data science and software engineering experience, preferably in a dynamic environment with a modern tech stack
Experience working in the Financial domain, specifically significant experience in Anti Financial Crime is a must
Strong business acumen in the areas of finance and product
Exceptional interpersonal and communication skills, both with engineers and business stakeholders
Experience with applying a wide variety of machine learning techniques to business problems, particularly with tabular and natural language data
Strong command of SQL, Python together with its scientific stack (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
Good understanding of Software Engineering practices (e.g. test-driven development, OOP, CI/CD, etc.) and experience with productionizing ML products




WHY YOU SHOULD APPLY NOW




At Trade Republic you will get to do the best work of your career. We are a destination for people who are exceptional at what they do. Every day, we strive to build a world-class team and provide the space for people to do their best. We have a relentless ambition of raising the bar and expect the best from ourselves. Through our dedicated people-first management approach and transparent career paths, you will have the opportunity to develop and grow your career like never before. And because you are surrounded by a diverse team of high performers, you will be learning every day.




You will play an important role in fixing one of the largest challenges we face - closing the pension gap and democratizing wealth. Trade Republic is a place where your job, your career and your passions intersect. If this gets you fired up, just like it does for all of us at Trade Republic, then reach out!




Trade Republic embraces diversity and strives for equal opportunity for everyone. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, characteristics, perspectives and skills. We encourage applicants of diverse gender, age, sexuality, religion, ethnicity, disability status and parental status to apply to our roles, or those from other intersecting minority groups not listed. The more diverse and inclusive we are as a team, the greater our work will be. If we can support you on DEI related questions during the interview process, please reach out to talentacquisition@traderepublic.com.

For the remaining 60% you can work remotely within Germany and for 20 days per year outside of Germany. Because of this 40/60 share, you should be able to come to our office regularly. We support your commute with a “Bahncard 50” which gives you a 50% discount on train tickets within Germany. Note that we cannot provide you with relocation & visa assistance.

We build the perfect shopping companions

The role includes the following:


Analyze and organize raw data
Build data systems and pipelines
Evaluate business needs and objectives
Interpret trends and patterns
Conduct complex data analysis and report on results



Requirements

We have high ambitions and the vision to change the way users and customers plan and organize shopping. For this position we are looking for someone with substantial experience in Data Science or Engineering.

You are the right fit if you have:


Experience in data engineering or a degree in Computer Science, IT, or similar field
Strong Software Engineering skills and technical expertise with machine learning, data mining, and data analytics
Knowledge of programming languages (e.g. Java, Scala, Python)
Knowledge of business intelligence tools (e.g. Adverity, Looker) is of advantage
Hands-on experience with SQL database design
Great numerical, analytical and statistical skills
Experience with Apache Spark and Hadoop is highly desirable
Experience with cloud platforms (e.g. AWS) is a plus
Business fluent in English, preferably German as well

Freedom and flexibility in your work schedule, allowing you to work when you're most productive
The latest MacBooks/HPs, including a mouse, keyboard, and high-quality headphones for your work
An extra day off on your birthday because we think it's important to celebrate
A modern and attractive working environment in the heart of Berlin (and additional offices in Zurich and Basel) with free barista-grade coffee
A commitment to sustainability, including mostly traveling by public transport and providing a Bahncard 50
Social events that bring the team together, including twice-yearly company-wide get-togethers and regular team events, all covered by us!

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

Job Description

We have recently established a Data Science team at the centre of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT). The team's mission is to engage with every corner of the department to uncover opportunities where innovative and experimental data science techniques can enhance existing products, processes, and analysis or generate entirely novel insights. This spans across sectors from telecoms to quantum to AI, all while embracing the possibility of failure as a path to discovery. Through this, we will help set the strategic direction for a department that prioritises data, evidence, and real-time monitoring, and ensure that DSIT becomes data-confident. 

This role offers an unparalleled opportunity to shape and define your position within an established team, pitching project ideas and exploring novel collaborations. Your contribution will help further a team culture that fosters creativity and innovation in leveraging the latest developments in data science, such as generative AI and LLMs, to deliver transformative insights. You will be joining at a critical time, with the chance to influence how data science shapes the department's impact in a still-evolving landscape.  

We are looking for highly motivated individuals to join us as we refine our operating model to enhance DSIT's data science capability. Technical skills are necessary for the role, but we are equally interested in your ability to be a proactive, independent thinker, eager to contribute to a team culture of innovation and collaboration. Our work will touch on exciting policy areas and involve collaboration with analytical teams across the department (such as the Government Office for Science), arms-length bodies (e.g. UK Research and Innovation and the UK Space Agency), and executive agencies (e.g., Building Digital UK). This means we will have the opportunity to explore many fascinating projects, either independently as a team or in collaboration with the analytical teams embedded across the department. Innovation is enshrined in the name, delivery plan, and ethos of the department, so we will have every opportunity to explore new ideas, trial novel approaches, and have the freedom to carve our own path. 

We have a vision for the team to be highly collaborative and proactively inclusive, with the flexibility to respond quickly to urgent asks while building out longer-term data science projects and products. We have access to multiple data science platforms and sandbox areas, meaning you can access truly novel tools and be working on cutting-edge data science techniques. Additionally, learning and development is a core focus of the team, with an afternoon a week reserved as protected time specifically for self-directed learning and development. We celebrate and value this L&D, and actively cascade outputs between members of the team.

The team's mission is to engage with every corner of the department to uncover opportunities where innovative and experimental data science techniques can enhance existing products, processes, and analysis or generate entirely novel insights. This spans across sectors from telecoms to quantum to AI, all while embracing the possibility of failure as a path to discovery. Through this, we will help set the strategic direction for a department that prioritises data, evidence, and real-time monitoring, and ensure that DSIT becomes data-confident. <br><br>This role offers an unparalleled opportunity to shape and define your position within an established team, pitching project ideas and exploring novel collaborations. Your contribution will help further a team culture that fosters creativity and innovation in leveraging the latest developments in data science, such as generative AI and LLMs, to deliver transformative insights. You will be joining at a critical time, with the chance to influence how data science shapes the department's impact in a still-evolving landscape.  <br><br>We are looking for highly motivated individuals to join us as we refine our operating model to enhance DSIT's data science capability. Technical skills are necessary for the role, but we are equally interested in your ability to be a proactive, independent thinker, eager to contribute to a team culture of innovation and collaboration. Our work will touch on exciting policy areas and involve collaboration with analytical teams across the department (such as the Government Office for Science), arms-length bodies (e.g. UK Research and Innovation and the UK Space Agency), and executive agencies (e.g., Building Digital UK). This means we will have the opportunity to explore many fascinating projects, either independently as a team or in collaboration with the analytical teams embedded across the department. Innovation is enshrined in the name, delivery plan, and ethos of the department, so we will have every opportunity to explore new ideas, trial novel approaches, and have the freedom to carve our own path. <br><br>We have a vision for the team to be highly collaborative and proactively inclusive, with the flexibility to respond quickly to urgent asks while building out longer-term data science projects and products. We have access to multiple data science platforms and sandbox areas, meaning you can access truly novel tools and be working on cutting-edge data science techniques. Additionally, learning and development is a core focus of the team, with an afternoon a week reserved as protected time specifically for self-directed learning and development. We celebrate and value this L&amp;D, and actively cascade outputs between members of the team.<br><br><strong>Person specification<br><br></strong><strong>Key Responsibilities<br><br></strong>The work within the team is intended to be experimental and innovative.

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

Ki is the biggest global insurance tech company you’ve never heard of, unless you’ve been looking to insure a satellite, wind farm or music festival recently.




We launched in 2021 on the back of a fund raise that delivered $500m of investment, making us one the largest fintech start-ups that year. Our investors were excited about the fact we were revolutionising the way a 333 year-old industry was working. We have written over $400m worth of premium in 2021. Together with partners at Google and UCL we developed Ki and created a platform that helps insurance brokers cover risks in a fast and frictionless way. We’re continuing to lead the charge on the digitisation of this market and that’s where you come in - we need more excellent minds to work with us to realise this goal and create more opportunities. If helping us transform a multi-billion global industry sounds exciting to you, read on.




What you will be working on




You’ll work on Ki’s suite of risk assessment machine learning models by building models, carrying out analysis of machine learning model quality to identify potential improvements in our models and you’ll own the delivery of individual machine learning models to help Ki better assess and manage risk.




Fully utilizing your experience with common machine learning frameworks (e.g. scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.) as well as any experience you have working in cloud environments, you’ll work closely with the Ki Portfolio Underwriting team to appropriately formulate commercial challenges as machine learning problems. Joining our Data Science community within Ki you’ll further develop your skills and guide junior members helping them improve their engineering skill level and understanding of the insurance market.




You’ll join a team on an exciting journey –we’re solving industry problems that have never been solved before.




Our culture




Inclusion & Diversity is at the heart of our business at Ki. We recognise that diversity in age, race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical ability, thought and social background bring richness to our working environment. No matter who you are, where you’re from, how you think, or who you love, we believe you should be you.




You’ll get a highly competitive remuneration and benefits package. This is kept under constant review to make sure it stays relevant. We understand the power of saying thank you and take time to acknowledge and reward extraordinary effort by teams or individuals.

Our Values

Replicant has three core values. It is critical that everyone who joins the team feels excited and moved by these values as every new team member makes an impact on our culture.

Blade Runners: We take ownership and pride to influence the outcomes of our goals. We are successful, and like a Blade Runner, use the tools at our disposal to reach our objectives. We value open and honest communication and proactively seek feedback along the way. We are a company driven to grow and achieve both individually and as a team.

Bread Makers: We are humble and strive toward an egalitarian culture. No task is too big or too small. We work together to achieve our goals and develop our company mission. We believe that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts in everything that we do.

Självdistans (Self-Distance): Självdistans is Swedish for self-distance. It's the ability to critically reflect on oneself and one's relations from an external perspective. With this in mind, we act with objectivity and always remember that we are not our work. There's no perfect science to growing a team or business, but we trust everyone at Replicant to point out our blind spots and humbly admit their own.

Replicant is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to fostering an inclusive, diverse and equitable workplace that is built on trust, support and respect. We welcome all individuals and do not discriminate on the basis of gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, colour, religion, creed, gender, national origin, age, marital status, pregnancy, sex, citizenship, education, languages spoken or veteran status.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.

What you’ll do

As a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.

Responsibilities


Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


A Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2025, or equivalent work experience
Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts



Preferred Qualifications


One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$104,000 - C$156,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.

The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society however, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.

Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.

The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.

We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of fashion, electronics, software, and data science.

The Role:

We are seeking a highly motivated and versatile clinical scientist to join the Clinical Sciences team of the Science and Technology department. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to contribute to ideation, high-level design, and then testing of medical device prototypes based on e-textiles.

To be successful, the candidate must have a strong background in interacting and collecting data with real-world patients of diverse medical conditions, a perfect mastering of the scientific method and knowledge of the clinical trial methodologies (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods), and experience in the redaction of scientific reports and papers.

Experience with bio-signals and/or low-power wearable systems would be an important asset. Applicants should have a keen eye for solving problems that currently do not have well defined solutions and be able to rapidly design/prototype these ideas.

The successful candidate will join a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, textile experts, fashion designers and entrepreneurs to actively participate in the creation and optimization of new products and should be able to effectively work in multi-disciplinary teams.

Responsibilities:


Research, design, and test for the development of the next generation of smart textiles
Rapid ideation, implementation, and validation of biosignal measuring methods and/or devices
Work closely with a variety of people/teams with different disciplines (mechanical, firmware, data science, software, industrial design, textile, quality assurance, regulatory) and mutually educate each other to allow effective teamwork
Aid in the testing of prototypes and debug issues on the fly
Conducting research and designing protocols to study the attitude towards Myant product and any resulting behavior change
Integrating the Myant products in the care relationship
Capturing user perspectives from elderly, health care professionals, and other adults with and without health conditions
Write, edit, and amend protocol for internal and external testing, in accordance with company's quality control policy and with Research Ethics Board, respectively
Maintain fluid and productive relationships with partners (universities, start-ups, corporations)
Coordinating clinical studies in partnership with other institutions
Participating in Conferences, Webinars and sharing the experience with other teams
Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures and forms relevant to the Clinical Sciences team, in partnership with the regulatory team


Qualifications:


PhD in a field related to Clinical Sciences
Background in Physiotherapy/physical therapy/kinesiology or related discipline is an asset
2-5 years of clinical experience, particularly in geriatric and/or cardiology care
Strong analytical, problem solving, and leadership capabilities
Ability to contribute and work effectively in a fast-paced, multidisciplinary environment
Understanding of biosignals and signal processing techniques would be an important asset

Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.

What you’ll do

As a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.

Responsibilities


Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


A Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2025, or equivalent work experience
Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts



Preferred Qualifications


One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$104,000 - C$156,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.

What you’ll do

As a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.

Responsibilities


Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


A Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2025, or equivalent work experience
Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts



Preferred Qualifications


One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$104,000 - C$156,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

Cockroach Labs is the team behind CockroachDB, the most highly evolved cloud-native, distributed SQL database on the planet. We created CockroachDB and CockroachDB Cloud to deliver the ability to build and scale apps with fewer obstacles, more freedom, and greater efficiency. Today, Cockroach Labs helps companies of all sizes—and the apps they develop—scale fast, survive disaster, and thrive everywhere. Join us on our mission to make data easy.

About The Role

At Cockroach Labs, we strive to deliver a delightful experience to our customers starting from their first interaction with our database. Creating such experiences that make data easy and painless is paramount to our mission. In particular, we are looking for a software engineer to help lead the critical initiative of creating an effortless, seamless customer journey from other database solutions to CockroachDB and our cloud offerings.

In this role, you will create one of the first touchpoints new customers will have with CockroachDB, giving you a front-row seat to our rapid growth. If you bring your expertise and commitment to excellence, we’ll team you up with other talented engineers, SREs, and our product and design teams, as we work together to give developers a platform for their data. You will also have the opportunity to make a significant internal impact by helping establish the culture and practices for engineering at Cockroach Labs.


You Will
Contribute to the growth of CockroachDB by bringing your expertise and commitment to excellence to help build database migration tooling that makes it easy for everyone to migrate to CockroachDB.
Develop in Go, but if you don't know it, you'll learn while you're here.
Work closely with other engineers and product managers across both the cloud and database teams.
Take part in a collaborative culture and exchange knowledge with a highly experienced technical organization.


The Expectations

In the first month you will join your engineering team and start to learn about our production systems, software development workflow, the architecture of CockroachDB, and how our users interact with our offerings. We believe that it's essential for you to take this first month to become familiar with our technology, company, and our culture.

After 3 months you'll be a fully-fledged member of your team and comfortable contributing to CockroachDB’s migration tooling ecosystem. You will begin to determine pain points of the customer migration experience and work with your manager to focus your efforts on projects that align with those areas and our goals.

As our team grows you will have the opportunity to shape the direction of development of the migration tooling for CockroachDB. We want to eliminate the headaches of database migrations for our users and you play a crucial role in making CockroachDB the easiest database migration target. We also offer technical training and experienced mentorship to help you learn and grow into whatever you wish it to be.

You Have


A passion for working on complex technical products and have had exposure to topics such as distributed systems, data replication, concurrency control, file systems, or SQL processing.
Comfort using programming languages like Go, C/C++, Java, and Python.
An understanding of system design.
Experience using one or more database technologies (e.g. MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, SQL Server, Db2, etc).
Experience building collaborative relationships with your colleagues. You enjoy being part of the code review process and partnering with your teammates on challenging problems.
Relevant internship experience (preferred).
A BS in Computer Science or equivalent experience.


The Team

You Will Have The Opportunity To Report To a Member Of Our Engineering Leadership Team Based On The Project You Work On At Cockroach Labs. In Addition, You Will Get To Work Closely With The Senior Leadership Including

Adam Storm - Fellow

Adam is a Fellow at Cockroach Labs. In his more than two decades in the database industry, he's worked on various aspects of database technology including self-managing databases, transaction management, accelerating analytics processing through columnar storage, and novel databases architectures to separate compute and storage. He is a frequent public speaker, and has co-authored a number of academic papers. Currently, Adam is focussed on improving the customer experience of migrating workloads to CockroachDB. When he’s not at work, you can find Adam running, fiddling with some culinary gadget, or spending time doing almost anything with his wife and two daughters.

Isaac Wong - EVP of Engineering

Isaac is responsible for the health of the engineering organization at Cockroach Labs. He partners closely with teams to ensure we have a balanced culture that promotes quality and innovation in pursuit of our goals. Before joining Cockroach Labs Isaac was in life sciences for 16 years with Medidata Solutions where he had a front row seat on the exciting ride from a 30 person startup to more than 2000 people worldwide. But the lure of distributed, resilient, and consistent SQL databases, along with the amazing technology and culture at Cockroach Labs proved too much. When not working he likes to draw, play the piano, and search NYC for cannolis with his wife and kids.

Our Benefits


Competitive Health Insurance Coverage (for you & your dependents!)
Paid Parental Leave (with baby bucks)
Flexible PTO
Learning & Development Budget
Relocation Support (as applicable)


Cockroach Labs is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer building a diverse and inclusive workforce. If you need additional accommodations to feel comfortable during your interview process, please email us at accessibility@cockroachlabs.com.

We can provide all necessary background in chemistry, pharmacology, and biology.




Here is the background we’re looking for:

Ph.D. in CS, applied mathematics, statistics, physics, or related discipline;
Expertise with machine learning techniques, including diffusion models, Transformers, and Bayesian optimization, preferably demonstrated through first-author publications in conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML;

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, 2 Hour Learning. Have you got what it takes?

Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.

At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.

This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.

Who We're Looking For:

We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What You Will Be Doing


Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.

Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.


What You Won’t Be Doing


Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

The yearly total compensation for this senior position ranges from $150,000 to $350,000 CAD.

From designing our data models to implementing the subtle interaction behaviors that differentiate good software from great software. We work closely with UX Designers, Product Managers, and Data Scientists throughout the entire product process, from conception to post-launch reflection.

We are looking for a Software Engineer to join the Login & Signup (LNS) team in our Vancouver Office. The LNS team is responsible for handling the registration and authentication of Asana's users, with emphasis on secure login for enterprise accounts, such as single sign-on through Identity Providers (Okta, OneLogin, Google SSO, etc.) and multi-factor authentication. It is a full-stack team; tech stack includes TypeScript/React and some Scala.

In enterprise applications, user account management and login is a challenging, multi-faceted technical space encompassing software security, compliance to industry standards and legal regulations, large-scale IT administration needs, and quality of end-user experience. LNS' goal is to create and maintain a best-in-class registration and authentication system for Asana: we want it to be compliant with the most recent security standards and regulations, safe for enterprises to adopt, fully integrated with leading identity management frameworks, while offering the most delightful, smooth and seamless user experience.

You’ll advocate for engineering best practices and work cross-functionally to define and build powerful admin features while influencing the team's velocity. You'll mentor other engineers and advocate for code and component quality, reusability, and consistency; and you'll be at the forefront of a new wave of consumer-like experiences for the enterprise and enjoy the challenge of balancing speed of execution with quality and building a product that users love.

This role is based in Vancouver, with an office-centric hybrid schedule. The standard in-office days are Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Most Asanas have the option to work from home on Wednesdays. Working from home on Fridays depends on the type of work you do and the teams with which you partner. If you're interviewing for this role, your recruiter will share more about the in-office requirements.

What You’ll Achieve


Work in a high-performance, dynamic team with a strong focus on velocity and software quality and people's professional development
Contribute to building a complex SaaS application that is a market leader in its segment
Collaborate with Product Managers and customers to understand the needs of IT admins of large enterprises, and identify features to satisfy those needs
Partner with our Product Security team to stay updated about security threats, vulnerabilities, and cutting-edge countermeasures to protect SaaS applications
Learn about state-of-the-art technologies, including single-sign on methods and integration with Identity Providers such as Okta and Azure AD
Drive large, impactful projects, delivering features rolled out and used in large organizations


About You


Experience driving projects of medium complexity autonomously and reliably, planning tasks through milestones and workstreams, coordinating multiple engineers, and delivering successfully and on time
Interested in working in a highly technical space, learn about state of the art registration and authentication technologies, and software security
Passion for software architecture and software quality
Strong commitment to building the best UX to delight consumer and enterprise users
Continuous improvement mindset and a drive to enhance the architecture, the code, and team processes
Enthusiasm for mentoring and coaching teammates and stakeholders and contributing to team growth
Relevant experience in the tech stack (React, Typescript, Scala, SQL) as well as in UX design are nice-to-haves
Relevant industry experience in authorization and software security is a big plus; if you hold this experience, make sure to emphasize it in your application


At Asana, we're committed to building teams that include a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, as this is critical to helping us achieve our mission. If you're interested in this role and don't meet every listed requirement, we still encourage you to apply.

What We’ll Offer

Our comprehensive compensation package plays a big part in how we recognize you for the impact you have on our path to achieving our mission. We believe that compensation should be reflective of the value you create relative to the market value of your role. To ensure pay is fair and not impacted by biases, we're committed to looking at market value which is why we check ourselves and conduct a yearly pay equity audit.

For this role, the estimated base salary range is between $146,000 - $178,000 CAD.

Traditional approaches require over ten years and two billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical, and their reliance on trial-and-error calls out for better predictive and generative models. The existent datasets are large enough to benefit from sophisticated deep learning architectures, but small enough that ML models can be trained in a few days on a single GPU, facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation. Nevertheless, the current industry standard has progressed little beyond shallow ML techniques such as random forests and support vector machines, largely due to the difficulty of integrating world-class machine learning research with chemistry and pharmacology expertise.




Variational AI is searching for machine learning scientists to join us in our quest to radically accelerate the development of new drugs through machine learning excellence. Over the past five years, we have been advancing the state-of-the-art, and delivering projects to customers such as Merck. You will help us design, implement, test, and refine novel elements of a machine learning architecture built from the ground up to optimize the properties of small molecule drugs; continually improve the robustness of our existing code base; and apply our pipeline to new drug targets. We can provide all necessary background in chemistry, pharmacology, and biology.




Here is the background we’re looking for:

Ph.D. in CS, applied mathematics, statistics, physics, or related discipline;
Expertise with machine learning techniques, including diffusion models, Transformers, and Bayesian optimization, preferably demonstrated through first-author publications in conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML;
Two or more years’ experience developing robust code on larger projects, including code review, refactoring, unit testing, version control, etc.;
Mastery of Python and PyTorch; and
Intellectual curiosity and drive to excel.




We are an equal opportunity employer and enthusiastically welcome applications from women, BIPOC, and members of underrepresented communities and groups. Compensation is a competitive mix of cash and options. We prioritize expertise and passion over where you decide to live and work. Please send resumes/CVs to info@variational.ai.
