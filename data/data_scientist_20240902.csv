The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

We’re working with a tier-one hedge fund as they continue to scale their Data Science capabilities. Despite what was a challenging year for many in the markets this firm came out with double-digit gains and is continuing to scale for 2024.

It’s a given this role has technical elements but equally as important is the ability to communicate your analysis and really look to monetize that. As they look to monetize the data, creativity surrounding the data and analysis is very much encouraged. They need someone who enjoys the technical elements but also wants to combine them with the fundamentals of working close to the markets.




As a senior hire you will lead the most impactful projects, you will also play a part in mentoring some of the junior team members.




Who you are:

Do you like to create insights and turn them into action to create lasting impact? We are searching for an experienced Data Scientist for our Data & AI team to support our clients by combining business sense with data modelling. If this description fits your profile, we are looking for you!

The Data & AI team at IG&H is using the latest data and AI technology to help our clients innovate. To do so, our team of 25 data experts works closely together with our Technology and Sector teams. Through smart collaboration, we have delivered over 40 (Gen)AI projects in the last two years for our clients in Retail, Healthcare and Financial Services. As a Data Scientist, you will play a central role in truly understanding our client’s needs, translating this into value, creating solutions, developing Gen(AI) models and turning them into action. We believe it is key to have business sense as well as broad experience with data related topics (analytics, artificial intelligence, etc.) to create real business value. On top of that, you need to be able to communicate clearly and convincingly. Not only for effective project execution, but also to inspire (internal) stakeholders on the latest trends and developments in the field of Data and AI.

You will typically work in multidisciplinary project teams for one project at a time. Although being able to deliver work independently is appreciated, involvement of a project manager and technical experts ensures high-quality delivery and facilitates you to maintain a steep learning curve. We believe in diverse teams and diverse profiles in our Data & AI team. Some of our Data Scientists develop to be great consultants with technical knowledge and execution power, while others focus more on gaining deep technical expertise to deliver value from there. Working on a different range of projects in different sectors, you’ll be able to find your own sweet spot.

In addition, we believe that a caring and fun working environment will help you to dare to step out of your comfort zone and learn. We offer continuous learning through the IG&H Academy, in which you will get trainings to boost your data science, consulting and people skills. Also, you will be assigned a mentor, who will be there for you to provide you with guidance.

Above all, people are at the heart of what we do. This of course comes back in the work we deliver for our clients (why make a data product if the people who need to use it do not understand or want to use it?). At the same time, a fun working culture is key for who we are. With an inspiring office in Utrecht where we can connect, have abundant parties, team activities and sport events (both organized for the entire IG&H organization as well as specifically for the Data & Analytics team), IG&H is truly a Great Place To Work. And yes, we are certified!

Working for the Data & AI Team at IG&H Consulting is incredibly diverse, and fun at the same time. It’s been a great place to develop my technical know-how, management consulting skills and commercial effectivity. The team is young and ambitious, with a strong desire to solve complex puzzles, develop personally & professionally and do fun activities together. All in all, IG&H has been a great place to work for over 6 years already!

Our platform replicates the human immune system in a dish across populations to discover cures at a pace never seen before. Come join us on our mission to flip the 95% drug failure rate to a 95% success rate.

What we do:

Our immune systems are master regulators of health and disease. Current tools used to discover drugs that target the immune system are wildly inadequate. To fix this critical gap, Parallel Bio created a human 'immune system in a dish' to rapidly accelerate the development of new drugs and immunotherapies more likely to work in patients. This is the first step on our journey to build a new type of biopharma by reimagining the way we cure disease. Our mission is to design and engineer breakthrough tools inspired by human biology, starting with replacing ineffectual mouse and synthetic platforms.

Who you are:

You are someone excited about what we are doing at Parallel Bio and have a scientific background. Please submit your information here if you have a background in the following:


Have held a position like junior scientist, principal scientist, data scientist, Head of R&D, Head of Biology
A concentration or background in Immunology, Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Data Science and more


Why work with us:

As experts in human drug discovery, we have worked hard to position the company for success and to expand our team. We are funded by some of the world's best investors: Y Combinator, Refactor Capital, Breakout Ventures, leaders from pharma, tech, government, and more. You're joining an incredibly ambitious team at an early enough time to help us define our culture, choices, and impact success. We will have the highest expectations of you, just as we do of ourselves. Join us in re-imagining what's possible with immunotherapy!

We are building a diverse, interdisciplinary team of dreamers and doers. Forget incrementalism and leave low-risk ideas at the door. We're looking for fellow visionaries hungry for real impact in reimagining every facet of how we cure disease. Some of our values: first principles thinking, burning passion, and a drive to work with people with like-minded values; thinking outside the box and the ability to envision that which has not yet been built; listen, then talk; don't forget to have fun; cooperation, trust, ethics, and transparency.

Verily is a subsidiary of Alphabet that is using a data-driven approach to change the way people manage their health and the way healthcare is delivered. Launched from Google X in 2015, our purpose is to bring the promise of precision health to everyone, every day. We are focused on generating and activating data from a variety of sources, including clinical, social, behavioral and the real world, to arrive at the best solutions for a person based on a comprehensive view of the evidence. Our unique expertise and capabilities in technology, data science and healthcare enable the entire healthcare ecosystem to drive better health outcomes.

Description

As a Data Scientist on our Registries and RWD (real-world data) team, you will be supporting our core mission to drive innovation in evidence generation for research and care decisions. We are building new types of longitudinal datasets that have foundations of RWD sources, such as EHRs (electronic health records) and claims data, and are augmented with prospective data collection. You will develop and deploy models that enable scalable curation of RWD. This will include multi-source integrations and reconciliations, creating derived features from the source data (e.g., abstraction of clinical concepts from unstructured data), and facilitating data quality assessments. You will work with a diverse cross-functional team to build reusable and scalable tools and to deliver products that unlock information from structured and unstructured clinical data.

Responsibilities


Work closely with cross-functional partners to design and create longitudinal datasets integrating multiple data sources.
Build and implement highly accurate machine learning models / AI tools using sparsely labeled healthcare datasets.
Implement, build on and augment existing LLM/NLP tools to maximize the value of using unstructured medical data across a range of research and care applications.
Become an expert in our data’s capabilities and limitations. Solve difficult, non-routine analysis problems, handling data challenges from a real-world setting.
Communicate technical methods and results clearly in well structured reports and presentations to a range of technical and non-technical audiences.


Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications


Advanced degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., data sciences, statistics, biomedical informatics, computer science, applied mathematics, or similar), or equivalent practical experience.
2+ years experience applying advanced machine learning and AI techniques (supervised and unsupervised methods, LLMs, NLP) to clinical data.
Direct experience working with and curating real-world data, such as EHR, including a deep understanding of the complexities of this structured and unstructured clinical data.
Strong proficiency in Python.


Preferred Qualifications


Familiarity with medical terminologies and ontologies.
Familiarity with software engineering practices and experience developing production software.
Experience working with clinical subject matter experts.
Ability to work cross-functionally on teams, with a tolerance for ambiguity.
Creative and methodical problem solving: understand needs, identify options, form hypotheses, generate robust results, make informed decisions, and learn faster through feedback.


The US base salary range for this full-time position is $119,000 - $169,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. The range displayed on each job posting reflects the minimum and maximum target for new hire salaries for the position across all US locations.

Who You Are

&#55357;&#56425;‍&#55357;&#56507; You are self-directed. You are insatiably curious. You can be counted on to work through a project, commit and go deep while seeking help when you need it, and propel it forward without hand-holding.

&#55357;&#56528; You are fastidious and meticulous in your work. You will put in the time to make an order from chaos. You’ve looked into the eye of Sauron and lived to make a graph. You don’t mind doing the “grunt work” to build up to the full picture, or go as low as it takes? Muckraking? More like fun-making.

&#55356;&#57256; You're creative and you aren't afraid to be wrong.

&#10052;&#65039; You are super comfortable in SQL-like databases (we use Snowflake)

®&#65039; You are intimately familiar with R for analysis, exploration, and model-building. And you have an opinion about data. table vs dplyr. Python is OK too, but we have a lot of R code, so you need to be comfortable there.

&#55356;&#57331;&#65039;‍&#55356;&#57096; You take pride in your code. It's readable, functional, and reproducible. You commit regularly for all the right reasons.

Who You Are

&#55358;&#56814; You love data and stats. You know some formal statistics, ML, and data exploration techniques, even better if you’ve done network analysis.

&#55357;&#56988; You love crypto and DeFi, know the difference between hodling, staking, and yield farming, and you have used both Ethereum and other chains.

&#55357;&#56425;‍&#55357;&#56507; You are self-directed. You are insatiably curious. You can be counted on to work through a project, commit and go deep while seeking help when you need it, and propel it forward without hand-holding.

&#55357;&#56528; You are fastidious and meticulous in your work. You will put in the time to make an order from chaos. You’ve looked into the eye of Sauron and lived to make a graph. You don’t mind doing the “grunt work” to build up to the full picture, or go as low as it takes? Muckraking? More like fun-making.

&#55356;&#57256; You're creative and you aren't afraid to be wrong.

&#10052;&#65039; You are super comfortable in SQL-like databases (we use Snowflake)

®&#65039; You are intimately familiar with R for analysis, exploration, and model-building. And you have an opinion about data. table vs dplyr. Python is OK too, but we have a lot of R code, so you need to be comfortable there.

&#55356;&#57331;&#65039;‍&#55356;&#57096; You take pride in your code. It's readable, functional, and reproducible. You commit regularly for all the right reasons.

&#55358;&#56785;‍&#55356;&#57323; You can describe a complex problem (or solution) in a way that doesn't put people to sleep and doesn't leave them scratching their heads.

What You'll Work On

Work directly with the company's community, our internal analytics & data platform teams.

Collaborate with other data scientists and analysts to explore, visualize, and validate our data.

Work closely with our marketing team to share what we learn with the world, and educate anyone who wants to learn more.

Support the efforts of our product teams to help transform our apps into more data-driven, web3-connected, powerful experiences for our growing base of thousands of users.

Desired Experience

Experience with Crypto/Blockchain is a requirement.

Prior experience as an analyst or data scientist, working directly with database-level data, whether formally or self-taught.

At least 2 years in a formal data science role, ideally working primarily in R

Experience working with product & marketing teams, developers, and data engineers

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us.

          <strong>Company Description<br><br></strong>Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square.

Gecko Robotics is helping the world’s most important organizations ensure the availability, reliability, and sustainability of critical infrastructure. Gecko's complete and connected solutions combine wall-climbing robots, industry-leading sensors, and an AI-powered data platform to provide customers

with a unique window into the current and future health of their physical assets. This enables real-time decision making to increase the efficiency and safety of operations, promote mission readiness, and protect the environment and civilization from the effects of infrastructure failure.

Gecko Robotics is currently hiring new graduates to begin full-time in Spring or Summer of 2025.

About The Role

Gecko’s software teams come into the picture after our robots and operators collect data in the field. The petabytes of data our robots collect are only valuable and useful if we as humans (and our software tools) are able to understand the story the inspections are telling. The Software Organization’s work bridges multiple data layers and functions, ultimately converging in our transformative Cantilever software that directly impacts critical maintenance and repair decision making worldwide.

In our recently opened Boston Habitat, we have a variety of teams that you may be able to add value to! Future Geckos that join our software teams are placed based on their strengths, interests, and needs of our business. This process happens as your start date arrives!

Here are some brief descriptions of possible teams you can make an impact on.


Data Systems - The Data Systems team creates the software needed to turn raw inspection data into deliverables for customers, develop pipelines that perform automated processing, and empower our internal data analysis team with tools to manually process datasets more efficiently and accurately.
Enterprise - The Enterprise Team is responsible for Gecko’s customer facing, business-to-business, enterprise software. The team also claims that they make the ‘prettiest’ applications at Gecko.
Rolodex - The Rolodex Team builds and maintains a unified data model for all of Gecko, and drives data governance as we grow and scale.
Platform - The Software Platform team’s purpose is to empower software engineers, reduce unnecessary blockers, and increase our velocity to create exceptional products. They do this by making software effortless to build, deploy, and manage.


What You Will Do

The Software Engineering team operates in a highly collaborative environment to design, code, and ship the features that unlock insights and value from the huge volumes of data collected by Gecko robots everyday. The software team also works collaboratively with other teams within Gecko to build features that make it easy to transform and use data across the organization, as well as better serve the needs of our customers. As a member of this team you will leverage software to enable data-driven decision making and clean reporting, build new aspects to improve the structure of our existing data, and create the foundation for future software development at Gecko.

Technologies We Use

We use a variety of technologies, but we primarily operate using Python, React, and Typescript with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as our cloud provider. This is a non-exhaustive list and we are tech agnostic in our interview process, so we encourage you to apply regardless of your background.
