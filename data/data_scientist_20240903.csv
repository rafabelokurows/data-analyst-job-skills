Über uns

Mit autarc entwickeln wir das führende Betriebssystem (OS) für Wärmepumpen-Installateure. Wusstest Du, dass 25% der CO2-Emissionen in Europa durch das Heizen unserer Gebäude verursacht werden? Das Problem: Es gibt zu wenige Installateure, um den wachsenden Bedarf an Wärmepumpen zu decken. Deshalb haben wir es uns zur Aufgabe gemacht, die Abwicklung von Wärmepumpen-Projekten für Handwerker deutlich digitaler, effizienter und einfacher zu gestalten. Mit autarc verringern wir gezielt die Hürden, um Einfamilienhäuser und kleine Mehrfamilienhäuser in Europa zu dekarbonisieren. Wir unterstützen Installateure dabei, sicher und problemlos auf Wärmepumpen umzusteigen.

About Merchant Group at Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business. Their core mission is to provide merchants with self-service tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use.

About The Merchant Analytics Team

Merchant Analytics is an embedded analytics function within the Merchant Group. The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

AI is transforming everything, and we make sure the right people are ahead of the curve. We do so by creating AI breakthroughs with our clients.




For us, creating breakthroughs is an irresistible adventure that we want to do 1000 times over. That’s why we are called One Thousand. And as a profitable, fast-growing company, we are on track as never before!




To create AI breakthroughs, our team of 15 friendly nerds identifies pain points and solves them with fast-paced MVPs. And: We enable the broader transformation of our clients into an AI powerhouse.




If you are keen to help Europe finally speed up in AI and would love to have warm outliers around you, join us now! We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer (m/w/d) who identifies with most of the following:




What we care about

Inherent Drive for Greatness: Our world-class team of outliers ships AI breakthroughs extremely fast while ensuring quality standards are met. We are people who feel like they still have something to prove – and we do so by working on something 1000x greater than us.
Relentless Resourcefulness: Creating AI breakthroughs requires the ability to thrive in uncertainty. We have the strength to bounce back and a tenacity to keep pushing to go where it hurts. We balance persistence with lightness.
Infectious Enthusiasm: We care about making AI a blast for everyone involved. With electrifying empathy, we propel our clients forward in understanding, building, and thriving with AI and boost our team with the opportunity to shape our future.




What the role is about

You will have the chance to shape fast-paced AI breakthrough projects. You will ensure our Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) are productionized as MVPs to generate business value.
You will be responsible for building data pipelines, running ML workflows, developing web services, deploying them on cloud environments, and supporting integration with our clients’ systems.
You will be a key contributor in growing our high-impact start-up and shaping our identity – both internally and externally.
You will be working not only with corporates but also be bringing AI to large international NGOs, the “Mittelstand,” scale-ups, unions, or the public sector.
You will have the chance to fully be yourself and will be embraced if you respect the others :-)




What we would love to see

Knowing how to execute real-life software projects: You have at least 3 years of experience in building scalable software projects in a professional manner.
Leveraging AI Expertise: You have hands-on experience implementing machine learning models in production environments, including model training, deployment, and monitoring. You are proficient with machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn) and understand the full ML lifecycle, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and optimization. You thrive on solving practical ML problems and are comfortable working within a team to deliver impactful solutions.
Bringing technical depth: You can solve diverse software engineering challenges with a flexible toolbox and love fostering good quality code. You have a strong foundation in Python and SQL. Besides that, you have experience with setting up secure web applications (e.g., working with SSL certificates). You bring experience with RDBMS (preferably PostgreSQL) and with at least one cloud platform (preferably, Microsoft Azure), too.
Being dedicated: You don't have to master everything, yet you fully support the team to reach our goals in a result-oriented way of working while fostering a culture of caring.
Dealing with ambiguity: Even if some challenges are vaguely defined, you make sense of what needs to be done.




Ideally, you also bring the following

Ability to communicate in German with level B2 or higher.
Experience with data science tools (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, ...).
Experience working with LLMs (OpenAI / Claude API).
Experience in building front-end solutions.
Experience with Docker.
Experience integrating web services with SAP.
Openness to travel to clients location 2-3 times a month.




What we offer

Ascension – as we are going to push and enable you to do the best work of your life.
Anti-Mimeticism – as we are on the journey to 1000 AI breakthroughs since long before the recent hype.
Captivating AI breakthrough projects with a lot of room for personal development, experimentation, continuous learning, and growth.
A unique role in a pioneering AI company with autonomy in shaping and leading key endeavors that contribute to the advancement of AI applications.
A professional, yet flexible work environment, innovative work practices along “No rules rules,” and continuous mutual support.
A value-driven business with top-of-market pay for a Machine Learning Engineer.
All the other start-up stuff such as free drinks and snacks, game nights, ...




We are determined to foster and embrace diversity – not just among our clients but especially within our own walls. We believe that this will make our organisation and quality of work better, but more importantly, we strongly believe it is the right thing to do.




Sounds like a “wow” opportunity? You would like to get to know us and the One Thousand better? Great – we can’t wait to hear from you! Please apply via LinkedIn.

About the Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has got Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Develop and automate forecasting models to plan the capacity of the support centers across different locations.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track scheduling efficiency, occupancy rates, and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building forecasting models & time series analysis (Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters or similar).
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in Cost Analysis, What-if Scenario Analysis, Capacity planning, and Workforce Management is nice to have but not mandatory.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

About the Team

The Selection Analytics Team at Wolt owns the data and infrastructure that helps all 27 of our markets build a portfolio of high-quality restaurant and retail merchants. Our overarching mission is to provide the best selection to customers by enabling sales teams across all markets to acquire the best merchants.

To do this, we work directly with country sales teams to help them identify and prioritize the highest potential merchant candidates. We also work with Wolt leadership by providing metrics to track selection quality, upon which they develop strategic initiatives and goals. This is a lean and mighty team that owns and operates the engine for merchant acquisition globally.

About The Role

As a senior member of the Selection Analytics team, your role involves leveling up our approach to identifying and prioritizing better merchants. You’ll achieve this by a) developing metrics to unlock deeper insights into merchant selection quality for all markets b) developing and running experiments to understand the impact of selection on specific markets c) develop self-serve tooling to track these insights

This is also a rare, high-exposure experience where you will then use your findings to work directly with country leadership to help them uncover growth opportunities. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just crunching numbers and creating dashboards.

The team is looking for a versatile analytics expert who knows how to move fast, work cross-functionally, and deliver business results. If you are excited to build from 0 to 1, interested in global exposure, and have experience using deep analytics to solve hard problems - we're looking for someone like you.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these cities - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.

Our humble expectations


3-5 years of experience in data science, consulting, or related quantitative role
Strong exploratory data analysis skills, willingness to look under the hood.
Deep understanding of the data science workflow, including experimental design and key statistical methods, with strong communication skills for complex topics.
Proficiency in statistical programming languages (R, Python, etc.) and SQL.
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g. Looker)
Determination to initiate and lead/own strategic projects to completion in a scrappy environment with a cross-functional team
Innate curiosity to understand how things work and a first-principles approach to problem solving


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Lead - Marta Palac (marta.palac@wolt.com).

About Wolt

Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers. It connects people looking to order food and other goods with people interested in selling and delivering them. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions – as well as operating its own grocery stores under the Wolt Market brand. Wolt’s products include Wolt+ (subscription service for customers), Wolt for Work (meal benefits and office deliveries for companies), Wolt Drive (fast last-mile deliveries for merchants) and Wolt Self-Delivery (service for merchant partners with their own delivery staff). Wolt’s mission is to make cities better by empowering and growing local communities. Wolt was founded in 2014 and joined forces with DoorDash in 2022. DoorDash operates in 29 countries today, 25 of which are with the Wolt product and brand.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 700+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 60 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together.

At Trade Republic, we are on a mission to empower everyone to create wealth with easy, safe and free access to the financial system. With over four million customers we are the largest savings platforms in Europe, with users holding over €35 billion on our platform.

We are seen as the go-to-destination for top talent from across the globe. Everyday we strive to make Trade Republic a great environment to do the best work of your life, surrounded by exceptional, caring and passionate colleagues. In addition to learning and growing with a world-class team, you will build a destination for millions of people across Europe to create wealth.




ABOUT THE TEAM




At Trade Republic, safeguarding our customers and fortifying our company against malicious actors isn't just a goal - it's an imperative.




Our Fincrime team leads the charge in proactively preventing, detecting, and halting any form of exploitation aimed at our products or our valued clientele. To achieve this, we recognize that data isn't just a resource - it's a cornerstone.




As a Senior Data Scientist on our Fincrime team, you're not just another cog in the machine. You are an integral part of a tight-knit team that truly owns the services and technical products it develops. You won't just build and maintain data products; you will have end-to-end ownership of them. This goes beyond mere maintenance or feature updates; it's about being fully accountable for your products' lifecycle - from ideation and scoping with product managers to final integration and ongoing evaluation with our engineering teams.




Please note that the position will either be based in London or Berlin, depending on your availability.




WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING




Own the Roadmap: Plan and execute the roadmap for your services together with the team
Architectural Influence: Play a pivotal role in designing the architecture of your data products, ensuring they are scalable, robust, and synergistic with our existing platforms.
Technical Excellence: Research, build, test and deploy models - this is where you will spend most of your time. With a focus on team ownership, this gives a lot of time for our developers and data scientists to actually work technically instead of with process.
Technical Leadership: Serve as a mentor to other engineers and establish yourself as a subject-matter expert within the team, lending your expertise to solve deeply complex issues in the fintech security landscape.
Accountability and Monitoring : Once deployed, you will continue to oversee your products, monitoring their performance metrics and making data-driven adjustments as needed to optimise results.




WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR




We are aware that everyone has their individual strengths and weaknesses. The one thing where we don’t compromise is joy for our work and dedication to our shared mission. If you feel you are not ticking all the boxes below, but have a good general feeling about most of them, we would be very happy to talk!




We recommend you have at least 5 years of end-to-end data science and software engineering experience, preferably in a dynamic environment with a modern tech stack
Experience working in the Financial domain, specifically significant experience in Anti Financial Crime is a must
Strong business acumen in the areas of finance and product
Exceptional interpersonal and communication skills, both with engineers and business stakeholders
Experience with applying a wide variety of machine learning techniques to business problems, particularly with tabular and natural language data
Strong command of SQL, Python together with its scientific stack (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
Good understanding of Software Engineering practices (e.g. test-driven development, OOP, CI/CD, etc.) and experience with productionizing ML products




WHY YOU SHOULD APPLY NOW




At Trade Republic you will get to do the best work of your career. We are a destination for people who are exceptional at what they do. Every day, we strive to build a world-class team and provide the space for people to do their best. We have a relentless ambition of raising the bar and expect the best from ourselves. Through our dedicated people-first management approach and transparent career paths, you will have the opportunity to develop and grow your career like never before. And because you are surrounded by a diverse team of high performers, you will be learning every day.




You will play an important role in fixing one of the largest challenges we face - closing the pension gap and democratizing wealth. Trade Republic is a place where your job, your career and your passions intersect. If this gets you fired up, just like it does for all of us at Trade Republic, then reach out!




Trade Republic embraces diversity and strives for equal opportunity for everyone. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, characteristics, perspectives and skills. We encourage applicants of diverse gender, age, sexuality, religion, ethnicity, disability status and parental status to apply to our roles, or those from other intersecting minority groups not listed. The more diverse and inclusive we are as a team, the greater our work will be. If we can support you on DEI related questions during the interview process, please reach out to talentacquisition@traderepublic.com.

About the Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has got Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Develop and automate forecasting models to plan the capacity of the support centers across different locations.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track scheduling efficiency, occupancy rates, and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building forecasting models & time series analysis (Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters or similar).
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in Cost Analysis, What-if Scenario Analysis, Capacity planning, and Workforce Management is nice to have but not mandatory.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

AI is transforming everything, and we make sure the right people are ahead of the curve. We do so by creating AI breakthroughs with our clients.




For us, creating breakthroughs is an irresistible adventure that we want to do 1000 times over. That’s why we are called One Thousand. And as a profitable, fast-growing company, we are on track as never before!




To create AI breakthroughs, our team of 15 friendly nerds identifies pain points and solves them with fast-paced MVPs. And: We enable the broader transformation of our clients into an AI powerhouse.




If you are keen to help Europe finally speed up in AI and would love to have warm outliers around you, join us now! We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer (m/w/d) who identifies with most of the following:




What we care about

Inherent Drive for Greatness: Our world-class team of outliers ships AI breakthroughs extremely fast while ensuring quality standards are met. We are people who feel like they still have something to prove – and we do so by working on something 1000x greater than us.
Relentless Resourcefulness: Creating AI breakthroughs requires the ability to thrive in uncertainty. We have the strength to bounce back and a tenacity to keep pushing to go where it hurts. We balance persistence with lightness.
Infectious Enthusiasm: We care about making AI a blast for everyone involved. With electrifying empathy, we propel our clients forward in understanding, building, and thriving with AI and boost our team with the opportunity to shape our future.




What the role is about

You will have the chance to shape fast-paced AI breakthrough projects. You will ensure our Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) are productionized as MVPs to generate business value.
You will be responsible for building data pipelines, running ML workflows, developing web services, deploying them on cloud environments, and supporting integration with our clients’ systems.
You will be a key contributor in growing our high-impact start-up and shaping our identity – both internally and externally.
You will be working not only with corporates but also be bringing AI to large international NGOs, the “Mittelstand,” scale-ups, unions, or the public sector.
You will have the chance to fully be yourself and will be embraced if you respect the others :-)

You thrive on solving practical ML problems and are comfortable working within a team to deliver impactful solutions.
Bringing technical depth: You can solve diverse software engineering challenges with a flexible toolbox and love fostering good quality code. You have a strong foundation in Python and SQL. Besides that, you have experience with setting up secure web applications (e.g., working with SSL certificates). You bring experience with RDBMS (preferably PostgreSQL) and with at least one cloud platform (preferably, Microsoft Azure), too.
Being dedicated: You don't have to master everything, yet you fully support the team to reach our goals in a result-oriented way of working while fostering a culture of caring.
Dealing with ambiguity: Even if some challenges are vaguely defined, you make sense of what needs to be done.




Ideally, you also bring the following

Ability to communicate in German with level B2 or higher.
Experience with data science tools (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, ...).
Experience working with LLMs (OpenAI / Claude API).
Experience in building front-end solutions.
Experience with Docker.
Experience integrating web services with SAP.
Openness to travel to clients location 2-3 times a month.




What we offer

Ascension – as we are going to push and enable you to do the best work of your life.
Anti-Mimeticism – as we are on the journey to 1000 AI breakthroughs since long before the recent hype.
Captivating AI breakthrough projects with a lot of room for personal development, experimentation, continuous learning, and growth.
A unique role in a pioneering AI company with autonomy in shaping and leading key endeavors that contribute to the advancement of AI applications.
A professional, yet flexible work environment, innovative work practices along “No rules rules,” and continuous mutual support.
A value-driven business with top-of-market pay for a Machine Learning Engineer.
All the other start-up stuff such as free drinks and snacks, game nights, ...




We are determined to foster and embrace diversity – not just among our clients but especially within our own walls. We believe that this will make our organisation and quality of work better, but more importantly, we strongly believe it is the right thing to do.




Sounds like a “wow” opportunity? You would like to get to know us and the One Thousand better? Great – we can’t wait to hear from you! Please apply via LinkedIn.

Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few roles based in offices. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder led, profitable and growing.

We are hiring an AI/ML and MLOps Field Engineer to help global companies embrace AI in their business, using the latest open source capabilities on public and private cloud infrastructure, Linux and Kubernetes. Our team applies expert insights to real-world customer problems, enabling the enterprise adoption of Ubuntu, Kubeflow, MLFlow, Feast, DVC and related analytics, machine learning and data technologies. We are working to create the world's best open source data platform, covering traditional SQL databases and today's NoSQL data stores, as well as the machinery which turns data into insights and executable models.

The people who love this role are software engineers who enjoy customer conversations and solving customer problems during the presales cycle. They are are developers who like to solve customer problems through architecture, presentations and training. Ubuntu is used by pretty much every enterprise in the world, in every industry. This is a fantastic opportunity to learn about the open source technology landscape and develop your business technology insights. You will see first hand in various industries how Linux - and Ubuntu in particular - is shaping innovation and changing the world for the better.

This role is particularly suited to candidates with a technical background who are business minded and driven by commercial success. This role is on our global Field Engineering team and will work closely with enterprise sales leads. We are specifically looking for people interested in solving the most difficult problems in modern data architectures. Training LLMs on multiple K8s clusters deployed on a hybrid cloud infrastructure with GPU sharing across multiple teams? Processing 10M events in real time for financial transactions? Object detection on 10k parallel 4K video streams? These are the problems we solve day to day.

Location: Most of our colleagues work from home. We are growing teams in EMEA, Americas and APAC time zones, so can accommodate candidates from almost any country.

What your day will look like

The global Field Engineering team members are Linux and cloud solutions architects for our customers, designing private and public cloud solutions fitting their workload needs. They are the cloud consultants who work hands-on with the technologies by deploying, testing and handing over the solution to our support or managed services team at the end of a project. They are also software engineers who use Python to develop Kubernetes operators and Linux open source infrastructure-as-code.


Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Architect cloud infrastructure solutions like Kubernetes, Kubeflow, OpenStack, and Spark
Deliver solutions either on-premise or in public cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
Collect customer business requirements and advise them on Ubuntu and relevant open source applications
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with the company values
Deliver presentations and demonstrations of Ubuntu Pro and AI/ML capabilities to prospective and current clients

At Trade Republic, we are on a mission to empower everyone to create wealth with easy, safe and free access to the financial system. With over four million customers we are the largest savings platforms in Europe, with users holding over €35 billion on our platform.

We are seen as the go-to-destination for top talent from across the globe. Everyday we strive to make Trade Republic a great environment to do the best work of your life, surrounded by exceptional, caring and passionate colleagues. In addition to learning and growing with a world-class team, you will build a destination for millions of people across Europe to create wealth.




ABOUT THE TEAM




At Trade Republic, safeguarding our customers and fortifying our company against malicious actors isn't just a goal - it's an imperative.




Our Fincrime team leads the charge in proactively preventing, detecting, and halting any form of exploitation aimed at our products or our valued clientele. To achieve this, we recognize that data isn't just a resource - it's a cornerstone.




As a Senior Data Scientist on our Fincrime team, you're not just another cog in the machine. You are an integral part of a tight-knit team that truly owns the services and technical products it develops. You won't just build and maintain data products; you will have end-to-end ownership of them. This goes beyond mere maintenance or feature updates; it's about being fully accountable for your products' lifecycle - from ideation and scoping with product managers to final integration and ongoing evaluation with our engineering teams.




Please note that the position will either be based in London or Berlin, depending on your availability.




WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING




Own the Roadmap: Plan and execute the roadmap for your services together with the team
Architectural Influence: Play a pivotal role in designing the architecture of your data products, ensuring they are scalable, robust, and synergistic with our existing platforms.
Technical Excellence: Research, build, test and deploy models - this is where you will spend most of your time. With a focus on team ownership, this gives a lot of time for our developers and data scientists to actually work technically instead of with process.
Technical Leadership: Serve as a mentor to other engineers and establish yourself as a subject-matter expert within the team, lending your expertise to solve deeply complex issues in the fintech security landscape.
Accountability and Monitoring : Once deployed, you will continue to oversee your products, monitoring their performance metrics and making data-driven adjustments as needed to optimise results.




WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR




We are aware that everyone has their individual strengths and weaknesses. The one thing where we don’t compromise is joy for our work and dedication to our shared mission. If you feel you are not ticking all the boxes below, but have a good general feeling about most of them, we would be very happy to talk!




We recommend you have at least 5 years of end-to-end data science and software engineering experience, preferably in a dynamic environment with a modern tech stack
Experience working in the Financial domain, specifically significant experience in Anti Financial Crime is a must
Strong business acumen in the areas of finance and product
Exceptional interpersonal and communication skills, both with engineers and business stakeholders
Experience with applying a wide variety of machine learning techniques to business problems, particularly with tabular and natural language data
Strong command of SQL, Python together with its scientific stack (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
Good understanding of Software Engineering practices (e.g. test-driven development, OOP, CI/CD, etc.) and experience with productionizing ML products




WHY YOU SHOULD APPLY NOW




At Trade Republic you will get to do the best work of your career. We are a destination for people who are exceptional at what they do. Every day, we strive to build a world-class team and provide the space for people to do their best. We have a relentless ambition of raising the bar and expect the best from ourselves. Through our dedicated people-first management approach and transparent career paths, you will have the opportunity to develop and grow your career like never before. And because you are surrounded by a diverse team of high performers, you will be learning every day.




You will play an important role in fixing one of the largest challenges we face - closing the pension gap and democratizing wealth. Trade Republic is a place where your job, your career and your passions intersect. If this gets you fired up, just like it does for all of us at Trade Republic, then reach out!




Trade Republic embraces diversity and strives for equal opportunity for everyone. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, characteristics, perspectives and skills. We encourage applicants of diverse gender, age, sexuality, religion, ethnicity, disability status and parental status to apply to our roles, or those from other intersecting minority groups not listed. The more diverse and inclusive we are as a team, the greater our work will be. If we can support you on DEI related questions during the interview process, please reach out to talentacquisition@traderepublic.com.

A technically adept (junior) Data Scientist is sought by the highly visible Data Science team of this leading global insights consultancy in a key role.




The Data Science Team here covers numerous segmentation and conjoint led insights projects, grounded in survey data, and working closely with consulting teams and clients in so doing – but they are also involved in wider corporate initiatives where data science input is required too.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.

Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is to maximise business impact within one of many business areas. You will help answer questions like:



Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?



The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Requirements



A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)
Experience conducting A/B experiments
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems

Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.

We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

Workplace & Benefits

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know.

Job Description

We have recently established a Data Science team at the centre of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT). The team's mission is to engage with every corner of the department to uncover opportunities where innovative and experimental data science techniques can enhance existing products, processes, and analysis or generate entirely novel insights. This spans across sectors from telecoms to quantum to AI, all while embracing the possibility of failure as a path to discovery. Through this, we will help set the strategic direction for a department that prioritises data, evidence, and real-time monitoring, and ensure that DSIT becomes data-confident. 

This role offers an unparalleled opportunity to shape and define your position within an established team, pitching project ideas and exploring novel collaborations. Your contribution will help further a team culture that fosters creativity and innovation in leveraging the latest developments in data science, such as generative AI and LLMs, to deliver transformative insights. You will be joining at a critical time, with the chance to influence how data science shapes the department's impact in a still-evolving landscape.  

We are looking for highly motivated individuals to join us as we refine our operating model to enhance DSIT's data science capability. Technical skills are necessary for the role, but we are equally interested in your ability to be a proactive, independent thinker, eager to contribute to a team culture of innovation and collaboration. Our work will touch on exciting policy areas and involve collaboration with analytical teams across the department (such as the Government Office for Science), arms-length bodies (e.g. UK Research and Innovation and the UK Space Agency), and executive agencies (e.g., Building Digital UK). This means we will have the opportunity to explore many fascinating projects, either independently as a team or in collaboration with the analytical teams embedded across the department. Innovation is enshrined in the name, delivery plan, and ethos of the department, so we will have every opportunity to explore new ideas, trial novel approaches, and have the freedom to carve our own path. 

We have a vision for the team to be highly collaborative and proactively inclusive, with the flexibility to respond quickly to urgent asks while building out longer-term data science projects and products. We have access to multiple data science platforms and sandbox areas, meaning you can access truly novel tools and be working on cutting-edge data science techniques. Additionally, learning and development is a core focus of the team, with an afternoon a week reserved as protected time specifically for self-directed learning and development. We celebrate and value this L&D, and actively cascade outputs between members of the team.

Person specification

Key Responsibilities

The work within the team is intended to be experimental and innovative. Because of this, the projects that you will get to work on will be varied. You will have the opportunity to use a range of data science techniques, and to propose new approaches that provide insight and improve data practices. The following gives an indication of the kind of work we are currently pursuing. 


Developing chatbots through the use of large language models to support the department’s ability to deal with large amounts of unstructured text data.  
Developing the department’s natural language processing capability to generate new datasets to track DSIT’s core interests.  
Developing web apps to ensure insights are being delivered to stakeholders in the most digestible format to enable data-led decision-making.  
Ensuring reliable pipelines to ingest data into the department and delivering it in a usable format to analytical teams.  
Building out the data science capability across the department – supporting analysts to add coding to their analytical toolkit, thinking about how we can embed data science across all areas of the business and supporting DSIT’s ambitions to be using data in the most innovative way in government.  
Deploying advanced analysis techniques, such as machine learning, to support policy development across the department, including exploring novel datasets.

The team's mission is to engage with every corner of the department to uncover opportunities where innovative and experimental data science techniques can enhance existing products, processes, and analysis or generate entirely novel insights. This spans across sectors from telecoms to quantum to AI, all while embracing the possibility of failure as a path to discovery. Through this, we will help set the strategic direction for a department that prioritises data, evidence, and real-time monitoring, and ensure that DSIT becomes data-confident. <br><br>This role offers an unparalleled opportunity to shape and define your position within an established team, pitching project ideas and exploring novel collaborations. Your contribution will help further a team culture that fosters creativity and innovation in leveraging the latest developments in data science, such as generative AI and LLMs, to deliver transformative insights. You will be joining at a critical time, with the chance to influence how data science shapes the department's impact in a still-evolving landscape.  <br><br>We are looking for highly motivated individuals to join us as we refine our operating model to enhance DSIT's data science capability. Technical skills are necessary for the role, but we are equally interested in your ability to be a proactive, independent thinker, eager to contribute to a team culture of innovation and collaboration. Our work will touch on exciting policy areas and involve collaboration with analytical teams across the department (such as the Government Office for Science), arms-length bodies (e.g. UK Research and Innovation and the UK Space Agency), and executive agencies (e.g., Building Digital UK). This means we will have the opportunity to explore many fascinating projects, either independently as a team or in collaboration with the analytical teams embedded across the department. Innovation is enshrined in the name, delivery plan, and ethos of the department, so we will have every opportunity to explore new ideas, trial novel approaches, and have the freedom to carve our own path. <br><br>We have a vision for the team to be highly collaborative and proactively inclusive, with the flexibility to respond quickly to urgent asks while building out longer-term data science projects and products. We have access to multiple data science platforms and sandbox areas, meaning you can access truly novel tools and be working on cutting-edge data science techniques. Additionally, learning and development is a core focus of the team, with an afternoon a week reserved as protected time specifically for self-directed learning and development. We celebrate and value this L&amp;D, and actively cascade outputs between members of the team.<br><br><strong>Person specification<br><br></strong><strong>Key Responsibilities<br><br></strong>The work within the team is intended to be experimental and innovative. Because of this, the projects that you will get to work on will be varied.

Who are we and why do we do what we do?

We are a data and payments company on a mission! We’re a group of developers, financial experts, and optimists who share a vision for improving the financial wellness of people, their businesses, and their communities.

We started this company with the aim of changing how the industry used and viewed data. As architects of Open Banking, Open Finance, and Open Data, we strive to be a force for good — changing the status quo of how businesses interact with people. We strive to serve the whole population through every change in their finances.

We do this by powering businesses through our APIs and Personal Finance Tech solutions as well as our own personal financial management app for consumers.

We can only do that by being an inclusive and diverse organisation. We invest in our people, and enjoy an environment focused on innovation, collaboration and openness.

What do we offer?

We champion flexibility, and we trust and respect our employees to deliver results in a way that best suits them, working around their own lives and commitments.

We live and breathe a fantastic culture of remote working and you may perform your duties predominantly from your home. However, the heart of Moneyhub is in Bristol and from time to time you will be required to attend company meet ups. Your role may require you to attend client meetings, networking events or group training sessions. You may also be required to work at such other place or places as we may reasonably require from time to time. As a minimum, you will be required to attend a quarterly All Team Away Day at a location of our choice (including overseas).

As well as a truly flexible approach, we also offer a fantastic range of benefits, including:

Remote working - with quarterly away days, regular team meeting and face to face client meetings as required.

10% contribution towards your Pension from your very first day with us;

25 days of holiday (plus bank hols), rising to 30 days after two years;

Choose to take your entitlement to UK bank holidays at other times based on your own days of significance;

Private medical insurance, including cover for pre-existing conditions, plus dental and optical benefit;

Six week Moneyhubber Family Pay when you become a new parent;

Permanent health insurance and life cover - much greater than the industry standard (death in service);

Employee assistance programme;

Professional development support, with dedicated allowance of time and money;

Life event leave;

Cycle to work scheme;

EV Salary sacrifice scheme;

£750 towards professional memberships

Remote working benefits, including work from almost anywhere, access to co-working spaces and support for your home office set-up

High spec laptop

The Data Science capability at Moneyhub generates value from a rich repository of data sources. Its function is critical to the day-to-day running of the business, and it also spearheads the development of novel ideas to exploit new commercial opportunities.

You Can Expect To Work On


The Machine Learning based transaction categorisation engine that underpins the budgeting capabilities of the app and affordability checking, e.g. for mortgages.
Data Science oriented product development: identifying improvements to existing algorithms, or the creation of new products using a quantitative approach. Examples: identifying regular payments from raw transaction data, geotagging banking transactions from their descriptions, reverse engineering credit card APRs.
Analysis of the characteristics of the user base, i.e. user segmentation, to support business decisions. For instance, what’s the current financial situation of the users of the app, what are their goals and how should the product be developed to aid the user in their journey?

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.

What you’ll do

As a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.

Responsibilities


Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


A Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2025, or equivalent work experience
Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts



Preferred Qualifications


One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$104,000 - C$156,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Most importantly, we seek people who are excited about crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.

You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

From designing our data models to implementing the subtle interaction behaviors that differentiate good software from great software. We work closely with UX Designers, Product Managers, and Data Scientists throughout the entire product process, from conception to post-launch reflection.

We are looking for a Software Engineer to join the Login & Signup (LNS) team in our Vancouver Office. The LNS team is responsible for handling the registration and authentication of Asana's users, with emphasis on secure login for enterprise accounts, such as single sign-on through Identity Providers (Okta, OneLogin, Google SSO, etc.) and multi-factor authentication. It is a full-stack team; tech stack includes TypeScript/React and some Scala.

In enterprise applications, user account management and login is a challenging, multi-faceted technical space encompassing software security, compliance to industry standards and legal regulations, large-scale IT administration needs, and quality of end-user experience. LNS' goal is to create and maintain a best-in-class registration and authentication system for Asana: we want it to be compliant with the most recent security standards and regulations, safe for enterprises to adopt, fully integrated with leading identity management frameworks, while offering the most delightful, smooth and seamless user experience.

You’ll advocate for engineering best practices and work cross-functionally to define and build powerful admin features while influencing the team's velocity. You'll mentor other engineers and advocate for code and component quality, reusability, and consistency; and you'll be at the forefront of a new wave of consumer-like experiences for the enterprise and enjoy the challenge of balancing speed of execution with quality and building a product that users love.

This role is based in Vancouver, with an office-centric hybrid schedule. The standard in-office days are Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Most Asanas have the option to work from home on Wednesdays. Working from home on Fridays depends on the type of work you do and the teams with which you partner. If you're interviewing for this role, your recruiter will share more about the in-office requirements.

What You’ll Achieve


Work in a high-performance, dynamic team with a strong focus on velocity and software quality and people's professional development
Contribute to building a complex SaaS application that is a market leader in its segment
Collaborate with Product Managers and customers to understand the needs of IT admins of large enterprises, and identify features to satisfy those needs
Partner with our Product Security team to stay updated about security threats, vulnerabilities, and cutting-edge countermeasures to protect SaaS applications
Learn about state-of-the-art technologies, including single-sign on methods and integration with Identity Providers such as Okta and Azure AD
Drive large, impactful projects, delivering features rolled out and used in large organizations


About You


Experience driving projects of medium complexity autonomously and reliably, planning tasks through milestones and workstreams, coordinating multiple engineers, and delivering successfully and on time
Interested in working in a highly technical space, learn about state of the art registration and authentication technologies, and software security
Passion for software architecture and software quality
Strong commitment to building the best UX to delight consumer and enterprise users
Continuous improvement mindset and a drive to enhance the architecture, the code, and team processes
Enthusiasm for mentoring and coaching teammates and stakeholders and contributing to team growth
Relevant experience in the tech stack (React, Typescript, Scala, SQL) as well as in UX design are nice-to-haves
Relevant industry experience in authorization and software security is a big plus; if you hold this experience, make sure to emphasize it in your application


At Asana, we're committed to building teams that include a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, as this is critical to helping us achieve our mission. If you're interested in this role and don't meet every listed requirement, we still encourage you to apply.

What We’ll Offer

Our comprehensive compensation package plays a big part in how we recognize you for the impact you have on our path to achieving our mission. We believe that compensation should be reflective of the value you create relative to the market value of your role. To ensure pay is fair and not impacted by biases, we're committed to looking at market value which is why we check ourselves and conduct a yearly pay equity audit.

For this role, the estimated base salary range is between $146,000 - $178,000 CAD. The actual base salary will vary based on various factors, including market and individual qualifications objectively assessed during the interview process. The listed range above is a guideline, and the base salary range for this role may be modified.

In addition to base salary, your compensation package may include additional components such as equity, sales incentive pay (for most sales roles), and benefits. If you're interviewing for this role, speak with your Talent Acquisition Partner to learn more about the total compensation and benefits for this role.

We strive to provide equitable and competitive benefits packages that support our employees worldwide and include:


Mental health, wellness & fitness benefits
Career coaching & support
