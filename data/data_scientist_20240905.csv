OfferFit replaces A/B testing with AI testing, powered by reinforcement learning AI. This allows lifecycle marketers to test & improve the performance of their campaigns much faster than before. Customers include leading brands like Brinks Home, Yelp, Engie, and MetLife, among many others.




Note for Applicants:




Data shows that men on average apply for a role if they meet 6/10 requirements while women often only do so if it’s 10/10. We work hard to be clear and specific about what our roles require, and we encourage you to apply even if you don’t check all the boxes! Applying gives you the opportunity to be considered and we look forward to reviewing your application!




Position Overview:




Do you enjoy working on data-intensive products and being involved in projects from an early stage? Come join our quickly growing Engineering team to help design, improve and scale OfferFit's self-learning (reinforcement learning) AI platform.




In particular, you will:




Use robust software engineering best practices to design, implement, and improve modular components in a cutting-edge ML product.
Work closely with customer-facing teams to understand, translate, and generalize particular use cases to generic platform components.
Apply your extensive knowledge of Python and its ecosystem to produce clean, readable, and extendible code, and coach others on the team in doing the same.
Collaborate with teams responsible for OfferFit’s product strategy and roadmap.
Support teams implementing OfferFit for customers to ensure their success.
Work closely with our Applied Science team (data scientists) to help productize and deploy attribution and reinforcement learning algorithm improvements
Improve our core data pipelines and reporting architecture.




Tech stack:




Data Science/Back End: Python (Pandas, Polars, Ibis, Spark), SQL, BigQuery, FastAPI
Web [Not required for this role]: JavaScript (Vue, Node.js), HTML, CSS
Architecture/DevOps: Kubernetes, Airflow, Terraform, GCP
We write well-tested, type-hinted, documented, modular code and use pre-commit hooks, CI/CD, and issue tracking for development.




Why is it great:




No toy datasets in notebooks — we’re implementing AI pipelines in production at scale!

Are you up for the challenge to scale AI applications to hundred thousands of users, balancing best engineering practices and continuous user feedback? Then the role of a Senior Machine Learning Engineer will definitely trigger your interest!

In The Pocket's mission is to create digital products that make people happy and businesses grow. We believe both aspects are crucial for successful digital products, and they will often drive one another. Generative AI, Machine Learning & Data technologies allow us to improve both: by improving the experience of existing products, by enabling new business models based on newly uncovered insights and by enabling a whole range of new digital products with new value streams.

What you’ll do:

You'll closely collaborate with ML Engineers, Product Managers, Architects, and Software Engineers to define, implement and improve use cases that are enabled through machine learning. You are responsible for the life-cycle of the AI solution. This includes designing, developing testing, improving deploying and scaling the model that is used. There will be a focus on MLOps and the ability to scale modern NLP applications both in amount of users and data. But you don't do this in a vacuum. Rather, you're part of a multidisciplinary team where every member is equally responsible for the product's success
You keep up with the latest Data, Machine Learning & Generative AI advances, with a particular focus on what might be applicable in our context. In particular, your enthusiasm for ""what is possible"" motivates you and we expect you to transfer that enthusiasm to your team members and even our clients
You actively participate in knowledge sharing both towards peers (lessons learned, new advances, process improvements,..) as well as other people in our organisation (e.g. sales, marketing, product, strategy...). And it doesn't have to stop there: we happily support any initiatives to share our findings with the world, through blogs, talks, podcasts or guest lectures
You clearly communicate and set expectations. What realistic results can be expected? What are the greatest risks/unknowns? Always be open and honest, and don't be afraid to ask for help







Who you are:

You hold a bachelor/master/PhD degree in Computer Science (or related), and a master in Data Science / AI / Statistics or Machine Learning - or you have a proven track record in a similar role
You have a profound knowledge of Python and at least one of the most important machine learning frameworks (Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch,...) and are able to work AI platforms like Huggingface, replicate and/or AI cloud services like Vertex AI Studio, AWS Sagemaker or Azure AI Studio
You have relevant experience in going beyond running local ML experiments, but bringing ML to production, including MLOps, Data versioning, & LLM Orchestration frameworks
You have a broad awareness of the possibilities and limitations of ML, and see how Data and ML can help us build even better products for our clients.
You have an affinity with product design and engineering top-notch digital products
You highly value the principles of clean code, continuous improvement and rapid prototyping. Experience with continuous delivery and/or devops practices is a plus
Any experience with the broader services from Google Cloud Platform, AWS or Azure is a plus
You excel in sharing your knowledge with others, you enjoy coaching team members and helping them to gain more insights in your field of expertise

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, 2 Hour Learning. Have you got what it takes?

Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.

At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.

Your Role in the Revolution:

In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.

This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.

Who We're Looking For:

We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

For more information on 2 Hour Learning, visit our website [https://2hourlearning.com/] and the Future of Education Instagram page [https://www.instagram.com/futureof_education/]. To see a school built around 2 Hour Learning, check out Alpha [https://alpha.school/].

What You Will Be Doing


Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.
Drive Technical Projects: Take ownership of the entire development process, from gathering requirements to launching and iterating on products. You’ll work closely with stakeholders to ensure that our solutions meet learner needs and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
Collaborate and Communicate: Partner with a global team of developers, designers, and educational experts. Your ability to communicate complex ideas simply and effectively will be key to your success.
Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.


What You Won’t Be Doing


Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.

To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.

This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do


Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events


Who you are


You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an experienced Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

Then we have a great opportunity for you as Building Application Engineer!

What will be your mission?

The Innovation Hub was inaugurated in March 2023. What it still lacks is visitor registration (preferably Planon), comfort sensors (CO2, VOC, temperature, humidity, ...) and 'people count' sensors that give us a real time insight into how the Innovation Hub is visited and what the impact is on the available space, air quality and facilities.

This insight is preferably presented on a large (touch) screen and an app. In this way, we show how an integrated workplace management system (IWMS, such as Planon) is used to support facilities management. The student can develop the project from A to Z according to interest in depth.

An example of a trajectory is: research smart workplace experience, feasibility study of sensors and software, working out a plan of approach and its realization. It goes without saying that the student will receive guidance depending on the phase in the track and the area of interest.

This will be discussed with the student in advance and a schedule will be drawn up.

Where? At Uccle

Duration? 3-6 months!

The internship is unpaid

You’ll Spend Your Time


Design, implement, and maintain machine learning models at the intersection of program analysis and language processing, such as automatic code generation, code understanding.
Develop and optimize production-grade pipelines to ensure scalability and efficiency.
Optimize existing machine learning models for performance and efficiency.
Lead cross-team collaborations to integrate machine learning solutions into our products and services.
This is a ""research engineer"" position – we expect that you own features end-to-end, from ideation at our regular small-hands hackathons, to production.


What You’ll Need


Fluency in programming languages, specifically C++ and Python.
ML-serving savviness: you saw something as Triton/TensorRT/ONNX/llama.cpp in action.
Demonstrated experience in creating and maintaining production-grade data-, training- and evaluation pipelines.
Expertise in model optimization and the ability to manage experimentation processes end-to-end.
Familiarity with build systems such as Bazel (or similar), CI/CD pipelines, ability to operate at high testing standards.


We’d Be Lucky If You Have Experience In


Ability to not stop at the demo-level: Jupyter notebook, or even a locally running Python script is not your final goal.
Familiarity with ML training, evaluation, and experiment tracking frameworks.
Additional backend-heavy languages such as Go, Rust.
Experience with production/serving stack, such as Docker, k8s.
Research activities, publications in the field of ML, contributions to open-source projects.

OfferFit replaces A/B testing with AI testing, powered by reinforcement learning AI. This allows lifecycle marketers to test & improve the performance of their campaigns much faster than before. Customers include leading brands like Brinks Home, Yelp, Engie, and MetLife, among many others.

Note for Applicants:

Data shows that men on average apply for a role if they meet 6/10 requirements while women often only do so if it's 10/10. We work hard to be clear and specific about what our roles require, and we encourage you to apply even if you don't check all the boxes! Applying gives you the opportunity to be considered and we look forward to reviewing your application!

Position Overview:

Do you enjoy working on data-intensive products and being involved in projects from an early stage? Come join our quickly growing Engineering team to help design, improve and scale OfferFit's self-learning (reinforcement learning) AI platform.

In particular, you will:


Use robust software engineering best practices to design, implement, and improve modular components in a cutting-edge ML product.
Work closely with customer-facing teams to understand, translate, and generalize particular use cases to generic platform components.
Apply your extensive knowledge of Python and its ecosystem to produce clean, readable, and extendible code, and coach others on the team in doing the same.
Collaborate with teams responsible for OfferFit's product strategy and roadmap.
Support teams implementing OfferFit for customers to ensure their success.
Work closely with our Applied Science team (data scientists) to help productize and deploy attribution and reinforcement learning algorithm improvements
Improve our core data pipelines and reporting architecture.


Tech stack:


Data Science/Back End: Python (Pandas, Polars, Ibis, Spark), SQL, BigQuery, FastAPI
Web [Not required for this role]: JavaScript (Vue, Node.js), HTML, CSS
Architecture/DevOps: Kubernetes, Airflow, Terraform, GCP
We write well-tested, type-hinted, documented, modular code and use pre-commit hooks, CI/CD, and issue tracking for development.


Why is it great:

No toy datasets in notebooks — we're implementing AI pipelines in production at scale!


Learn tons about data architecture, data science, and self-learning AI.
Work in a team that not only talks the talk of development best practices, but walks the walk — unit & integration tests, modular design, CI/CD, pair programming, code reviews — the works.
Join OfferFit's fast-paced, supportive, and professional team. We make sure all of our team members are empowered and receive great mentorship and coaching.


Who's a Fit:


Exceptional coder: you write clean, object-oriented code; you care about good design and terse, testable APIs.
Tinkerer: you regularly explore and learn new technologies and methods, especially in the data architecture and data science domains.
Entrepreneurial: you proactively identify opportunities and risks, work around obstacles, and always seek creative ways to improve processes and outcomes.
Structured and organized: you can structure a plan, align stakeholders, and see it through to execution.
Clear communicator: you are able to express yourself clearly and persuasively, both in writing and speech.
Background in Machine Learning Engineering and/or Data Engineering is preferred. Some Data Science experience is nice-to-have but is not required.


Ideal Skills and Experience:


2+ years of experience working with Python in a production setting, including 1+ years in the data / machine learning ecosystem
Experience working with at least one major cloud platform (GCP, AWS, Azure, etc.)
Experience putting ML models into production
General understanding of supervised learning principles is a plus but not required


OfferFit Benefits and Perks:


Generous PTO (starting at 25 days PTO per year) and Parental leave policy (12 weeks paid)
100% remote work environment with flexible hours
Quarterly gatherings where we meet in person in a different city to work together, bond as a team and celebrate our progress
Weekly team events (lunch and learns, trivia, virtual escape rooms, town hall and team health ""barometer"" meetings)
Ability to learn and develop from an experienced leadership team (ex-Amazon, McKinsey, BCG, and IBM, among others) who are focused on building a talented, diverse, and inclusive team
Dedication to building a strong culture (e.g., team resource groups, weekly recognitions, major life event celebrations, mental health/sustainability days off, etc.)


Additional Requirements:


Fluency in English is required for this position
Ability to partially overlap with US time zones required


Please note that we adjust compensation for non–US countries using a relative cost of labor adjustment between the US and your country of residence. Applicants should apply via OfferFit's internal or external careers site.

OfferFit is committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace. OfferFit is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, protected veteran status, disability, age, or other legally protected status.

Estamos em busca de você que quer impactar e evoluir o mercado, e está disposto a passar pelos desafios que nosso ambiente propõe todos os dias. Nosso propósito é tornar as decisões sobre gente nas empresas mais justas, alcançando os melhores resultados para o RH.


Que Valorizamos No Nosso Time


Profundidade - Foco em resolver o problema da melhor maneira possível, estamos sempre colocando nossos conhecimentos em prática transformando em valor.

Generalismo - Gostamos de pessoas pitaqueiras que conhecem um pouco de tudo e não tem medo de dar a sua opinião com o objetivo de resolver os desafios da melhor maneira possível.

Franqueza - Somos diretos e francos, não gostamos de politicagem nem que as pessoas façam as coisas para mostrar, o nosso foco é em evoluir os produtos e inovar, não em impressionar pessoas influentes.﻿

Talentos são o nosso core - Somos uma empresa focada em pessoas, não em processos. Não somos apegados a burocracia, acreditamos no potencial do nosso time e a autonomia vem junto com muita responsabilidade. Confiamos uns nos outros e na qualidade das entregas, não perdemos tempo micro gerenciando o time.

Evolução constante - Estamos em um movimento constante de autoavaliação e foco em resolver problemas, buscando melhorar sempre. Caso precisarmos, vamos ser rápidos em mudanças para chegar no melhor resultado possível!


Que Esperar Da Mindsight


Impulsionamos Seu Desenvolvimento - Somos um ambiente de desafios, onde não deixamos nossos aprendizados apenas na teoria, e sim colocamos tudo em prática. Queremos que você continue aprendendo constantemente, por isso oferecemos um auxílio educação para livros, cursos, eventos, entre outros, te ajudando a causar impacto em todos os momentos da sua jornada.

Todos Temos Autonomia - Nossa estrutura é horizontal, onde você é dono das suas das suas entregas, porém como dizia o Tio Ben ""Com grandes poderes vêm grandes responsabilidades"", contamos com você para que possa tocar projetos de impacto com independência e compromisso. Então se você tem iniciativa e não tem medo de errar. Somos a empresa perfeita para você!

Trabalhe Com Flexibilidade - Se prepare para uma empresa sem muita burocracia e com MUITA flexibilidade. Quem decide seus horários é você! Porém com tanta autonomia, ainda precisa haver organização, responsabilidade e entregas. Independente de modelo de trabalho remoto ou híbrido, apoiamos os dois. Nosso escritório de apoio está localizado em São Paulo.

Seja Você Mesmo - Aqui não temos espaço para julgamentos, pois não queremos impressionar ninguém. Confiamos no trabalho de todos sem se importar com aparência, vestimentas, cargos, status e qualquer outra coisa que não define seu potencial.

Somos Francos Uns Com Os Outros - Prezamos por transparência e estamos sempre abertos a feedbacks. É importante opinar na hora certa, e ouvir críticas relevantes. Porém algumas coisas não são tão fáceis de dizer, tenha o apoio e proteção da nossa Ouvidoria.

Estamos à procura de um Desenvolvedor Full Stack Junior para se juntar à nossa equipe e nos ajudar a enfrentar os desafios tecnológicos da Mindsight. Estamos crescendo de forma constante nos últimos anos, desenvolvendo produtos que utilizam dados e metodologias científicas para aprimorar o RH, sempre com uma abordagem baseada em evidências, sem achismos.

Sua Missão: Você será parte central na criação dos nossos produtos, responsável por construir novos sistemas, atualizar os sistemas existentes e implementar novos módulos e funcionalidades. Seu trabalho envolverá interagir com especialistas e designers para entender as soluções propostas, discutir sua aplicabilidade como software e participar ativamente no desenvolvimento de melhorias.

Você terá a oportunidade de programar funcionalidades, realizar testes, consertar bugs, revisar código junto ao time e participar do lançamento de novas versões do sistema.

Uma história de mais de 60 anos de solidez e inovação.

Em 1961 foi fundado o Banco Sofisa, em uma jornada de transformação, adaptação e principalmente inovação.

Hoje, temos orgulho em ser um dos principais bancos do Brasil. O motivo disso é incentivar e acreditar no empreendedor brasileiro, fortalecendo relacionamentos apoiados na ética e no respeito. Um dos fatores que nos destacam no mercado é o comprometimento dos nossos colaboradores, com forte espírito empreendedor e uma paixão que os fazem vestir a camisa como se fossem donos. É essa mesma motivação que nos leva a prêmios e conquistas notáveis, como o de Melhor Banco do Brasil, em um ranking realizado pela Forbes, no ano de 2023.

Por aqui, não nos contentamos com o status quo. Acreditamos que sempre podemos melhorar, aprender, investir e buscar o novo. A melhora contínua é um processo diário. Em 2011, inauguramos uma nova categoria de serviços bancários no Brasil, lançando o primeiro banco digital de investimentos: o Sofisa Direto. Com isso, encontramos a oportunidade ideal para manter os nossos clientes motivados a buscar os seus objetivos. Em toda a história, os negócios do Banco Sofisa foram construídos por uma sólida estrutura financeira, assegurada por altos índices de capitalização, fazendo com que os nossos clientes sintam-se seguros, investindo em ativos de qualidade, que muitas das vezes só se encontram por aqui.

Hoje, podemos dizer que vencemos o maior de todos os testes, o teste do tempo. E se esse teste foi vencido, é porque valorizamos quem realmente importa: você, nosso cliente. Cada obstáculo superado, cada desafio vencido são os fundamentos da solidez e a experiência que precisamos para seguir em frente.

Somos o Banco Sofisa. Somos diferentes!

Uma história de mais de 60 anos de solidez e inovação.

Em 1961 foi fundado o Banco Sofisa, em uma jornada de transformação, adaptação e principalmente inovação.

Hoje, temos orgulho em ser um dos principais bancos do Brasil. O motivo disso é incentivar e acreditar no empreendedor brasileiro, fortalecendo relacionamentos apoiados na ética e no respeito. Um dos fatores que nos destacam no mercado é o comprometimento dos nossos colaboradores, com forte espírito empreendedor e uma paixão que os fazem vestir a camisa como se fossem donos. É essa mesma motivação que nos leva a prêmios e conquistas notáveis, como o de Melhor Banco do Brasil, em um ranking realizado pela Forbes, no ano de 2023.

Por aqui, não nos contentamos com o status quo. Acreditamos que sempre podemos melhorar, aprender, investir e buscar o novo. A melhora contínua é um processo diário. Em 2011, inauguramos uma nova categoria de serviços bancários no Brasil, lançando o primeiro banco digital de investimentos: o Sofisa Direto. Com isso, encontramos a oportunidade ideal para manter os nossos clientes motivados a buscar os seus objetivos. Em toda a história, os negócios do Banco Sofisa foram construídos por uma sólida estrutura financeira, assegurada por altos índices de capitalização, fazendo com que os nossos clientes sintam-se seguros, investindo em ativos de qualidade, que muitas das vezes só se encontram por aqui.

Hoje, podemos dizer que vencemos o maior de todos os testes, o teste do tempo. E se esse teste foi vencido, é porque valorizamos quem realmente importa: você, nosso cliente. Cada obstáculo superado, cada desafio vencido são os fundamentos da solidez e a experiência que precisamos para seguir em frente.

Somos o Banco Sofisa. Somos diferentes!

DATA SCIENTIST – GENERATIVE AI SPECIALIST

Entra nel nostro mondo.

Trasforma insieme a noi.

Quale sarà la tua sfida?

Bip ha creato all’interno del proprio Competence Centre “xTech” il più nutrito gruppo di Data Scientist in Italia (fonte: statistiche LinkedIn), e dall’Italia coordina anche i propri gruppi di Data Scientist locali presso le proprie sedi estere.

Nell’ambito della continua crescita ed evoluzione di questo effervescente gruppo, che opera sui nostri clienti in tutti i settori, e ci ha consentito di introdurre l’Intelligenza Artificiale presso le realtà enterprise più importanti d’Italia, siamo alla ricerca sia di profili junior/intermediate (dai neolaureati a profili con almeno 2 anni di esperienza), sia profili middle-senior (dai 3 ai 6 anni di esperienza). La provenienza da società di consulenza direzionale o informatica sarà considerata un forte plus.

I/Le nostri/e Generative AI Specialists verranno introdotti in contesti progettuali dove per la maggior parte i dati sono non strutturati (testi, immagini, video, suoni) e il cui focus diventa la comprensione, il processamento e la generazione partendo da tali basi documentali altrimenti non processabili con le classiche tecniche di Data Science.

I contesti progettuali spaziano dall’utilizzo di modelli pre-addestrati (es. LLM) fino all’addestramento di nuovi modelli di Generative AI passando dal fine-tuning e absorption learning da modelli commerciali.

Oltre alle progettualità, ai/alle Generative AI Specialist sarà richiesto un contributo attivo per alimentare la Community con attività di ricerca, scouting, concept di nuove soluzioni e business development.

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, 2 Hour Learning. Have you got what it takes?

Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.

At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.

We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.

Who We're Looking For:

We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.


What You Won’t Be Doing


Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.

DATA SCIENTIST – GENERATIVE AI SPECIALIST

Entra nel nostro mondo.

Trasforma insieme a noi.

Quale sarà la tua sfida?

Bip ha creato all’interno del proprio Competence Centre “xTech” il più nutrito gruppo di Data Scientist in Italia (fonte: statistiche LinkedIn), e dall’Italia coordina anche i propri gruppi di Data Scientist locali presso le proprie sedi estere.

Nell’ambito della continua crescita ed evoluzione di questo effervescente gruppo, che opera sui nostri clienti in tutti i settori, e ci ha consentito di introdurre l’Intelligenza Artificiale presso le realtà enterprise più importanti d’Italia, siamo alla ricerca sia di profili junior/intermediate (dai neolaureati a profili con almeno 2 anni di esperienza), sia profili middle-senior (dai 3 ai 6 anni di esperienza). La provenienza da società di consulenza direzionale o informatica sarà considerata un forte plus.

Il/La Generative AI Specialist in Bip evolve non solo le proprie competenze nei modelli di Generative AI, ma anche la comprensione dei fenomeni legati al Business dei nostri Clienti e le proprie capacità di tradurli in soluzioni e poi di comunicare e utilizzare i risultati degli stessi per migliorare ed efficientare i processi.

I/Le nostri/e Generative AI Specialists verranno introdotti in contesti progettuali dove per la maggior parte i dati sono non strutturati (testi, immagini, video, suoni) e il cui focus diventa la comprensione, il processamento e la generazione partendo da tali basi documentali altrimenti non processabili con le classiche tecniche di Data Science.

I contesti progettuali spaziano dall’utilizzo di modelli pre-addestrati (es. LLM) fino all’addestramento di nuovi modelli di Generative AI passando dal fine-tuning e absorption learning da modelli commerciali.

Oltre alle progettualità, ai/alle Generative AI Specialist sarà richiesto un contributo attivo per alimentare la Community con attività di ricerca, scouting, concept di nuove soluzioni e business development.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.




To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.




For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.




We're seeking exceptional engineers interested in working in backend, data, infrastructure, mobile, or security & privacy. Don’t worry if you are not sure about what area would suit you best: We’ll have time to determine what’s likely to be the ideal fit for you.




No matter your seniority, you will work on production code, directly improving our products or adding new exceptional features. At the moment, most teams use Python, Typescript, or Java for the backend, and Kotlin and Swift for mobile. Our approach to software development is highly flexible, and we adapt our tech stack to the needs of the different products.




A few examples of your responsibilities

Work closely with other software engineers to expand our set of libraries and make our processes ever-more efficient.
Learn about the latest and greatest technologies, testing the promising ones to make sure we don’t miss out on game-changing opportunities to boost our productivity and the enjoyment of our work.
Constantly improve the quality of our products, tools, or infrastructures by fixing bugs and refactoring the code base where necessary.




What we look for

Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.




What we offer

Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of €63,965. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between €105,737 and €143,330. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.




Commitment & contract

Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time.




Location

Milan (Italy) or fully remote.




Before you apply

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We’re extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don’t hesitate to apply.




The selection process

          <p>At Bending Spoons, we’re striving to build one of the all-time great companies. A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.</p><p><br></p><p>To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.</p><p><br></p><p>For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.</p><p><br></p><p>We're seeking exceptional engineers interested in working in backend, data, infrastructure, mobile, or security &amp; privacy. Don’t worry if you are not sure about what area would suit you best: We’ll have time to determine what’s likely to be the ideal fit for you.</p><p><br></p><p>No matter your seniority, you will work on production code, directly improving our products or adding new exceptional features. At the moment, most teams use Python, Typescript, or Java for the backend, and Kotlin and Swift for mobile. Our approach to software development is highly flexible, and we adapt our tech stack to the needs of the different products.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A few examples of your responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Work closely with other software engineers to expand our set of libraries and make our processes ever-more efficient.</li><li>Learn about the latest and greatest technologies, testing the promising ones to make sure we don’t miss out on game-changing opportunities to boost our productivity and the enjoyment of our work.</li><li>Constantly improve the quality of our products, tools, or infrastructures by fixing bugs and refactoring the code base where necessary.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><u>What we look for</u></p><ul><li><strong>Reasoning ability.</strong> Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.</li><li><strong>Drive.</strong> You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.</li><li><strong>Team spirit.</strong> You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.</li><li><strong>Proficiency in English.</strong> You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><u>What we offer</u></p><ul><li><strong>Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams.</strong> You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.</li><li><strong>An exceptional opportunity for growth.</strong> We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.</li><li><strong>Competitive pay and access to equity in the company.</strong> Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of €63,965. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between €105,737 and €143,330. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.</li><li><strong>All. These. Benefits.</strong> Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Commitment &amp; contract</strong></p><p>Permanent or fixed-term.
