About Phaidra

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, and India.

That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe’s mission is to build the economic infrastructure for the internet. Risk Engineering brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s financial and regulatory risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. We build ML and backend systems to catch fraudsters, understand users’ cash flow and financial health, and ensure Stripe’s users are compliant with regulatory and financial partner requirements. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from financial losses that can put Stripe’s business at risk.

The Risk group consists of machine learning, backend, and full stack engineers who tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We are undertaking several new efforts, where you can have an outsized impact on the architecture, implementation, and design choices behind these systems.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Most importantly, we seek people who are excited about crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.


Data Science is an integral component of Coinbase’s product and decision making process: we work in partnership with Product, Engineering and Design to influence the roadmap and better understand our users. With a deep expertise in experimentation, analytics and advanced modeling, we produce insights which directly move the company’s bottom line.

What You'll Be Doing


Perform analyses on products to answer open-ended questions and provide strategic recommendations.
Design and guide experiments/analysis to measure impact and drive product improvements.
Develop and maintain key metrics and reports, enhancing data infrastructure for better analysis.


What We Look For In You


At least a BA/BS in a quantitative field (ex Math, Stats, Physics, or Computer Science) with ≥2+ years of relevant experience.
Experience driving impact for a digital product with an iterative development cycle.
Understanding of statistical concepts and practical experience applying them (in A|B testing, causal inference, ML, etc.).
Experience in data analyses using SQL.
Experience in programming/modeling in Python.
Demonstration of our core cultural values: clear communication, positive energy, continuous learning, and efficient execution.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Most importantly, we seek people who are excited about crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.


Data Science is an integral component of Coinbase’s product and decision making process: we work in partnership with Product, Engineering and Design to influence the roadmap and better understand our users. With a deep expertise in experimentation, analytics and advanced modeling, we produce insights which directly move the company’s bottom line.

What You'll Be Doing


Perform analyses on products to answer open-ended questions and provide strategic recommendations.
Design and guide experiments/analysis to measure impact and drive product improvements.
Develop and maintain key metrics and reports, enhancing data infrastructure for better analysis.


What We Look For In You


At least a BA/BS in a quantitative field (ex Math, Stats, Physics, or Computer Science) with ≥2+ years of relevant experience.
Experience driving impact for a digital product with an iterative development cycle.
Understanding of statistical concepts and practical experience applying them (in A|B testing, causal inference, ML, etc.).
Experience in data analyses using SQL.
Experience in programming/modeling in Python.
Demonstration of our core cultural values: clear communication, positive energy, continuous learning, and efficient execution.

Poly is building a better file storage platform for everyone. We've raised $8M from YC, Bloomberg Beta, Felicis, Figma Ventures, AI Grant, and more, and we're looking to grow our founding team of superstar builders and dreamers.

Poly’s intelligent file system is a desktop and web application that lets you store and browse your files with the help of a powerful multimodal AI. An easy way to wrap your head around it is to check out a demo from Abhay

We are adamant that Poly is the future way to store files for everyone because:


Our product is intelligent -- all your files are indexed and searchable with a home-grown LLM that can find and even sort and organize your files, search by image and many other file types, and soon ask questions about your files and watch as an AI system references your own files to give an answer.
Our product is lightweight -- we don't install a sync service that's constantly scanning your hard drive and we never need to resolve sync conflicts, ever.
Completely, 100% cross-platform -- Our product looks identical across web and desktop, with zero compromises in the UI/UX, and all your files always available and up-to-date.
Our product improves every 2 days, not every 2 years -- Finder and File Explorer haven't changed in years or decades because they're linked to OS upgrade cycles. Our product ships updates every day and can add all kinds of features, fixes, and file type support at light speed.
Many, many more reasons -- deep folder searching, beautiful view modes, extensible metadata, ergonomics, public sharing, and so much more.


About You

We are looking to grow from two founding teammates (we've accomplished a lot as just one engineer and one designer!) to a clan of around eight, so you'll be anywhere from engineer #2 to #7. You'll be tasked with bringing Poly to life as breakthrough AI service with leading performance on relevant benchmarks, generating novel insights along the way to make Poly the “search engine for your life”.

Specifically, in a AI research engineer role, we are looking for the following concrete skills and prior experience


High baseline knowledge of core statistical modeling principles, including the ability to write down or describe core ML modeling equations such as gradient descent, scaled dot product attention, cross-entropy, and so forth.
Extensive experience with modeling / inference tools such as pytorch and CUDA.
Pragmatic and product focused mindset, with the passion to see any developments make it into customer hands as quickly as possible.
Familiarity with modern LLM-based development fundamentals including prompting, function calling, and agentic workflows.
Knowledge of Python is a must, and enthusiasm for Rust is highly encouraged.
An extreme appetite for learning that you've honed through recursive self-improvement. You should be able to demonstrate an exceptional aptitude for automating your own development processes.
You thrive in independent, inter-disciplinary environments, and you are skilled at collaborating across domains and for productively engaging with people of all kinds.
You are willing to leave judgments about gender, race, creed, background, belief, or politics for outside of the workplace so that we can focus on building the world's best file storage platform for everyone.
You are capable of (and excited to) work in-person 5-days a week in SoMa, San Francisco

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Most importantly, we seek people who are excited about crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.


Data Science is an integral component of Coinbase’s product and decision making process: we work in partnership with Product, Engineering and Design to influence the roadmap and better understand our users.

UnitedMasters is building a marketplace that connects artists, brands and fans - empowering artists to earn and grow. UnitedMasters has taken the bold step of building a music distribution service that, radically, puts artists first - disrupting the legacy music business by letting up-and-coming artists distribute their music directly to fans through streaming services while maintaining ownership of their master recording rights and up to 100% of royalties. Through the combination of UnitedMasters’ music distribution platform and its deep ties to brands, UnitedMasters enables independent artists and change-makers to grow and earn unlike any other platform.

The UnitedMasters team is made up of musicians, marketers, engineers, and storytellers with backgrounds from YouTube, SoundCloud, Pandora, Facebook, Uber, Dropbox, Complex, VICE, and more. We work hand in hand with the award-winning creative teams that forge those innovative partnerships at Translation (our in-house creative advertising agency).

We are looking for a Senior Data Scientist to join UnitedMasters! Please note that this is a Hybrid role: two days in office and three days remote.

What You'll Do

As a Senior Data Scientist, you’ll develop analytic capabilities that fuel artist success. You’ll partner with the Music, Product and Engineering teams to infuse UnitedMasters’ products and processes with signals that help us sign artist talent, drive more meaningful product engagement and deliver artist outcomes. You will:


Solve for the unknown. You’ll translate Music and Product challenges into analytic objectives, then develop and execute on a technical plan to solve for strategic opportunities and sticky business problems.
Make your partners superheroes. You’ll collaborate with cross-functional teams and empower partners and customers with data assets and analytic insights that shape the artist, brand and fan marketplace.
Drive product innovation. You’ll infuse the UnitedMasters product with responsive, algorithmic insights that highlight systemic opportunities for artists to expand their influence and put themselves on the path to success.
Evangelize robust measurement. You will develop robust measurement strategies across experimentation, modeling, and analytics, including owning the process of gathering, extracting and compiling data sources across relevant tools like SQL, DBT and Python.

Salary Hiring Range: $195,000 - $230,000

Our salary ranges are based on paying competitively for our size and industry, and are one part of many compensation, benefits and other reward opportunities we provide (e.g. bonus, stock options, 401(k) match, etc.)

Individual pay rate decisions are based on a number of factors, including qualifications for the role, experience level, skillset, and balancing internal equity relative to peers at the company. We expect the majority of the candidates who are offered roles at our company to fall healthily throughout the range based on these factors.

The range above is for the expectations as laid out in the job description, however we are often open to a wide variety of profiles, and recognize that the person we hire may be less experienced (or more senior) than this job description as posted. If that ends up being the case, the updated salary range will be communicated with you as a candidate.

The salary range above is for the NY/CA. As a company, we have a location based strategy, which means the salary range could be lower or higher than this if the role is hired in another location.

Backed by $9M in funding from top VCs like NEA and General Catalyst, Martian is a Deeptech AI research lab. The team consists of multiple professors, serial entrepreneurs, and AI researchers from Stanford, Harvard, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Research who have previously build and sold multiple NLP companies.




Martian's Model Router:

Martian is doing for LLMs what Google did for websites. In the early internet, the number of websites was exploding and it was hard to figure out what website you should use for what task. Google fixed that problem by building a search engine that aggregated websites across the internet. A similar problem exists in AI today; the number of models is exploding and it's hard to figure out what model you should use for what task. Martian fixes that problem through a model router: You give us your prompt, we run it on the best model in real time.
We can do this because we've learned how to predict the performance of a model without running it. That lets us find a model which can complete your request with the highest performance and lowest cost. The value proposition is simple: stop worrying about AI, start focusing on product.
That idea -- making it so that people can stop worrying about AI -- is the core of what we do. Model-routing is just the first tool we're building to help understand the way in which models behave. By pioneering techniques like this, we want to solve the most fundamental problem in AI: understanding why models behave the way they do, and creating guarantees they'll behave the way we want.




About the role:

Building a good model-router is technically challenging. It requires understanding and measuring model performance (both through qualitative metrics and human preferences), developing more effective routing systems (better data, new model architectures, query-rewriting, and fundamental research into how models work), and productionizing the tools we build (reducing latency, improving model costs, ML Ops).




In this role you will:

Work alongside the founders to develop model-routing technology and bring it into production.
Introduce new techniques, tools, and architectures that improve the performance, latency, throughput, and efficiency of our deployed models.
Set up the core infrastructure and best-practices for things like model hosting and training
Help build out the ML Eng & Research teams




You'll thrive in this role if you:

Have an understanding of modern ML architectures and an intuition for how to optimize their performance, particularly for inference.
Have deployed deep learning models, and especially LLMs, in production
Have a good understanding of the literature on model evaluation and have trained reward models from human or AI feedback or worked on LLM-as-judges.
Own problems end-to-end, and are willing to pick up whatever knowledge you're missing to get the job done.
Have at least 7 years of professional software engineering experience (particularly in an ML Engineering role) or equivalent.
Are self-directed and enjoy figuring out the most important problem to work on.
Have a good intuition for when off-the-shelf solutions will work, and build tools to accelerate your own workflow quickly if they won’t.




What We Offer:

Competitive salary and equity packages
Health, dental, and vision insurance plans
Unlimited PTO
Daily lunch
Team dinners




Location:

In-person in San Francisco preferred (open to remote)

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

At Warner Music Group, we’re a global collective of music makers and music lovers, tech innovators and inspired entrepreneurs, game-changing creatives and passionate team members. Here, we know that each talent makes our collective bolder and brighter. We are guided by four core principles that underpin everything we do across all our diverse businesses:


Music is Everything: Music is our passion, and we can never get enough. Tastes, trends, and tech will change, but great artists and songwriters will always be our driving force.
Global Growth, Local Expertise: Music is a global language. Through communication and collaboration, our success can come from anywhere and translate everywhere.
Innovation and Insight: Pushing the boundaries requires the best information and the boldest imagination. We use both to create the future.
Empowered by People: Like the artists we serve and the music they make, our differences make us stronger. This is a place where every talent can belong and build a career.


We remain committed to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We know it fosters a culture where you can truly belong, contribute, and grow. We encourage applications from people of any age, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion, ethnicity, disability, veteran status, and any other characteristic or identity.

Consider a career at WMG and get the best of both worlds – an innovative global music company that retains the creative spirit of a nimble independent.

A little bit about our team:

WMG’s Business Intelligence team (BI) works to influence WMG’s strategy and day-to-day operations by developing thoughtful insights & intelligence from its core business practices. The BI team works with various departments across Warner Music’s Central Functions, Recorded Music, & Music Publishing Divisions to understand the trends and dynamics that drive the constant evolution of our business. Our goal for this role is to strengthen our analytical power and bring improved rigor to the insights we deliver to our family of labels and operators. We work with partners across the company to establish best practices for breaking artists and sustaining catalog repertoire across consumption platforms, gauge the impact of marketing initiatives and campaigns, and work to understand user behavior around the world.

Your role:

Intelligence is the lifeblood of today’s music business, and in this role you’ll get a chance to apply your creativity and problem-solving skills to help our labels and artists connect with consumers across an array of media and mediums. Because the BI team works closely with departments across the company, you will have the opportunity to see the inner workings and decision-making within a global music company - and the ability to influence those decisions with thoughtful intelligence work. We’re a collaborative team that loves learning new things, sharing ideas, thinking about the future of the music industry – and helping our company get there.

Here you’ll get to:


Lead data science projects from inception to completion on topics such as consumption and revenue forecasts, digital advertising forecasts, global trends analysis, business performance trends, and more.
Apply advanced data analysis and statistical modeling techniques to address complex business challenges. Develop and maintain production-level models, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
Work closely with Business Intelligence, Strategy, Corporate Finance, and operators to understand business needs, and provide actionable insights to a diverse audience across the business.
Proactively identify areas where data science can add value by experimenting with different hypotheses and techniques to improve existing processes and techniques within the BI team.
Utilize advanced tools and frameworks for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
Promote and participate in a culture of continuous learning within the team by providing feedback, sharing knowledge, and mentoring more junior team members.


About you:


Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Data Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, or a related field.
1-3 years of full-time post-graduation experience in the music, entertainment, sports, or financial services industry. Candidates with a PhD can be considered for this level.
Experience and comfort in working with data from globally-trusted third-party sources like the UN, IMF, OECD, and World Bank.
Demonstrated ability to lead and execute data science projects with minimal supervision.
Proficiency in programming languages such as Python or R for data analysis and model development.
Experience with machine learning frameworks and statistical tools.
Strong understanding of SQL and working with large datasets.
Familiarity with data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI.
Expertise in fundamental data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling techniques.
Ability to quickly learn and adapt to new techniques and technologies.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to explain complex concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
Strong problem-solving abilities, with a bias towards action and a proactive approach to identifying opportunities and challenges.


We’d love it if you also had:


Familiarity with the streaming music landscape or other digital media
Experience building analytical products and dashboards within BI software like Tableau or other environments like Streamlit.

At Warner Music Group, we’re a global collective of music makers and music lovers, tech innovators and inspired entrepreneurs, game-changing creatives and passionate team members. Here, we know that each talent makes our collective bolder and brighter. We are guided by four core principles that underpin everything we do across all our diverse businesses:


Music is Everything: Music is our passion, and we can never get enough. Tastes, trends, and tech will change, but great artists and songwriters will always be our driving force.
Global Growth, Local Expertise: Music is a global language. Through communication and collaboration, our success can come from anywhere and translate everywhere.
Innovation and Insight: Pushing the boundaries requires the best information and the boldest imagination. We use both to create the future.
Empowered by People: Like the artists we serve and the music they make, our differences make us stronger. This is a place where every talent can belong and build a career.


We remain committed to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We know it fosters a culture where you can truly belong, contribute, and grow. We encourage applications from people of any age, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion, ethnicity, disability, veteran status, and any other characteristic or identity.

Consider a career at WMG and get the best of both worlds – an innovative global music company that retains the creative spirit of a nimble independent.

A little bit about our team:

WMG’s Business Intelligence team (BI) works to influence WMG’s strategy and day-to-day operations by developing thoughtful insights & intelligence from its core business practices. The BI team works with various departments across Warner Music’s Central Functions, Recorded Music, & Music Publishing Divisions to understand the trends and dynamics that drive the constant evolution of our business. Our goal for this role is to strengthen our analytical power and bring improved rigor to the insights we deliver to our family of labels and operators. We work with partners across the company to establish best practices for breaking artists and sustaining catalog repertoire across consumption platforms, gauge the impact of marketing initiatives and campaigns, and work to understand user behavior around the world.

Your role:

Intelligence is the lifeblood of today’s music business, and in this role you’ll get a chance to apply your creativity and problem-solving skills to help our labels and artists connect with consumers across an array of media and mediums. Because the BI team works closely with departments across the company, you will have the opportunity to see the inner workings and decision-making within a global music company - and the ability to influence those decisions with thoughtful intelligence work. We’re a collaborative team that loves learning new things, sharing ideas, thinking about the future of the music industry – and helping our company get there.

Here you’ll get to:

Our platform replicates the human immune system in a dish across populations to discover cures at a pace never seen before. Come join us on our mission to flip the 95% drug failure rate to a 95% success rate.

What we do:

Our immune systems are master regulators of health and disease. Current tools used to discover drugs that target the immune system are wildly inadequate. To fix this critical gap, Parallel Bio created a human 'immune system in a dish' to rapidly accelerate the development of new drugs and immunotherapies more likely to work in patients. This is the first step on our journey to build a new type of biopharma by reimagining the way we cure disease. Our mission is to design and engineer breakthrough tools inspired by human biology, starting with replacing ineffectual mouse and synthetic platforms.

Who you are:

You are someone excited about what we are doing at Parallel Bio and have a scientific background. Please submit your information here if you have a background in the following:


Have held a position like junior scientist, principal scientist, data scientist, Head of R&D, Head of Biology
A concentration or background in Immunology, Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Data Science and more


Why work with us:

As experts in human drug discovery, we have worked hard to position the company for success and to expand our team. We are funded by some of the world's best investors: Y Combinator, Refactor Capital, Breakout Ventures, leaders from pharma, tech, government, and more. You're joining an incredibly ambitious team at an early enough time to help us define our culture, choices, and impact success. We will have the highest expectations of you, just as we do of ourselves. Join us in re-imagining what's possible with immunotherapy!

We are building a diverse, interdisciplinary team of dreamers and doers. Forget incrementalism and leave low-risk ideas at the door. We're looking for fellow visionaries hungry for real impact in reimagining every facet of how we cure disease. Some of our values: first principles thinking, burning passion, and a drive to work with people with like-minded values; thinking outside the box and the ability to envision that which has not yet been built; listen, then talk; don't forget to have fun; cooperation, trust, ethics, and transparency.

          Parallel Bio finds the fastest path to drugs that work for more people by starting in human systems first. Our platform replicates the human immune system in a dish across populations to discover cures at a pace never seen before. Come join us on our mission to flip the 95% drug failure rate to a 95% success rate.<br><br><strong>What we do:<br><br></strong>Our immune systems are master regulators of health and disease. Current tools used to discover drugs that target the immune system are wildly inadequate. To fix this critical gap, Parallel Bio created a human 'immune system in a dish' to rapidly accelerate the development of new drugs and immunotherapies more likely to work in patients. This is the first step on our journey to build a new type of biopharma by reimagining the way we cure disease. Our mission is to design and engineer breakthrough tools inspired by human biology, starting with replacing ineffectual mouse and synthetic platforms.<br><br><strong>Who you are:<br><br></strong>You are someone excited about what we are doing at Parallel Bio and have a scientific background. Please submit your information here if you have a background in the following:<br><br><ul><li><strong>Have held a position like</strong> junior scientist, principal scientist, data scientist, Head of R&amp;D, Head of Biology</li><li><strong>A concentration or background </strong>in Immunology, Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Data Science and more<br><br></li></ul><strong>Why work with us:<br><br></strong>As experts in human drug discovery, we have worked hard to position the company for success and to expand our team. We are funded by some of the world's best investors: Y Combinator, Refactor Capital, Breakout Ventures, leaders from pharma, tech, government, and more. You're joining an incredibly ambitious team at an early enough time to help us define our culture, choices, and impact success. We will have the highest expectations of you, just as we do of ourselves. Join us in re-imagining what's possible with immunotherapy!<br><br>We are building a diverse, interdisciplinary team of dreamers and doers. Forget incrementalism and leave low-risk ideas at the door. We're looking for fellow visionaries hungry for real impact in reimagining every facet of how we cure disease. Some of our values: first principles thinking, burning passion, and a drive to work with people with like-minded values; thinking outside the box and the ability to envision that which has not yet been built; listen, then talk; don't forget to have fun; cooperation, trust, ethics, and transparency.

• Characterize formulations for chemical, physical, processing, and stability attributes

• Apply chemical and mechanical principles to investigate and optimize formulations

• Work closely with engineering, process, and analytical teams

• Communicate findings internally

• Written: clear plans and reports for R&D programs

• In small groups: productive and collaborative discussions

• Department- and company-wide: focused presentations

• Be accountable for, and complete and accurate with data, communication, and

timelines

• Help discover and develop novel approaches to control drug release and gastric

residence
