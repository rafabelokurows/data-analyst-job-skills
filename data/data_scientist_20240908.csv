As data engineer at Seqana you will acquire and harmonize data on soils to unlock the potential of soil carbon sequestration for climate protection.

About Seqana:

Seqana is an EU- and venture-backed start-up building monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) tools to drive soil carbon sequestration and the transition towards regenerative and climate-preserving agriculture.

One of the most powerful (and underutilized) solutions to climate change is capturing carbon in soils via regenerative agricultural practices. This approach has the potential for several times more climate impact than planting forests, while also providing extensive co-benefits such as erosion mitigation and improved water quality, food security, and biodiversity.

Existing solutions for MRV for the carbon market are one of the main drivers of cost and effort, and often the limiting factor for new project development. At Seqana, we combine satellite imagery, our extensive proprietary library of soil datasets, and machine learning to provide an accurate, cost-effective, and efficient MRV solution for soil organic carbon. Our product enables project developers, large corporations and NGOS with a scalable solution to measure and quantify the impact of their regenerative agricultural practices on soil carbon sequestration, enabling them to report credible CO2 reductions.

Tasks

Our growing team is looking for an ambitious and driven soil data scientist to help us quantify soil organic carbon and its sequestration by using better data.

Manage the onboarding of new datasets and implement rigorous data quality processes
Apply a soil science perspective and ensure that our data pipelines and modeling approaches are grounded in a deep understanding of soil processes and dynamics
Standardize our data discovery, acquisition, and harmonization processes
Develop analytical data models and dashboards to serve the needs of insights and analytics
Collaborate with stakeholders across the company to constantly optimize the data infrastructure and associated processes



Requirements

What you bring:


A track record of research in soil science, particularly in SOC and its implications for climate change and agricultural land management
2-4 years of experience in data science roles or equivalent, with a strong foundation in statistical analysis
Proficiency in Python and SQL - with experience in automating data processing and conducting data analyses
Experience with soil sampling methods, laboratory analysis techniques, and understanding of SOC measurement best practices and standards
Ability to work and communicate effectively in an agile, fast-paced startup environment
A proactive, can-do attitude with the ability to quickly adapt, learn, and embrace change
Passion for environmental sustainability and climate tech



What makes you stand out:


Bonus: Knowledge of leading voluntary carbon standards and methodologies, e.g. VCS, Gold Standard or CAR
Bonus: Experience in carbon statistical modeling or process-based models such as Century, RothC, or DNDC
Bonus: Experience with machine learning, including model training and evaluation, is a big plus



Benefits

Benefits you can expect:


Be part of our highly motivated, committed, and international team with flat hierarchies that is working on solving one of societies’ biggest challenges: Climate Change
Witness and shape the evolution of a new business being built
Collaborative DevOps culture with opportunities for continuous learning and improvement
Work in a casual environment with flexible hours and some ability to work from home
Competitive salary, benefits, and compensation package
Drinks, snacks, team events, and your choice of hardware

Data Engineer - MLOps Focus

Berlin based - m/f/d - full-time

What We Do At Plato

Plato is building the digital backbone of the global trade economy. Starting with the $48T wholesale industry, we empower the modern wholesaler to connect their people and data in a single analytics and workflow hub. By leveraging data science and AI, we automate workflows and combat labor shortages, making SMB wholesalers competitive with large corporations.

Why We Do What We Do

The future of wholesale is data-driven. Unlike popular opinion, Industrial SMEs are ready to make the step to become more proactive in their processes but lack the technology to steer them to success. Our founders come from a wholesale family and gathered a rock star team of ex-Big Tech, VC, and top-tier consulting companies to reshape the operations of this $48tn industry. Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.

What We’re Looking For

MLOps = DataOps + DevOps + ModelOps

At Plato, we are building a real-time data platform. As a member of our team, you will play a pivotal role in developing and maintaining the infrastructure that powers our ML solutions.

A significant challenge we face is onboarding a large number of customers onto our platform, where automation and repeatability are crucial for success. This role combines the best of data engineering with the demands of machine learning operations, ensuring the seamless operation of data pipelines and ML models from development to production.

The ideal candidate is an innovative problem-solver who is passionate about both data engineering and MLOps. You will thrive in our dynamic startup environment, wearing multiple hats when required to meet our evolving needs. Your ability to collaborate across teams, automate processes, and ensure repeatability will be key to driving our data and ML infrastructure forward.

What You’d Be Working On


Design, develop, and manage scalable and robust data pipelines that support machine learning models in production.
Implement and maintain CI/CD pipelines for data and ML workflows, ensuring smooth transitions from development to production.
Automate the onboarding process for new customers, ensuring scalability and repeatability across deployments.
Collaborate with data scientists and AI Engineers to optimize and automate data processing and model deployment.
Ensure the seamless integration of ML models with production environments, enabling real-time and batch inference capabilities.
Develop and maintain tools and frameworks for automated data management, model retraining, and monitoring.
Utilize MLFlow for model tracking, versioning, and lifecycle management.
Implement model serving solutions to deploy and manage real-time inference pipelines.
Work closely with our product, engineering, and data science teams to build and maintain a data platform that scales with our growing customer base.
Establish and enforce best practices for data and ML pipeline versioning, experimentation, and reproducibility.



What You Bring Along


3+ years of experience in data engineering, ML Engineering or a related field, with a strong focus on MLOps.
Experience in building and managing data pipelines that feed into machine learning models.
Very good knowledge of Python; experience with PySpark is appreciated.
Hands-on experience with data engineering tools and platforms; a background in Databricks is highly valued.
Experience with MLFlow for model tracking and lifecycle management.
Familiarity with model serving technologies and deploying models for real-time inference.
Familiarity with CI/CD tools and processes, including Jenkins, Git, or similar.
Ability to wear multiple hats and thrive in a startup environment where flexibility and initiative are key.
A mindset that embraces continuous improvement, automation, and scalability, particularly in customer onboarding and deployment processes.

About Merchant Group at Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business. Their core mission is to provide merchants with self-service tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use.

About The Merchant Analytics Team

Merchant Analytics is an embedded analytics function within the Merchant Group. The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

AI is transforming everything, and we make sure the right people are ahead of the curve. We do so by creating AI breakthroughs with our clients.




For us, creating breakthroughs is an irresistible adventure that we want to do 1000 times over. That’s why we are called One Thousand. And as a profitable, fast-growing company, we are on track as never before!




To create AI breakthroughs, our team of 15 friendly nerds identifies pain points and solves them with fast-paced MVPs. And: We enable the broader transformation of our clients into an AI powerhouse.




If you are keen to help Europe finally speed up in AI and would love to have warm outliers around you, join us now! We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer (m/w/d) who identifies with most of the following:




What we care about

Inherent Drive for Greatness: Our world-class team of outliers ships AI breakthroughs extremely fast while ensuring quality standards are met. We are people who feel like they still have something to prove – and we do so by working on something 1000x greater than us.
Relentless Resourcefulness: Creating AI breakthroughs requires the ability to thrive in uncertainty. We have the strength to bounce back and a tenacity to keep pushing to go where it hurts. We balance persistence with lightness.
Infectious Enthusiasm: We care about making AI a blast for everyone involved. With electrifying empathy, we propel our clients forward in understanding, building, and thriving with AI and boost our team with the opportunity to shape our future.




What the role is about

You will have the chance to shape fast-paced AI breakthrough projects. You will ensure our Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) are productionized as MVPs to generate business value.
You will be responsible for building data pipelines, running ML workflows, developing web services, deploying them on cloud environments, and supporting integration with our clients’ systems.
You will be a key contributor in growing our high-impact start-up and shaping our identity – both internally and externally.
You will be working not only with corporates but also be bringing AI to large international NGOs, the “Mittelstand,” scale-ups, unions, or the public sector.
You will have the chance to fully be yourself and will be embraced if you respect the others :-)

You thrive on solving practical ML problems and are comfortable working within a team to deliver impactful solutions.
Bringing technical depth: You can solve diverse software engineering challenges with a flexible toolbox and love fostering good quality code. You have a strong foundation in Python and SQL. Besides that, you have experience with setting up secure web applications (e.g., working with SSL certificates). You bring experience with RDBMS (preferably PostgreSQL) and with at least one cloud platform (preferably, Microsoft Azure), too.
Being dedicated: You don't have to master everything, yet you fully support the team to reach our goals in a result-oriented way of working while fostering a culture of caring.
Dealing with ambiguity: Even if some challenges are vaguely defined, you make sense of what needs to be done.




Ideally, you also bring the following

Ability to communicate in German with level B2 or higher.
Experience with data science tools (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, ...).
Experience working with LLMs (OpenAI / Claude API).
Experience in building front-end solutions.

About the Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has got Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Develop and automate forecasting models to plan the capacity of the support centers across different locations.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track scheduling efficiency, occupancy rates, and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building forecasting models & time series analysis (Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters or similar).
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in Cost Analysis, What-if Scenario Analysis, Capacity planning, and Workforce Management is nice to have but not mandatory.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

What does the hiring process look like?


Initial call with a member of our Technical Recruiting team
Video call with an Engineering Team Lead
Technical Assessment to show your skills (Home Test or Live Coding)
Debrief of your Tech Assessment with Engineering Team member
Final Interview with a VP Engineering

About the Team

The Selection Analytics Team at Wolt owns the data and infrastructure that helps all 27 of our markets build a portfolio of high-quality restaurant and retail merchants. Our overarching mission is to provide the best selection to customers by enabling sales teams across all markets to acquire the best merchants.

To do this, we work directly with country sales teams to help them identify and prioritize the highest potential merchant candidates. We also work with Wolt leadership by providing metrics to track selection quality, upon which they develop strategic initiatives and goals. This is a lean and mighty team that owns and operates the engine for merchant acquisition globally.

About The Role

As a senior member of the Selection Analytics team, your role involves leveling up our approach to identifying and prioritizing better merchants. You’ll achieve this by a) developing metrics to unlock deeper insights into merchant selection quality for all markets b) developing and running experiments to understand the impact of selection on specific markets c) develop self-serve tooling to track these insights

This is also a rare, high-exposure experience where you will then use your findings to work directly with country leadership to help them uncover growth opportunities. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just crunching numbers and creating dashboards.

The team is looking for a versatile analytics expert who knows how to move fast, work cross-functionally, and deliver business results. If you are excited to build from 0 to 1, interested in global exposure, and have experience using deep analytics to solve hard problems - we're looking for someone like you.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these cities - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.

Our humble expectations


3-5 years of experience in data science, consulting, or related quantitative role
Strong exploratory data analysis skills, willingness to look under the hood.
Deep understanding of the data science workflow, including experimental design and key statistical methods, with strong communication skills for complex topics.
Proficiency in statistical programming languages (R, Python, etc.) and SQL.
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g. Looker)
Determination to initiate and lead/own strategic projects to completion in a scrappy environment with a cross-functional team
Innate curiosity to understand how things work and a first-principles approach to problem solving


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Lead - Marta Palac (marta.palac@wolt.com).

About Wolt

Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers. It connects people looking to order food and other goods with people interested in selling and delivering them. To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions – as well as operating its own grocery stores under the Wolt Market brand. Wolt’s products include Wolt+ (subscription service for customers), Wolt for Work (meal benefits and office deliveries for companies), Wolt Drive (fast last-mile deliveries for merchants) and Wolt Self-Delivery (service for merchant partners with their own delivery staff). Wolt’s mission is to make cities better by empowering and growing local communities. Wolt was founded in 2014 and joined forces with DoorDash in 2022. DoorDash operates in 29 countries today, 25 of which are with the Wolt product and brand.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 700+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 60 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together.

About the Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has got Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Develop and automate forecasting models to plan the capacity of the support centers across different locations.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track scheduling efficiency, occupancy rates, and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building forecasting models & time series analysis (Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters or similar).
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in Cost Analysis, What-if Scenario Analysis, Capacity planning, and Workforce Management is nice to have but not mandatory.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

AI is transforming everything, and we make sure the right people are ahead of the curve. We do so by creating AI breakthroughs with our clients.




For us, creating breakthroughs is an irresistible adventure that we want to do 1000 times over. That’s why we are called One Thousand. And as a profitable, fast-growing company, we are on track as never before!




To create AI breakthroughs, our team of 15 friendly nerds identifies pain points and solves them with fast-paced MVPs. And: We enable the broader transformation of our clients into an AI powerhouse.




If you are keen to help Europe finally speed up in AI and would love to have warm outliers around you, join us now! We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer (m/w/d) who identifies with most of the following:




What we care about

Inherent Drive for Greatness: Our world-class team of outliers ships AI breakthroughs extremely fast while ensuring quality standards are met. We are people who feel like they still have something to prove – and we do so by working on something 1000x greater than us.
Relentless Resourcefulness: Creating AI breakthroughs requires the ability to thrive in uncertainty. We have the strength to bounce back and a tenacity to keep pushing to go where it hurts. We balance persistence with lightness.
Infectious Enthusiasm: We care about making AI a blast for everyone involved. With electrifying empathy, we propel our clients forward in understanding, building, and thriving with AI and boost our team with the opportunity to shape our future.




What the role is about

You will have the chance to shape fast-paced AI breakthrough projects. You will ensure our Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) are productionized as MVPs to generate business value.
You will be responsible for building data pipelines, running ML workflows, developing web services, deploying them on cloud environments, and supporting integration with our clients’ systems.
You will be a key contributor in growing our high-impact start-up and shaping our identity – both internally and externally.
You will be working not only with corporates but also be bringing AI to large international NGOs, the “Mittelstand,” scale-ups, unions, or the public sector.
You will have the chance to fully be yourself and will be embraced if you respect the others :-)




What we would love to see

Knowing how to execute real-life software projects: You have at least 3 years of experience in building scalable software projects in a professional manner.
Leveraging AI Expertise: You have hands-on experience implementing machine learning models in production environments, including model training, deployment, and monitoring. You are proficient with machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn) and understand the full ML lifecycle, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and optimization. You thrive on solving practical ML problems and are comfortable working within a team to deliver impactful solutions.
Bringing technical depth: You can solve diverse software engineering challenges with a flexible toolbox and love fostering good quality code. You have a strong foundation in Python and SQL. Besides that, you have experience with setting up secure web applications (e.g., working with SSL certificates). You bring experience with RDBMS (preferably PostgreSQL) and with at least one cloud platform (preferably, Microsoft Azure), too.
Being dedicated: You don't have to master everything, yet you fully support the team to reach our goals in a result-oriented way of working while fostering a culture of caring.
Dealing with ambiguity: Even if some challenges are vaguely defined, you make sense of what needs to be done.




Ideally, you also bring the following

Ability to communicate in German with level B2 or higher.
Experience with data science tools (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, ...).
Experience working with LLMs (OpenAI / Claude API).
Experience in building front-end solutions.
Experience with Docker.
Experience integrating web services with SAP.
Openness to travel to clients location 2-3 times a month.




What we offer

Ascension – as we are going to push and enable you to do the best work of your life.
Anti-Mimeticism – as we are on the journey to 1000 AI breakthroughs since long before the recent hype.
Captivating AI breakthrough projects with a lot of room for personal development, experimentation, continuous learning, and growth.
A unique role in a pioneering AI company with autonomy in shaping and leading key endeavors that contribute to the advancement of AI applications.
A professional, yet flexible work environment, innovative work practices along “No rules rules,” and continuous mutual support.
A value-driven business with top-of-market pay for a Machine Learning Engineer.
All the other start-up stuff such as free drinks and snacks, game nights, ...




We are determined to foster and embrace diversity – not just among our clients but especially within our own walls. We believe that this will make our organisation and quality of work better, but more importantly, we strongly believe it is the right thing to do.




Sounds like a “wow” opportunity? You would like to get to know us and the One Thousand better? Great – we can’t wait to hear from you! Please apply via LinkedIn.

Whether people and businesses are sending money to another country, spending abroad, or making and receiving international payments, Wise is on a mission to make their life easier and save them money.

As part of our team, you will be helping us create an entirely new network for the world's money. For everyone, everywhere. More about our mission.

Job Description

Data Scientist - Marketing

We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our growing Marketing Team in London. This role is a unique opportunity to have an impact on Wise’s mission, grow as a Data Scientist and help save people money.

Your Mission

Wise has already pioneered new ways for people to transfer money across borders and currencies. Our customers can also manage their hard-earned money with the world’s first platform to offer true multi-currency banking. Your mission is to help make people aware of Wise as a solution for cross-border money needs.

Here’s How You’ll Be Contributing To Marketing


You will help the Marketing tribe find the biggest opportunities for growth
You will do this by developing predictive models to calculate Customer Lifetime Value (LTV), aiding in the prioritization of marketing efforts and resource allocation.
You will model customer behaviour data and product usage so we understand which audiences to target and how
You will also use causal models to measure the incremental effect that CRM and Invite campaigns have on business metrics. You will use causal inference to decide which campaigns should be delivered to each user.
You will help us understand in what growth activity to invest (Marketing Mix Models)
You will work closely with Data Analysts and you will help them understand and use models that you build (LTV or MMM models)
Your average day will include building new models, maintaining models used by everyone in the marketing tribe, evaluating new ideas and communicating what models can tell us about how we do marketing


This Role Will Give You The Opportunity To


Have a direct impact - You will closely partner with every marketing team within both Organic and Paid Acquisition and help millions of people and businesses to learn about how Wise can help them
Work autonomously - we believe people are most empowered when they can act autonomously. So rather than telling you what to do, you’ll work with your team to create a vision of your own. Of course, you can always gather feedback from smart, curious people across Wise but you’ll have the freedom to make your own calls.
Be part of a diverse team - You will work in a team of Data scientists, Analysts and Marketeers
Be part of our mission to make money without borders the new normal


Qualifications

About you:


You are familiar with lifetime value (LTV) modelling and econometrics/marketing mix modelling
You have experience with Bayesian approaches to machine learning, as well as with using neural networks, ideally PyTorch
You have a good understanding of statistics, in particular Bayesian reasoning, and can estimate how accurate your results are, but also know when to stop analysing and deliver results
You have a good understanding of causal inference concepts and have some experience with machine learning models for causal inference.
You are familiar with a range of model types, and know when and why to use gradient boosting, neural networks, good old linear regression, or a blend of these
You have expert knowledge of Python, and are able to make and justify design decisions in your Python code; you can throw together a REST service or a UI if need be. You’ve used external data pulled via APIs before
You understand fundamental technologies such as Kafka and Docker, and don’t think twice about bringing up a new engine in docker-compose to have a play
You are able to take ownership of a project and see it through from end to end, with past experience in doing so
You are data-driven with a structural and pedantic approach. You need to be able to prioritise the value you can add, and manage your time effectively.
You see a bigger picture of business processes and can cut through vagueness to define precisely where and how a model would fit into our stack and what value it would add.
You are comfortable with visualising and communicating data to various audiences, you easily articulate and present your ideas.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.

Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is to maximise business impact within one of many business areas. You will help answer questions like:



Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?



The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Requirements



A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)
Experience conducting A/B experiments
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems



Why Deliveroo

Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.

We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

Workplace & Benefits

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed.

Job Description

We have recently established a Data Science team at the centre of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT). The team's mission is to engage with every corner of the department to uncover opportunities where innovative and experimental data science techniques can enhance existing products, processes, and analysis or generate entirely novel insights. This spans across sectors from telecoms to quantum to AI, all while embracing the possibility of failure as a path to discovery. Through this, we will help set the strategic direction for a department that prioritises data, evidence, and real-time monitoring, and ensure that DSIT becomes data-confident. 

This role offers an unparalleled opportunity to shape and define your position within an established team, pitching project ideas and exploring novel collaborations. Your contribution will help further a team culture that fosters creativity and innovation in leveraging the latest developments in data science, such as generative AI and LLMs, to deliver transformative insights. You will be joining at a critical time, with the chance to influence how data science shapes the department's impact in a still-evolving landscape.  

We are looking for highly motivated individuals to join us as we refine our operating model to enhance DSIT's data science capability. Technical skills are necessary for the role, but we are equally interested in your ability to be a proactive, independent thinker, eager to contribute to a team culture of innovation and collaboration. Our work will touch on exciting policy areas and involve collaboration with analytical teams across the department (such as the Government Office for Science), arms-length bodies (e.g. UK Research and Innovation and the UK Space Agency), and executive agencies (e.g., Building Digital UK). This means we will have the opportunity to explore many fascinating projects, either independently as a team or in collaboration with the analytical teams embedded across the department. Innovation is enshrined in the name, delivery plan, and ethos of the department, so we will have every opportunity to explore new ideas, trial novel approaches, and have the freedom to carve our own path. 

We have a vision for the team to be highly collaborative and proactively inclusive, with the flexibility to respond quickly to urgent asks while building out longer-term data science projects and products. We have access to multiple data science platforms and sandbox areas, meaning you can access truly novel tools and be working on cutting-edge data science techniques. Additionally, learning and development is a core focus of the team, with an afternoon a week reserved as protected time specifically for self-directed learning and development. We celebrate and value this L&D, and actively cascade outputs between members of the team.

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

Who are we and why do we do what we do?

We are a data and payments company on a mission! We’re a group of developers, financial experts, and optimists who share a vision for improving the financial wellness of people, their businesses, and their communities.

We started this company with the aim of changing how the industry used and viewed data. As architects of Open Banking, Open Finance, and Open Data, we strive to be a force for good — changing the status quo of how businesses interact with people. We strive to serve the whole population through every change in their finances.

We do this by powering businesses through our APIs and Personal Finance Tech solutions as well as our own personal financial management app for consumers.

We can only do that by being an inclusive and diverse organisation. We invest in our people, and enjoy an environment focused on innovation, collaboration and openness.

What do we offer?

We champion flexibility, and we trust and respect our employees to deliver results in a way that best suits them, working around their own lives and commitments.

We live and breathe a fantastic culture of remote working and you may perform your duties predominantly from your home. However, the heart of Moneyhub is in Bristol and from time to time you will be required to attend company meet ups. Your role may require you to attend client meetings, networking events or group training sessions. You may also be required to work at such other place or places as we may reasonably require from time to time. As a minimum, you will be required to attend a quarterly All Team Away Day at a location of our choice (including overseas).

As well as a truly flexible approach, we also offer a fantastic range of benefits, including:

Remote working - with quarterly away days, regular team meeting and face to face client meetings as required.

10% contribution towards your Pension from your very first day with us;

25 days of holiday (plus bank hols), rising to 30 days after two years;

Choose to take your entitlement to UK bank holidays at other times based on your own days of significance;

Private medical insurance, including cover for pre-existing conditions, plus dental and optical benefit;

Six week Moneyhubber Family Pay when you become a new parent;

Permanent health insurance and life cover - much greater than the industry standard (death in service);

Employee assistance programme;

Professional development support, with dedicated allowance of time and money;

Life event leave;

Cycle to work scheme;

EV Salary sacrifice scheme;

£750 towards professional memberships

Remote working benefits, including work from almost anywhere, access to co-working spaces and support for your home office set-up

High spec laptop

Requirements

Sounds great right? What will you be doing?

The Data Science capability at Moneyhub generates value from a rich repository of data sources. Its function is critical to the day-to-day running of the business, and it also spearheads the development of novel ideas to exploit new commercial opportunities.

You Can Expect To Work On


The Machine Learning based transaction categorisation engine that underpins the budgeting capabilities of the app and affordability checking, e.g. for mortgages.

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

Joining Zego is a career-defining move. People go further here, reaching their full potential to achieve extraordinary things. 

We're spread throughout the UK and Europe, and united by our drive to get things done. We're proud of our company and our culture - a friendly and inclusive space where we can lift each other up and celebrate our wins every day.

Together, we're setting the bar higher, delivering exceptional work that makes a difference. Our people are the most important part of our story, and everyone here plays a role. There's loads of room to learn and grow, and you'll get the freedom to steer your career wherever you want.

You'll work alongside a talented group who embrace each other's differences and aren't afraid of a challenge. We recognise our achievements, learn from our mistakes, and help each other to be the best we can be. Together, we're making insurance matter. 

How we work

We believe that teams work better when they have time to collaborate and space to get things done. We call it Zego Hybrid.

Our hybrid way of working is unique. We don't mandate fixed office days. Instead, we foster a flexible approach that empowers every Zegon to perform at their best. We ask you to spend at least one day a week in our central London office. You have the flexibility to choose the day that works best for you and your team. We cover the costs for all company-wide events (3 per year), and also provide a separate hybrid contribution to help pay towards other travel costs. We think it's a good mix of collaborative face time and flexible home-working, setting us up to achieve the right balance between work and life.

Benefits

We reward our people well. Join us and you'll get a market-competitive salary, private medical insurance, company share options, generous holiday allowance, and a whole lot of wellbeing benefits. And that's just for starters.

We're an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

Float is one of Canada's fastest growing companies and Top Startups, serving Canadian businesses with our innovative smart corporate card and spend management solution. Float's team is customer-obsessed, passionate, vibrant, and entrepreneurial, and includes executives from Uber, Shopify, Ritual, and many other incredible tech companies!

At Float, everyone is an owner, bringing their unique perspective to our team and product. Your voice is important, and we take having a culture based on feedback seriously. We openly share our thoughts, feedback, and differing opinions so we can continue to improve. We do our best to keep our decision making decentralized so that all team members contribute.

Our Product

Float empowers companies and teams with smart financial products, helping them achieve their most ambitious goals. We're making finance more accessible and saving companies and their teams time and money, while disrupting the multi-trillion dollar global B2B finance industry. Backed by some of the best venture capital investors in the world, including Tiger Global, Golden Ventures, and Susa Ventures, we're looking for pioneers to help us achieve our vision.

About The Senior Data Scientist Role

We're looking for an experienced Data Scientist to play a foundational role in shaping Float's data science capabilities, strategies and to continue to build out our Data Science team.

Requirements

As a Senior Data Scientist at Float:


You'll develop a data strategy that is aligned to Float's strategy, identify key metrics, which data needs to be collected, and set the processes for how data will be stored, cleaned, and maintained at Float
You'll build upon Float's data infrastructure and determine which technologies and tools the company should use for its data science activities
You'll build and maintain our data warehouse, using DBT to transform our data unlocking deeper analytics and empowering those outside the data team to use data in their day-to-day
You'll work closely with the product team to build data-led products
You'll analyze large-scale, complex datasets to extract meaningful insights and drive decision-making
You'll evaluate the performance of existing models and propose enhancements to improve accuracy, efficiency, and scalability
You'll work closely with all teams across Float to understand their data needs and provide solutions



You'll be great in this role if:


You're an owner. You love a challenge, and take great satisfaction in tackling them head on. You love being a pioneer and taking on any task (big or small) and driving it through to completion. You are also comfortable making independent decisions and following your instincts to be able to move quickly
You're able to explain complex data in simple terms. As you'll be communicating your findings to different stakeholders, your ability to present data in an understandable way is vital
You have solid technical skills. Strong skills in data modeling, data structures, data mining, predictive modeling and analysis tools (such as Python, SQL, DBT), and data visualization tools, are crucial. Understanding of machine learning algorithms and statistics is an asset
You understand the business context. You'll be more effective if you understand not just how to work with data, but also why you're working with it - i.e., how it will impact the business and drive decisions
You're comfortable with a fast-paced environment. Float is a dynamic environment and things can change quickly. You should be flexible and able to adapt to changes as they occur
You can balance attention to detail and strategic thinking. While it's important to delve into the details of your data, it's equally important to keep the big picture in mind
You ruthlessly prioritize. You will have multiple responsibilities and projects. Being able to effectively manage your workload and meet deadlines is crucial
You have an experimental mindset. The ability to design and analyze experiments will be very helpful in optimizing products and making business decisions
You're eager to continue your own learning. Scrappy and voracious, you want to know the ‘why' behind every answer. You love to have healthy debates with fellow developers and colleagues about the product



This role won't be a fit if:


You're not extremely detail oriented
You are not open to a hybrid role (based in Toronto)
You aren't a self-starter and don't like to work independently
You're not comfortable wearing multiple hats
You don't like change and adapting to new ways of doing things
You aren't comfortable with ambiguity
You aren't able to translate technical jargon into simple language
You lack patience for iterative work
You want detailed to-dos for your tasks and projects
You're not keen on learning new things
You don't have strong stakeholder management skills
You don't like regular feedback on your work


Don't meet every single requirement? If you're excited about this role, and you strongly align with our values but your past experience doesn't align perfectly, we encourage you to apply anyway. You may be the right candidate for this, or other future positions.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.

What you’ll do

As a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.

Responsibilities


Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


A Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2025, or equivalent work experience
Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts



Preferred Qualifications


One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$104,000 - C$156,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

Float is one of Canada's fastest growing companies and Top Startups, serving Canadian businesses with our innovative smart corporate card and spend management solution. Float's team is customer-obsessed, passionate, vibrant, and entrepreneurial, and includes executives from Uber, Shopify, Ritual, and many other incredible tech companies!

At Float, everyone is an owner, bringing their unique perspective to our team and product. Your voice is important, and we take having a culture based on feedback seriously. We openly share our thoughts, feedback, and differing opinions so we can continue to improve. We do our best to keep our decision making decentralized so that all team members contribute.

Our Product

Float empowers companies and teams with smart financial products, helping them achieve their most ambitious goals. We're making finance more accessible and saving companies and their teams time and money, while disrupting the multi-trillion dollar global B2B finance industry. Backed by some of the best venture capital investors in the world, including Tiger Global, Golden Ventures, and Susa Ventures, we're looking for pioneers to help us achieve our vision.

About The Senior Data Scientist Role

We're looking for an experienced Data Scientist to play a foundational role in shaping Float's data science capabilities, strategies and to continue to build out our Data Science team.

Requirements

As a Senior Data Scientist at Float:


You'll develop a data strategy that is aligned to Float's strategy, identify key metrics, which data needs to be collected, and set the processes for how data will be stored, cleaned, and maintained at Float
You'll build upon Float's data infrastructure and determine which technologies and tools the company should use for its data science activities
You'll build and maintain our data warehouse, using DBT to transform our data unlocking deeper analytics and empowering those outside the data team to use data in their day-to-day
You'll work closely with the product team to build data-led products
You'll analyze large-scale, complex datasets to extract meaningful insights and drive decision-making
You'll evaluate the performance of existing models and propose enhancements to improve accuracy, efficiency, and scalability
You'll work closely with all teams across Float to understand their data needs and provide solutions



You'll be great in this role if:


You're an owner. You love a challenge, and take great satisfaction in tackling them head on. You love being a pioneer and taking on any task (big or small) and driving it through to completion. You are also comfortable making independent decisions and following your instincts to be able to move quickly
You're able to explain complex data in simple terms. As you'll be communicating your findings to different stakeholders, your ability to present data in an understandable way is vital
You have solid technical skills. Strong skills in data modeling, data structures, data mining, predictive modeling and analysis tools (such as Python, SQL, DBT), and data visualization tools, are crucial. Understanding of machine learning algorithms and statistics is an asset
You understand the business context. You'll be more effective if you understand not just how to work with data, but also why you're working with it - i.e., how it will impact the business and drive decisions
You're comfortable with a fast-paced environment. Float is a dynamic environment and things can change quickly. You should be flexible and able to adapt to changes as they occur
You can balance attention to detail and strategic thinking. While it's important to delve into the details of your data, it's equally important to keep the big picture in mind
You ruthlessly prioritize. You will have multiple responsibilities and projects. Being able to effectively manage your workload and meet deadlines is crucial
You have an experimental mindset. The ability to design and analyze experiments will be very helpful in optimizing products and making business decisions
You're eager to continue your own learning. Scrappy and voracious, you want to know the ‘why' behind every answer. You love to have healthy debates with fellow developers and colleagues about the product



This role won't be a fit if:


You're not extremely detail oriented
You are not open to a hybrid role (based in Toronto)
You aren't a self-starter and don't like to work independently
You're not comfortable wearing multiple hats
You don't like change and adapting to new ways of doing things
You aren't comfortable with ambiguity
You aren't able to translate technical jargon into simple language
You lack patience for iterative work
You want detailed to-dos for your tasks and projects
You're not keen on learning new things
You don't have strong stakeholder management skills
You don't like regular feedback on your work


Don't meet every single requirement? If you're excited about this role, and you strongly align with our values but your past experience doesn't align perfectly, we encourage you to apply anyway. You may be the right candidate for this, or other future positions.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.

What you’ll do

As a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.

Responsibilities


Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


A Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2025, or equivalent work experience
Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts



Preferred Qualifications


One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$104,000 - C$156,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Ensure engineering outcomes meet or exceed established standards of excellence in code quality, system design, and scalability
Mentor engineers earlier in their technical careers to help them grow
Propose and implement innovative product ideas to reduce costs and combat fraud at Stripe



Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Over 3+ years industry experience building machine learning applications in large scale distributed systems.
2+ year of experience working within a team responsible for developing, managing, and optimizing ML models or ML infrastructure
Experience designing and training machine learning models to solve critical business problems
Experience performing analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to model performance and business metrics



Preferred Qualifications


An advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. stats, physics, computer science)
Proven track record of building and deploying machine learning systems that have effectively solved critical business problems
Experience in adversarial domains like Payments, Fraud, Trust, or Safety
Experience working in Python, Java and / or Ruby codebases

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $173,100 - $316,800. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the world’s best — and most fun — place to book travel. By leveraging massive amounts of data, advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to help customers spend less and travel better. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the app has been downloaded nearly 80 million times and continues to gain market share globally.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:


Hopper sold around $4 billion in travel and travel fintech in 2022, up nearly 3X over 2021. In 2022, Hopper increased its revenue 2.5X year-over year.
The company’s bespoke fintech products, such as Flight Disruption Guarantee and Price Freeze, now represent 30-40% of Hopper’s total app revenue.
Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud in late 2021. Through this partnership program, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory. As its first Hopper Cloud partnership,
Hopper partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders.
Recognized as one of the world’s most innovative companies by Fast Company four years in a row, Hopper has been downloaded over 80 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month.
Hopper has raised over $700 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""which piece of Python code is better?"" to ""make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterwards to make it faster""

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, 2 Hour Learning. Have you got what it takes?

Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.

At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.

Your Role in the Revolution:

In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.

This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.

Who We're Looking For:

We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What You Will Be Doing


Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.
Drive Technical Projects: Take ownership of the entire development process, from gathering requirements to launching and iterating on products. You’ll work closely with stakeholders to ensure that our solutions meet learner needs and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
Collaborate and Communicate: Partner with a global team of developers, designers, and educational experts. Your ability to communicate complex ideas simply and effectively will be key to your success.
Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.


What You Won’t Be Doing


Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.


Artificial Intelligence Engineer Key Responsibilities

Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Basic Requirements


At least 3 years of experience in full-stack development, with proficiency in front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, or Svelte, and back-end technologies like Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Flask, or Spring Boot.

Proven ability to independently manage and execute technical projects from start to finish, including gathering requirements, development, deployment, and iteration.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills, with the ability to collaborate effectively with stakeholders, team members, and users across a global, remote team.
A demonstrated passion for staying at the forefront of technology, particularly in AI and web development, with a commitment to continuous learning and applying new advancements to your work.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, LearnwithAI. Have you got what it takes?

The EdTech industry is grappling with the challenge of creating engaging and personalized educational content that can keep students motivated and cater to their individual learning needs. In a market flooded with generic and ineffective learning tools, there's a critical need for differentiation. Studies show that student engagement drops significantly when educational content fails to resonate or adapt to their personal learning journey, leading to a gap in effective education delivery. This leads to an increased workload for teachers, who are expected to deliver high-quality, personalized instruction with limited time and resources.

LearnWith.AI is addressing this challenge head-on by leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies to revolutionize the creation of educational content. We’re not just building AI tools; we’re developing AI-driven workflows that generate content tailored to the unique needs of students. Imagine being able to design a ""Second Brain"" for subjects like Science or History—a comprehensive, AI-powered repository of domain-specific knowledge that can be harnessed to produce engaging, personalized content at scale. This approach not only sets us apart from competitors but also redefines what’s possible in EdTech, making education more accessible, effective, and enjoyable.

This role isn’t your typical AI engineering position. You won’t just be coding or working on abstract AI models. Instead, you’ll be at the forefront of transforming how students learn by designing and implementing AI-driven workflows that create personalized educational experiences. This is not a job for those who prefer routine tasks or shy away from the challenge of creating a real-world impact. It’s a role for innovators who are passionate about education, thrive on cutting-edge technology, and want to see their work make a tangible difference in students' lives.

As part of our team, you’ll be the architect behind AI-powered educational tools that have the potential to change the landscape of learning. You’ll use LLMs as domain experts to build context packs and second brains, ensuring that our AI produces content that is both relevant and impactful. If you’re excited about the possibility of using AI to reshape education and are ready to take ownership of projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible, we want to hear from you.

What You Will Be Doing


Designing AI-Driven Workflows: Integrating various AI tools, engineering prompts, and refining workflows based on feedback from subject matter experts and users.
Building Context Packs and Second Brains: Using LLMs as domain experts to develop and maintain documents that encapsulate knowledge and unique organizational insights.
