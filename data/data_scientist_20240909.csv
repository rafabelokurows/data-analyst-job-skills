We believe that our youth deserve the very best care, not only for their physical health but also their mental health. Through an integrated community-centered care approach, our skilled clinical team delivers exceptional virtual and in-person care across a wide range of specialties. If you're excited to work for a mission-driven company that values compassion, dedication, and a holistic approach to care, Blackbird Health is a great place to advance your career.

Leveraging 50 million data points across its 10-year database of patient encounters, Blackbird then applies the computational models to determine which ""biotype"" best fits the young person. Blackbird's biotypes are clusters of individuals in its database with similar characteristics. The idea is that more specific diagnoses and previously successful treatment approaches achieved for others may indicate a more appropriate path for a specific patient – and thus reduce the time it takes to get them on the right mix of therapies.

About Phaidra

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, and India.

About DoorDash

At DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.

DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead.

The Risk group consists of machine learning, backend, and full stack engineers who tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We are undertaking several new efforts, where you can have an outsized impact on the architecture, implementation, and design choices behind these systems.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Most importantly, we seek people who are excited about crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.

About Phaidra

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, and India.

Please only apply to one opening. If you are a better fit for another opening, our team will move your application. Candidates who apply to multiple openings will not be considered.

Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.<br><br>Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:<br><br><ul><li>We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.</li><li>We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.</li><li>We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.<br><br></li></ul>Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.<br><br>Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe’s mission is to build the economic infrastructure for the internet. Risk Engineering brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s financial and regulatory risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. We build ML and backend systems to catch fraudsters, understand users’ cash flow and financial health, and ensure Stripe’s users are compliant with regulatory and financial partner requirements. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from financial losses that can put Stripe’s business at risk.

The Risk group consists of machine learning, backend, and full stack engineers who tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We are undertaking several new efforts, where you can have an outsized impact on the architecture, implementation, and design choices behind these systems.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


Designing, training, improving & launching models
Proposing and implementing ideas that directly reduce Stripe’s financial losses
Building systems that evaluate businesses for risk and take appropriate actions
Working with our partner teams to launch new policies that directly impact Stripe’s bottom line
Helping engineers across the company to develop technologies for scaling our infrastructure
Debugging production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 2 years of industry experience in training ML models
Enjoy and have experience shipping ML models in a large-scale production environment
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


Have experience in Python, Scala (Spark), or Ruby



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $173,100 - $259,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our product is intelligent -- all your files are indexed and searchable with a home-grown LLM that can find and even sort and organize your files, search by image and many other file types, and soon ask questions about your files and watch as an AI system references your own files to give an answer.
Our product is lightweight -- we don't install a sync service that's constantly scanning your hard drive and we never need to resolve sync conflicts, ever.
Completely, 100% cross-platform -- Our product looks identical across web and desktop, with zero compromises in the UI/UX, and all your files always available and up-to-date.
Our product improves every 2 days, not every 2 years -- Finder and File Explorer haven't changed in years or decades because they're linked to OS upgrade cycles. Our product ships updates every day and can add all kinds of features, fixes, and file type support at light speed.
Many, many more reasons -- deep folder searching, beautiful view modes, extensible metadata, ergonomics, public sharing, and so much more.


About You

We are looking to grow from two founding teammates (we've accomplished a lot as just one engineer and one designer!) to a clan of around eight, so you'll be anywhere from engineer #2 to #7. You'll be tasked with bringing Poly to life as breakthrough AI service with leading performance on relevant benchmarks, generating novel insights along the way to make Poly the “search engine for your life”.

Specifically, in a AI research engineer role, we are looking for the following concrete skills and prior experience


High baseline knowledge of core statistical modeling principles, including the ability to write down or describe core ML modeling equations such as gradient descent, scaled dot product attention, cross-entropy, and so forth.
Extensive experience with modeling / inference tools such as pytorch and CUDA.
Pragmatic and product focused mindset, with the passion to see any developments make it into customer hands as quickly as possible.
Familiarity with modern LLM-based development fundamentals including prompting, function calling, and agentic workflows.
Knowledge of Python is a must, and enthusiasm for Rust is highly encouraged.
An extreme appetite for learning that you've honed through recursive self-improvement. You should be able to demonstrate an exceptional aptitude for automating your own development processes.
You thrive in independent, inter-disciplinary environments, and you are skilled at collaborating across domains and for productively engaging with people of all kinds.
You are willing to leave judgments about gender, race, creed, background, belief, or politics for outside of the workplace so that we can focus on building the world's best file storage platform for everyone.
You are capable of (and excited to) work in-person 5-days a week in SoMa, San Francisco

Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process.

You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

Salary Hiring Range: $195,000 - $230,000

Our salary ranges are based on paying competitively for our size and industry, and are one part of many compensation, benefits and other reward opportunities we provide (e.g. bonus, stock options, 401(k) match, etc.)

Individual pay rate decisions are based on a number of factors, including qualifications for the role, experience level, skillset, and balancing internal equity relative to peers at the company. We expect the majority of the candidates who are offered roles at our company to fall healthily throughout the range based on these factors.

The range above is for the expectations as laid out in the job description, however we are often open to a wide variety of profiles, and recognize that the person we hire may be less experienced (or more senior) than this job description as posted. If that ends up being the case, the updated salary range will be communicated with you as a candidate.

The salary range above is for the NY/CA. As a company, we have a location based strategy, which means the salary range could be lower or higher than this if the role is hired in another location.

We’re on a mission to make knowledge work faster and more humane. We believe that AI will fundamentally transform how people work. In the future, everyone will work in tandem with expert AI assistants who find knowledge, create and synthesize information, and execute work. These assistants will free people up to focus on the higher-level, creative aspects of their work.

We’re building a system of intelligence for every company in the world. On the surface, you can think of it as Google + ChatGPT for the enterprise. Under the hood, our platform is the connective tissue between AI and knowledge. It brings all of a company’s knowledge together, understands it at a deep level, provides industry-leading search relevance over it, and connects it to generative AI agents and applications.

Glean was founded by a seasoned team of former Google search and Facebook engineers who saw a need in the enterprise space for their technical depth and passion for AI. We’re a diverse team of curious and creative people who want to help each other get big things done—so we can help other teams do the same.

We're backed by some of the Valley's leading venture capitalists—including Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, and General Catalyst—and have assembled a world-class team with senior leadership experience at Google, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox, Rubrik, Uber, Intercom, Pinterest, Palantir, and others.

Role

Glean is building a world-class Data Organization composed of data science, applied science, data engineering and business intelligence groups. This is a data science role based in our headquarters in Palo Alto.

At Glean, data scientists collaborate with engineering, product management and design to:


Define and build data assets, e.g. KPI definitions, data pipelines and dashboards, to measure the performance of AI-powered assistant products for knowledge workers.
Identify opportunities to improve these KPIs, and influence cross functional teams to incorporate associated changes into their roadmaps.
Create and maintain quantitative frameworks and methodologies, e.g. bring more rigor into experiment analyses, use statistical modeling to identify leading indicators of user churn & retention.


This specific role will address one or more of the following business domains:


Accelerating Glean’s adoption, expansion, and usage intensity across all the product surfaces and customer lifecycles by using data to identify, implement and measure the effectiveness of product-led user growth strategies.
Build data assets, e.g. KPI definitions, data pipelines and dashboards, to measure the efficacy of generative AI products executing workflows on behalf of end users, instead of just answering questions and helping them find what they need. These workflows will range from simple to multi-step complex workflows, and will pave the way for AI Agent capabilities that will enable end-users to provide their needs in natural language and achieve those tasks via LLM-powered chain of autonomous execution.


You will thrive at this role if


You have a Bachelors/Masters/PhD degree in Statistics, Mathematics or Computer Science, or another quantitative field.
You have 4+ years of industry experience (3+ for Masters degree holders, 2+ for PhD degree holders).
You are concise and precise in written and verbal communication. Technical documentation is your strong suit.
You are strong at defining good product KPIs/guardrail metrics, dashboarding and analysis of raw data to derive strategic insights.
You are proficient in SQL and the modern data stack (e.g. dbt pipelines for ETL/ELT).
You have experience in writing source-controlled code for pipelines and internal tools for data-oriented decision making.
You are proficient in Python.


You are a particularly good fit if


You have experience in B2B SaaS.
You have experience with remote work across large time zone differences.
You’re strong in statistics and/or machine learning. You have experience in applying these skills into tangible improvements in products, internal tools and processes.


Benefits


Competitive compensation
Medical, Vision and Dental coverage
Flexible work environment and time-off policy
401k
Company events
A home office improvement stipend when you first join
Annual education stipend
Wellness stipend
Healthy lunches and dinners provided daily


For California Based Applicants

The standard base salary range for this position is $145,000 - 225,000 annually. Compensation offered will be determined by factors such as location, level, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. Certain roles may be eligible for variable compensation, equity, and benefits.

We are a diverse bunch of people and we want to continue to attract and retain a diverse range of people into our organization. We're committed to an inclusive and diverse company. We do not discriminate based on gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, civil or family status, age, disability, or race.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article. Please exercise caution and cease communications if something feels suspicious about your interactions.

At Warner Music Group, we’re a global collective of music makers and music lovers, tech innovators and inspired entrepreneurs, game-changing creatives and passionate team members. Here, we know that each talent makes our collective bolder and brighter. We are guided by four core principles that underpin everything we do across all our diverse businesses:


Music is Everything: Music is our passion, and we can never get enough. Tastes, trends, and tech will change, but great artists and songwriters will always be our driving force.
Global Growth, Local Expertise: Music is a global language. Through communication and collaboration, our success can come from anywhere and translate everywhere.
Innovation and Insight: Pushing the boundaries requires the best information and the boldest imagination. We use both to create the future.
Empowered by People: Like the artists we serve and the music they make, our differences make us stronger. This is a place where every talent can belong and build a career.


We remain committed to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We know it fosters a culture where you can truly belong, contribute, and grow. We encourage applications from people of any age, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion, ethnicity, disability, veteran status, and any other characteristic or identity.

Consider a career at WMG and get the best of both worlds – an innovative global music company that retains the creative spirit of a nimble independent.

A little bit about our team:

WMG’s Business Intelligence team (BI) works to influence WMG’s strategy and day-to-day operations by developing thoughtful insights & intelligence from its core business practices. The BI team works with various departments across Warner Music’s Central Functions, Recorded Music, & Music Publishing Divisions to understand the trends and dynamics that drive the constant evolution of our business. Our goal for this role is to strengthen our analytical power and bring improved rigor to the insights we deliver to our family of labels and operators. We work with partners across the company to establish best practices for breaking artists and sustaining catalog repertoire across consumption platforms, gauge the impact of marketing initiatives and campaigns, and work to understand user behavior around the world.

Your role:

Intelligence is the lifeblood of today’s music business, and in this role you’ll get a chance to apply your creativity and problem-solving skills to help our labels and artists connect with consumers across an array of media and mediums. Because the BI team works closely with departments across the company, you will have the opportunity to see the inner workings and decision-making within a global music company - and the ability to influence those decisions with thoughtful intelligence work. We’re a collaborative team that loves learning new things, sharing ideas, thinking about the future of the music industry – and helping our company get there.

Here you’ll get to:


Lead data science projects from inception to completion on topics such as consumption and revenue forecasts, digital advertising forecasts, global trends analysis, business performance trends, and more.
Apply advanced data analysis and statistical modeling techniques to address complex business challenges. Develop and maintain production-level models, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
Work closely with Business Intelligence, Strategy, Corporate Finance, and operators to understand business needs, and provide actionable insights to a diverse audience across the business.
Proactively identify areas where data science can add value by experimenting with different hypotheses and techniques to improve existing processes and techniques within the BI team.
Utilize advanced tools and frameworks for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
Promote and participate in a culture of continuous learning within the team by providing feedback, sharing knowledge, and mentoring more junior team members.


About you:


Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Data Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, or a related field.
1-3 years of full-time post-graduation experience in the music, entertainment, sports, or financial services industry. Candidates with a PhD can be considered for this level.
Experience and comfort in working with data from globally-trusted third-party sources like the UN, IMF, OECD, and World Bank.
Demonstrated ability to lead and execute data science projects with minimal supervision.
Proficiency in programming languages such as Python or R for data analysis and model development.
Experience with machine learning frameworks and statistical tools.
Strong understanding of SQL and working with large datasets.
Familiarity with data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI.
Expertise in fundamental data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling techniques.
Ability to quickly learn and adapt to new techniques and technologies.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to explain complex concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
Strong problem-solving abilities, with a bias towards action and a proactive approach to identifying opportunities and challenges.


We’d love it if you also had:


Familiarity with the streaming music landscape or other digital media
Experience building analytical products and dashboards within BI software like Tableau or other environments like Streamlit.

Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article.

As a Senior ML/AI Engineer, you will play a central role in our new AI R&D team, leading the charge in discovering and implementing innovative AI and ML solutions that add great value to our users and customers.

Your mission will be to spearhead our AI and ML innovation, and drive our continued experiments with ML models to explore opportunities. You will leverage your knowledge in Python and BigQuery (or other Data Warehouses), where you have gained a good grasp of statistics, and statistical models. You have a broad experience from developing and using different families of ML frameworks and models, and likely have experience from experimenting and building products using LLMs, public or locally hosted.

You will have the opportunity to work with our extensive datasets, comprising millions of property listings, continuously enriched by the user interactions from our 1.3 million daily visits. This vast and continuously growing data source will be your playground for driving AI and ML experiments, providing a unique and dynamic environment where you can thrive. Your ability to adeptly navigate the setting of a mid-sized tech company and manage PR-based workflows and large-scale systems will be crucial to your success.

In this role, you will not only investigate and experiment with different AI technologies, but also collaborate closely with the existing Data & ML Platform team, responsible for developing our Data Platform and MLOps. Your leadership and insight will be essential in guiding our AI initiatives, shaping their direction, and ensuring their success. Your past experience from one or more roles such as Data Scientist, ML Engineer, or AI Engineer will equip you with the skills needed to excel.

We are looking for someone curious, courageous, and collaborative, with a bit of YOLO spirit. You should be passionate about leveraging ML and AI to create meaningful impacts and enhance user experiences. This role offers significant freedom to shape it according to business needs and your background, making your contribution vital to Hemnet’s AI journey. Join us and be a part of a team that enjoys working together to explore and implement innovative solutions that will transform our industry.

What We Offer

Our office is located in the heart of Stockholm, where we meet weekly or as needed, with the flexibility to work from home as well. Enjoy 30 days of holiday plus 4 extra leave days (YOLO days), paid workouts, running classes/races, and flexible working hours. We provide comprehensive benefits to ensure you feel safe and supported, including pension benefits, parental leave top-up, and health insurance. Here’s our full benefit package 👈.

Do you like to create insights and turn them into action to create lasting impact? We are searching for an experienced Data Scientist for our Data & AI team to support our clients by combining business sense with data modelling. If this description fits your profile, we are looking for you!

The Data & AI team at IG&H is using the latest data and AI technology to help our clients innovate. To do so, our team of 25 data experts works closely together with our Technology and Sector teams. Through smart collaboration, we have delivered over 40 (Gen)AI projects in the last two years for our clients in Retail, Healthcare and Financial Services. As a Data Scientist, you will play a central role in truly understanding our client’s needs, translating this into value, creating solutions, developing Gen(AI) models and turning them into action. We believe it is key to have business sense as well as broad experience with data related topics (analytics, artificial intelligence, etc.) to create real business value. On top of that, you need to be able to communicate clearly and convincingly. Not only for effective project execution, but also to inspire (internal) stakeholders on the latest trends and developments in the field of Data and AI.

You will typically work in multidisciplinary project teams for one project at a time. Although being able to deliver work independently is appreciated, involvement of a project manager and technical experts ensures high-quality delivery and facilitates you to maintain a steep learning curve. We believe in diverse teams and diverse profiles in our Data & AI team. Some of our Data Scientists develop to be great consultants with technical knowledge and execution power, while others focus more on gaining deep technical expertise to deliver value from there. Working on a different range of projects in different sectors, you’ll be able to find your own sweet spot.

In addition, we believe that a caring and fun working environment will help you to dare to step out of your comfort zone and learn. We offer continuous learning through the IG&H Academy, in which you will get trainings to boost your data science, consulting and people skills. Also, you will be assigned a mentor, who will be there for you to provide you with guidance.

Above all, people are at the heart of what we do. This of course comes back in the work we deliver for our clients (why make a data product if the people who need to use it do not understand or want to use it?). At the same time, a fun working culture is key for who we are. With an inspiring office in Utrecht where we can connect, have abundant parties, team activities and sport events (both organized for the entire IG&H organization as well as specifically for the Data & Analytics team), IG&H is truly a Great Place To Work. And yes, we are certified!

Working for the Data & AI Team at IG&H Consulting is incredibly diverse, and fun at the same time. It’s been a great place to develop my technical know-how, management consulting skills and commercial effectivity. The team is young and ambitious, with a strong desire to solve complex puzzles, develop personally & professionally and do fun activities together. All in all, IG&H has been a great place to work for over 6 years already!

We are a key innovation partner for iconic and emerging brands across the world.

Our Platform is able to analyze the info of more than 1.000 retailers, processing data from more than 600.000 brands, tracking millions of products!

The Data Science team is responsible for enriching the data that our crawlers collect massively from fashion related websites with our own machine learning models. Our models add information to the existing products such as the categories (clothing, footwear, beauty…), genders, attributes, colors, bounding boxes, etc. The database already contains more than 500 millions of products (growing daily) and we process 1-2M new products every week.

To do that, you will use the latest and best open-source technologies out there. We code in Python (and we love it, you may want to come to the PyCon Spain conference with us!), using Keras as our main Deep Learning framework (although we are starting using Pytorch for certain projects) along with the other machine learning and computer vision libraries like scikit-learn or OpenCV.

In the engineering side, we use Django as our main framework for accessing the data. We are a cloud-native company, so our code runs in AWS. Our massive amount of data lives in PostgreSQL databases and we keep an eye on all this using observability tools like Grafana, Influxdb and Telegraf.

If you do not know a lot about some of those technologies, worry not, our engineers will be happy to support you while you are on your journey to becoming an expert in them.

Your Job

We are seeking a highly skilled and innovative Data Scientist to join our team and contribute to the research and implementation of cutting-edge Large Language Models for analyzing and give insights from our raw data and reports in the fashion retail industry. The ideal candidate will have a strong background in machine learning, deep learning, and NLP, with a particular focus on generative models.

Your Skills


3+ years of experience working as a software engineer.
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related field
3+ years of experience as a production level Python developer and Deep learning frameworks: Tensorflow, Keras or Pytorch
Machine learning and Python data libraries like scikit-learn, pandas or numpy
Experience with NLP (Natural Language Processing)
Experience with LLMs: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), LangChain, Prompt Engineering, etc



Bonus Points

Additionally, it would be nice if you are familiar with:
