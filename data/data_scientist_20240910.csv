Soils are the unsung hero in the fight against climate change. With your help we want to uncover and use this secret. As data engineer at Seqana you will acquire and harmonize data on soils to unlock the potential of soil carbon sequestration for climate protection.

About Seqana:

Seqana is an EU- and venture-backed start-up building monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) tools to drive soil carbon sequestration and the transition towards regenerative and climate-preserving agriculture.

One of the most powerful (and underutilized) solutions to climate change is capturing carbon in soils via regenerative agricultural practices. This approach has the potential for several times more climate impact than planting forests, while also providing extensive co-benefits such as erosion mitigation and improved water quality, food security, and biodiversity.

Existing solutions for MRV for the carbon market are one of the main drivers of cost and effort, and often the limiting factor for new project development. At Seqana, we combine satellite imagery, our extensive proprietary library of soil datasets, and machine learning to provide an accurate, cost-effective, and efficient MRV solution for soil organic carbon. Our product enables project developers, large corporations and NGOS with a scalable solution to measure and quantify the impact of their regenerative agricultural practices on soil carbon sequestration, enabling them to report credible CO2 reductions.

Tasks

Our growing team is looking for an ambitious and driven soil data scientist to help us quantify soil organic carbon and its sequestration by using better data. You will play a crucial part in ensuring and improving the quality of soil data we work with, and the accuracy of the statistical models derived from it. Your work will directly contribute to the advancement of our MRV and sampling tools, helping to drive effective climate solutions through innovative technology.

We're looking for someone who brings a deep understanding in soil science, an analytical mindset, and data science skills. You will be part of a passionate team that aims to have a direct positive impact on the world. We value proactivity, authenticity, creativity, and empathy in our company culture.

Impact you’ll own:


Manage the onboarding of new datasets and implement rigorous data quality processes
Apply a soil science perspective and ensure that our data pipelines and modeling approaches are grounded in a deep understanding of soil processes and dynamics
Standardize our data discovery, acquisition, and harmonization processes
Develop analytical data models and dashboards to serve the needs of insights and analytics
Collaborate with stakeholders across the company to constantly optimize the data infrastructure and associated processes



Requirements

What you bring:


A track record of research in soil science, particularly in SOC and its implications for climate change and agricultural land management
2-4 years of experience in data science roles or equivalent, with a strong foundation in statistical analysis
Proficiency in Python and SQL - with experience in automating data processing and conducting data analyses
Experience with soil sampling methods, laboratory analysis techniques, and understanding of SOC measurement best practices and standards
Ability to work and communicate effectively in an agile, fast-paced startup environment
A proactive, can-do attitude with the ability to quickly adapt, learn, and embrace change
Passion for environmental sustainability and climate tech



What makes you stand out:


Bonus: Knowledge of leading voluntary carbon standards and methodologies, e.g. VCS, Gold Standard or CAR
Bonus: Experience in carbon statistical modeling or process-based models such as Century, RothC, or DNDC
Bonus: Experience with machine learning, including model training and evaluation, is a big plus



Benefits

Benefits you can expect:


Be part of our highly motivated, committed, and international team with flat hierarchies that is working on solving one of societies’ biggest challenges: Climate Change
Witness and shape the evolution of a new business being built
Collaborative DevOps culture with opportunities for continuous learning and improvement
Work in a casual environment with flexible hours and some ability to work from home
Competitive salary, benefits, and compensation package
Drinks, snacks, team events, and your choice of hardware



Seqana is committed to building a workplace culture based on the values of proactivity, authenticity, creativity, and empathy, where equal employment opportunity is guaranteed to all applicants and team members regardless of their race, color, ethnicity, sex, sexual identity, religion, or disability.

Data Engineer - MLOps Focus

Berlin based - m/f/d - full-time

What We Do At Plato

Plato is building the digital backbone of the global trade economy. Starting with the $48T wholesale industry, we empower the modern wholesaler to connect their people and data in a single analytics and workflow hub. By leveraging data science and AI, we automate workflows and combat labor shortages, making SMB wholesalers competitive with large corporations.

Why We Do What We Do

The future of wholesale is data-driven. Unlike popular opinion, Industrial SMEs are ready to make the step to become more proactive in their processes but lack the technology to steer them to success. Our founders come from a wholesale family and gathered a rock star team of ex-Big Tech, VC, and top-tier consulting companies to reshape the operations of this $48tn industry. Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.

What We’re Looking For

MLOps = DataOps + DevOps + ModelOps

At Plato, we are building a real-time data platform. As a member of our team, you will play a pivotal role in developing and maintaining the infrastructure that powers our ML solutions.

A significant challenge we face is onboarding a large number of customers onto our platform, where automation and repeatability are crucial for success. This role combines the best of data engineering with the demands of machine learning operations, ensuring the seamless operation of data pipelines and ML models from development to production.

The ideal candidate is an innovative problem-solver who is passionate about both data engineering and MLOps. You will thrive in our dynamic startup environment, wearing multiple hats when required to meet our evolving needs. Your ability to collaborate across teams, automate processes, and ensure repeatability will be key to driving our data and ML infrastructure forward.

What You’d Be Working On


Design, develop, and manage scalable and robust data pipelines that support machine learning models in production.
Implement and maintain CI/CD pipelines for data and ML workflows, ensuring smooth transitions from development to production.
Automate the onboarding process for new customers, ensuring scalability and repeatability across deployments.
Collaborate with data scientists and AI Engineers to optimize and automate data processing and model deployment.
Ensure the seamless integration of ML models with production environments, enabling real-time and batch inference capabilities.
Develop and maintain tools and frameworks for automated data management, model retraining, and monitoring.
Utilize MLFlow for model tracking, versioning, and lifecycle management.
Implement model serving solutions to deploy and manage real-time inference pipelines.
Work closely with our product, engineering, and data science teams to build and maintain a data platform that scales with our growing customer base.
Establish and enforce best practices for data and ML pipeline versioning, experimentation, and reproducibility.



What You Bring Along


3+ years of experience in data engineering, ML Engineering or a related field, with a strong focus on MLOps.

About Merchant Group at Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business. Their core mission is to provide merchants with self-service tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use.

About The Merchant Analytics Team

Merchant Analytics is an embedded analytics function within the Merchant Group. The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

We’re for those who want a little more substance from style, more guidance and expertise - less rules and less routine. Because we believe that style is an unfolding story. We aim to inspire and empower - not dictate what to wear. We understand that style is a journey, and we’re here to guide the way. Every customer gets a personal selection of clothes, which our stylists create out of more than 100 brands - always considering their wishes and budget. Our customers only pay for what they keep. Our mission is to empower anyone to unlock their true style.

In your role as Software Engineer - Machine Learning (all genders) at OUTFITTERY you will be responsible for implementing, deploying, monitoring and maintaining the infrastructure and software to enable Machine Learning (ML) solutions, e.g., in the area of fashion AI, recommendation systems, and others across all business domains. Together with the data science and engineering teams, you will implement best practices to improve our existing AI/ML infrastructure focusing on stability, efficiency, and scalability. You will apply your end-to-end understanding of ML applications and data product design. All of this in a diverse and international team. You will join a data team of eight data engineers, analysts and scientists who work closely with different units to solve business problems at hand.

Your Tasks


Manage and maintain ML microservices for tasks like fashion recommendations, article filtering, and dataset composition.
Monitor, modify, and improve the software components of these services, including postprocessing algorithms for ML scores, flask endpoints serving the algorithms, deployment processes for services.
Work closely with data scientists on shaping our data driven applications through their entire lifecycle – from ideation and specification, architectural design, prototyping, testing, deployment and integration into productive systems.
Define and follow development and testing standards as well as automate CI/CD related processes.
Communicating design and implementation to colleagues and senior management in verbal, visual, and written media.
Collaborate with teams across the company, e.g., IT, Product, Marketing, Sales, and Finance & Risk.


Your Profile


Ideally, a graduate or postgraduate Degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Physics, or a similar field.
Hands-on experience with integrating large-scale AI systems into production environments is a plus.
Strong experience in developing highly reliable, efficient and scalable solutions with Python.
Experience with both relational (Postgres) and non-relational (Elastic/OpenSearch) database engines, or similar technologies. Experience with comparable database systems is also valuable.
Solid understanding of MLOps practices and tools, including orchestration (Airflow), CI/CD (GitHub Actions), application/model deployment (Flask/FastAPI), and monitoring (Kibana/Instana). Experience with similar tools is also considered valuable.
Experience in applying software engineering practices such as automated testing, code reviews and clean code design patterns.
Experience with cloud platforms (AWS), Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Cloudformation) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).
Fluency in English, German is a plus.

About the Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has got Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Develop and automate forecasting models to plan the capacity of the support centers across different locations.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track scheduling efficiency, occupancy rates, and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building forecasting models & time series analysis (Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters or similar).
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in Cost Analysis, What-if Scenario Analysis, Capacity planning, and Workforce Management is nice to have but not mandatory.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me.

At Doctolib, we're on a mission to transform the way healthcare is delivered by leveraging the power of AI. You can play a key role in developing and implementing cutting-edge AI models that power our AI phone assistant for medical practices. The phone assistant allows patients to make, reschedule, or cancel appointments via phone without long hold times, providing more flexibility and around-the-clock access to healthcare services. It addresses a significant challenge in the healthcare sector: managing the high volume of telephone calls in order to improve the efficiency of healthcare professionals in their daily tasks.

As a Senior Data Scientist, you will enhance Doctolib’s phone assistant by improving speech-to-text accuracy through fine-tuning while ensuring low latency. You will improve user experience by adapting to her emotions in real time and reducing dropout rates by making the conversation feel ever more smooth, seamless and natural. You will also ensure safety by implementing guardrails that catch prediction errors before they happen, or mitigate their impact. The phone assistant will be the playground where you can do your best work and stay at the edge of innovation.

Your responsibilities include, but are not limited to:


Creating, finding or adapting model architecture.
Designing the right annotation and data collection strategy
Implementing and putting new ideas to the test to improve model performance and ultimately user experience.
Running offline model evaluation for various types of models with different metrics.
Deploying algorithms in production using our state of the art ML platform
Measuring online performance and continuously refine your approach.



Who You Are

You could be our next team mate if you:


Have a Master's or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Statistics, Mathematics, or a related quantitative field.
Have at least 5 years of experience in the domain.
Have significant experience with speech-to-text.
Have experience with NLP techniques and tools, which is particularly relevant for voice recognition and automation tasks.
Have experience working with Large Language Models.
Have knowledge of the latest NLP architecture (Transformer, LLM) and methods (fine tuning, distillation…)
Are proficient in German.



Now, it would be fantastic if you:


Have experience in deploying and scaling NLP solutions.
Have experience with text-to-speech models and large multimodal models.
Have made significant contributions (papers, open source) in the domain.
Being proficient in French is a plus.

Why bet on Computer Vision and Safari AI?


Huge opportunity hiding in plain sight: leveraging already-installed cameras to automate and real-time action on operational data
Large chasm between customer knowledge and market availability, i.e. customers don't know what is available in the market...yet.
No clear industry leader in computer vision; everyone is small and unbranded (i.e. no Amazon or Google in the room to compete with)
Very modular, allowing Safari AI and its customers to invent whole new use cases on a regular basis
