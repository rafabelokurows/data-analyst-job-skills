At Warner Music Group, we’re a global collective of music makers and music lovers, tech innovators and inspired entrepreneurs, game-changing creatives and passionate team members. Here, we know that each talent makes our collective bolder and brighter. We are guided by four core principles that underpin everything we do across all our diverse businesses:


Music is Everything: Music is our passion, and we can never get enough. Tastes, trends, and tech will change, but great artists and songwriters will always be our driving force.
Global Growth, Local Expertise: Music is a global language. Through communication and collaboration, our success can come from anywhere and translate everywhere.
Innovation and Insight: Pushing the boundaries requires the best information and the boldest imagination. We use both to create the future.
Empowered by People: Like the artists we serve and the music they make, our differences make us stronger. This is a place where every talent can belong and build a career.


We remain committed to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We know it fosters a culture where you can truly belong, contribute, and grow. We encourage applications from people of any age, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion, ethnicity, disability, veteran status, and any other characteristic or identity.

Consider a career at WMG and get the best of both worlds – an innovative global music company that retains the creative spirit of a nimble independent.

A little bit about our team:

WMG’s Business Intelligence team (BI) works to influence WMG’s strategy and day-to-day operations by developing thoughtful insights & intelligence from its core business practices. The BI team works with various departments across Warner Music’s Central Functions, Recorded Music, & Music Publishing Divisions to understand the trends and dynamics that drive the constant evolution of our business. Our goal for this role is to strengthen our analytical power and bring improved rigor to the insights we deliver to our family of labels and operators. We work with partners across the company to establish best practices for breaking artists and sustaining catalog repertoire across consumption platforms, gauge the impact of marketing initiatives and campaigns, and work to understand user behavior around the world.

Your role:

Intelligence is the lifeblood of today’s music business, and in this role you’ll get a chance to apply your creativity and problem-solving skills to help our labels and artists connect with consumers across an array of media and mediums. Because the BI team works closely with departments across the company, you will have the opportunity to see the inner workings and decision-making within a global music company - and the ability to influence those decisions with thoughtful intelligence work. We’re a collaborative team that loves learning new things, sharing ideas, thinking about the future of the music industry – and helping our company get there.

Here you’ll get to:


Lead data science projects from inception to completion on topics such as consumption and revenue forecasts, digital advertising forecasts, global trends analysis, business performance trends, and more.
Apply advanced data analysis and statistical modeling techniques to address complex business challenges. Develop and maintain production-level models, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
Work closely with Business Intelligence, Strategy, Corporate Finance, and operators to understand business needs, and provide actionable insights to a diverse audience across the business.
Proactively identify areas where data science can add value by experimenting with different hypotheses and techniques to improve existing processes and techniques within the BI team.
Utilize advanced tools and frameworks for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
Promote and participate in a culture of continuous learning within the team by providing feedback, sharing knowledge, and mentoring more junior team members.


About you:


Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Data Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, or a related field.
1-3 years of full-time post-graduation experience in the music, entertainment, sports, or financial services industry. Candidates with a PhD can be considered for this level.
Experience and comfort in working with data from globally-trusted third-party sources like the UN, IMF, OECD, and World Bank.
Demonstrated ability to lead and execute data science projects with minimal supervision.
Proficiency in programming languages such as Python or R for data analysis and model development.
Experience with machine learning frameworks and statistical tools.
Strong understanding of SQL and working with large datasets.
Familiarity with data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI.
Expertise in fundamental data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling techniques.
Ability to quickly learn and adapt to new techniques and technologies.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to explain complex concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
Strong problem-solving abilities, with a bias towards action and a proactive approach to identifying opportunities and challenges.


We’d love it if you also had:


Familiarity with the streaming music landscape or other digital media
Experience building analytical products and dashboards within BI software like Tableau or other environments like Streamlit.

We're on a mission to transform spoken communication for individuals, teams and organizations of any size. Meetings may be our most information rich channel for work, but suffer from a lack of structure and documentation. At Supernormal, we're solving this problem with focus, design and craft.

We've been working on this since 2019 and have customers like Snap, Salesforce, Replay, Gitcoin, Pinterest and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we are growing rapidly and are excited for new teammates to join who are the best at what they do. We're passionately building a team that is as diverse and creative as the millions of people we serve worldwide.

Supernormal is a remote first company and does not require co-location. We have annual team retreats and gather several times a quarter.

About The Role

Machine learning engineers at Supernormal build the AI that superpowers the core product experience for people's meetings including transcription, note generation, and task automation. The AI team builds reliable and secure services that use the most advanced AI models in the market to generate millions of high-quality meeting notes to a rapidly growing customer base. Our work revolves heavily around software engineering, too - we are looking for people with a drive to roll up their sleeves and get new models and features out to users as quickly as possible.

What You'll Work On

As an ML engineer on Supernormal's AI team, you will be responsible for the end-to-end development of our AI solutions for meeting notes, question answering, and task completion. Your work will encompass LLM API calls, custom model training and deployment, speech recognition, quality evaluation and fixes, retrieval augmented generation, and much more. You'll play a key role in optimizing for cost, latency, and quality. Some of the projects you'll work on include:


Prompt engineering using state-of-the-art techniques to improve the core meeting assistant scenarios
Building and shipping custom machine learning models to augment the AI stack, including improving transcript quality, reducing tokens sent to APIs, removing defects in LLM output, and extracting semi-structured data
Training and deploying custom large language models from open source using state-of-the-art techniques (LoRA, RLHF, instruction-tuning, etc) and fine tuning foundation models for a variety of business purposes
Developing new product experiences using NLP & LLMs that get better based on user feedback & iteration while collaborating with product engineers & design team
Defining and improving business & product metrics to optimize the quality and cost of AI usage
Improving LLM-powered search and question answering (using RAG) over sets of meetings
Advocating for, and building, new and better ways of doing things. You'll leave everything you touch just a bit better than you found it



Requirements

What you will bring

We are a fast-moving startup building zero-to-one products on top of large language models. The ideal candidate has a strong machine learning background and a hacker mindset, someone who can both spin up Jupyter Notebooks to train models and also excel at writing solid, fast production code for deployment.


AI/ML Experience: Demonstrated proficiency in AI/ML with a track record of at least 3-5 years experience building machine learning systems, up to speed on the latest in NLP & LLMs, and proficient in data curation, modeling, and training models. We require skills for shipping and maintaining ML in production settings
A Solid Educational Foundation: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, AI, Mathematics, or related field; Master's degree or PhD a plus
Versatile Software Engineering Skills: A solid engineering background with a robust foundation in software engineering principles. You have written code for and supported production engineering systems.
Proficient in Python and SQL: our AI stack uses Python & PyTorch and interfaces with Ruby on Rails (bonus if you know it, but not required) and we write a lot of SQL queries on top of Snowflake to pull data


What we'll expect of you


A collaborative and open outlook — we're all about lifting each other up and getting better every day
A willingness to get deep into a problem even when it seems impossible. You'll always have support from the team
Confidence operating with high agency. We'll work together to decide what's important, but we'd love for you to bring (and build!) your own ideas
You'll come in willing to learn why things are the way they are, then suggest a better way
You'll understand that there's no difference between ""my idea"" and ""their idea."" It's our ideas and we're all responsible for it
You'll approach speed bumps and reviews through a ""how can the team level up?"" lens — let's all get better and learn, together


What you can expect from us


We're a fully distributed team spread between Pacific Time (California) and Central European Time (Stockholm) with lots of places in between. We'll see you most days in Slack, Google Meet, GitHub issues, and Notion. Sometimes in person in a place with a warm breeze
We're a friendly bunch and are happy to pair, talk through, or otherwise assist any time
Honest and timely feedback. We're all better when we can have candid conversations about what is and isn't working
A willingness to listen to your ideas: how can the codebase, our product, or team be better?
A respect for your time outside of work. We all work hard here, but we never forget to rest and have fun

Onze ambitie is een high performance en een digital first organisatie te worden. We kunnen je hierdoor een inhoudelijk uitdagende rol bieden. Werken voor Olympia, dat betekent dit voor jou:




Voel je gewaardeerd in een omgeving waar iedereen welkom is
Maak, samen met ons, werk van je persoonlijke groei en ontwikkeling
Haal energie uit onze unieke ‘wij-maken-het-waar’ cultuur
Haal persoonlijke en maatschappelijke betekenis uit werk




En verder bieden we je uiteraard:




Een dienstverband van 36 of 40 uur per week. Jij bepaalt wat het beste bij je past.
Een passend salaris tussen € 3.350 en € 4.794, afhankelijk van kennis en ervaring.
Bovengemiddeld veel vakantiedagen, 32,5 verlofdagen bij een 40-urige werkweek.
Onkostenvergoeding van €105,- netto per maand bij een 40-urige werkweek.
Een mooie bonus aan het einde van het jaar.
Aantrekkelijke secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een gunstige pensioenregeling en korting op verzekeringen.
Volledige reiskostenvergoeding op basis van al het openbaar vervoer of een kilometervergoeding vanaf 10 km (€ 23 ct.).
Een laptop en smartphone om je werk goed te kunnen uitvoeren.
8% vakantietoeslag.
Bij Olympia geven we onze collega’s de mogelijkheid om drie officiële feestdagen per jaar om te ruilen voor een andere culturele of religieuze dag die voor hen belangrijk is.
Het hybride werken met de juiste balans van werken op kantoor en vanuit huis.
Een inspirerende, moderne en bovenal duurzame werkplek. Wij zijn gevestigd in het Pharos-gebouw tegenover station Hoofddorp.
Opleidingsmogelijkheden die passen bij jouw ontwikkeldoelen.
Eens per jaar een “Dag van betekenis”. Een vrije dag die je volledig zelf invult om iets te doen wat veel voor je betekent.

Experience in building and deploying production-ready ML models at scale, and solid data engineering skills (e.g. experience with cloud technologies - we use GCP but experience with AWS or Azure will also be fine)
Ability in Python and SQL for data manipulation, modeling, and scripting
Experience in working with large datasets, ideally from tech platforms, e-commerce, or SaaS-type businesses. Knowledge of behavioral data, detecting misbehavior or fraud at scale is a big plus
Knowledge of data pipelining and prior experience with cloud-based ML model deployments
Great communication skills - both with technical colleagues and with business stakeholders
Proven 3+ years of technical experience in a Data Science role, particularly in the technology sector or in a technical consultancy


What's In It For You


A range of flexible working options to dedicate time to what matters to you
Competitive compensation package + bonus
25 days holiday per year, with an extra 5 days holiday allocated after your 1 year anniversary (prorated)
Two (paid) volunteering days a year to spend your time giving back to the causes that matter to you and your community

We are a key innovation partner for iconic and emerging brands across the world.

Our Platform is able to analyze the info of more than 1.000 retailers, processing data from more than 600.000 brands, tracking millions of products!

The Data Science team is responsible for enriching the data that our crawlers collect massively from fashion related websites with our own machine learning models. Our models add information to the existing products such as the categories (clothing, footwear, beauty…), genders, attributes, colors, bounding boxes, etc. The database already contains more than 500 millions of products (growing daily) and we process 1-2M new products every week.

To do that, you will use the latest and best open-source technologies out there. We code in Python (and we love it, you may want to come to the PyCon Spain conference with us!), using Keras as our main Deep Learning framework (although we are starting using Pytorch for certain projects) along with the other machine learning and computer vision libraries like scikit-learn or OpenCV.

In the engineering side, we use Django as our main framework for accessing the data. We are a cloud-native company, so our code runs in AWS. Our massive amount of data lives in PostgreSQL databases and we keep an eye on all this using observability tools like Grafana, Influxdb and Telegraf.

If you do not know a lot about some of those technologies, worry not, our engineers will be happy to support you while you are on your journey to becoming an expert in them.

Your Job

We are seeking a highly skilled and innovative Data Scientist to join our team and contribute to the research and implementation of cutting-edge Large Language Models for analyzing and give insights from our raw data and reports in the fashion retail industry.

We are the leading one-stop-shop for branded payments, making online recharge possible for anyone, anywhere at any time — whether you or someone you love needs credit for calling, gaming, entertainment or money. This is your chance to join an ambitious scaleup in a state of rapid growth; we’ll push you to develop yourself and help you create a real impact in your role. Put simply: we could write history together.

We won’t bore you with a corporate spiel about how we might be taking on the world of branded payments (spoiler: we are). Instead, we’ll let the numbers speak for themselves: we bring consumers their favourite brands to their fingertips, with over 15,000 products available in every gift card category globally, $70 million in funding (and counting!), 20%+ growth in 2023. We also have a revenue target of €75 million in 2024, we're just getting started with 1.1 million app downloads in 2023, we are counting 5.0+ million active customers, a presence in 180 countries and 25 markets, a team of 150+ employees and 35+ nationalities, and 1 person missing — you.

We’re on the hunt for the hungriest and most passionate talent out there. If at any point your brain screams “I want in!” while you’re reading this, then consider this the sign you’ve been looking for: we want you too.

The role

We’re looking for a talented Data Scientist to join our Business Intelligence Team reporting to Nicolas Arrivé. You will work on improving our day to day business operations. You understand what kind of insights drive the right action. You have great analytical skills and are good at making people understand what needs to get done and why.

The BI team embeds actionable insights into the business teams, and drives commercial success (improving sales, margin and/or efficiency). Automation is also at the heart of our business practices when value can be extracted at scale.

What will I do?

As a Data Scientist you will play a vital part in defining our company strategy and execution across Payment flow, Paid Marketing, Customer base and product strategy.

You are part of the Business Intelligence team and you are the technical expert in modelling, testing and analytical techniques helping us analysing millions of consumer transactions.

You are modelling from scratch or improving existing statistical models aiming (among other things) at: predicting and explaining Churn, predicting and explaining next likely brand/transaction to happen, existing Marketing Mix Models, automating anomaly detection, existing Lifetime Value prediction model and many more core operational predictive processes. You can articulate the pros and cons of a given approach to numerous stakeholders.

You perform ad hoc advanced strategic analyses and turn these into KPIs that are relevant and easy to understand.

You are a de-facto code reviewer for the rest of the team for the code base you are the most proficient with.

• Apply chemical and mechanical principles to investigate and optimize formulations

• Work closely with engineering, process, and analytical teams

• Communicate findings internally

• Written: clear plans and reports for R&D programs

• In small groups: productive and collaborative discussions

• Department- and company-wide: focused presentations

• Be accountable for, and complete and accurate with data, communication, and

timelines

• Help discover and develop novel approaches to control drug release and gastric

residence

We are building new types of longitudinal datasets that have foundations of RWD sources, such as EHRs (electronic health records) and claims data, and are augmented with prospective data collection. You will develop and deploy models that enable scalable curation of RWD. This will include multi-source integrations and reconciliations, creating derived features from the source data (e.g., abstraction of clinical concepts from unstructured data), and facilitating data quality assessments. You will work with a diverse cross-functional team to build reusable and scalable tools and to deliver products that unlock information from structured and unstructured clinical data.

Responsibilities


Work closely with cross-functional partners to design and create longitudinal datasets integrating multiple data sources.
Build and implement highly accurate machine learning models / AI tools using sparsely labeled healthcare datasets.
Implement, build on and augment existing LLM/NLP tools to maximize the value of using unstructured medical data across a range of research and care applications.
Become an expert in our data’s capabilities and limitations. Solve difficult, non-routine analysis problems, handling data challenges from a real-world setting.
Communicate technical methods and results clearly in well structured reports and presentations to a range of technical and non-technical audiences.


Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications


Advanced degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., data sciences, statistics, biomedical informatics, computer science, applied mathematics, or similar), or equivalent practical experience.
2+ years experience applying advanced machine learning and AI techniques (supervised and unsupervised methods, LLMs, NLP) to clinical data.
Direct experience working with and curating real-world data, such as EHR, including a deep understanding of the complexities of this structured and unstructured clinical data.
Strong proficiency in Python.


Preferred Qualifications


Familiarity with medical terminologies and ontologies.
Familiarity with software engineering practices and experience developing production software.
Experience working with clinical subject matter experts.
Ability to work cross-functionally on teams, with a tolerance for ambiguity.
Creative and methodical problem solving: understand needs, identify options, form hypotheses, generate robust results, make informed decisions, and learn faster through feedback.
