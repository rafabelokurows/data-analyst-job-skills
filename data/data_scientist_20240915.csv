We vouch to create a space where you can explore different sets of complex problems and data across industries and verticals.
To support you in your personal development, everyone at Kineo has a mentor. When you grow, so does Kineo.
Your decisions matter! You will not have a boss who decides things for you. At Kineo we believe that decisions are best made locally, by the people closest to the problem at hand.
Transparent salary and career planning from day one.
A beautiful office in the centre of Kreuzberg, with tons of benefits, such as free drinks, snacks, consoles etc.

You enjoy exploring beyond your immediate tasks and are open to learning new skills. You collaborate across different areas to help the team succeed, even in areas outside your main expertise.
You are a strong communicator with the ability to present ideas clearly and collaborate effectively. You value building positive relationships and working together to achieve shared goals.

Experience in using a wide range of ML frameworks such as SKLearn, Tensorflow, Torch in production. Experience with domain specific libraries like OpenCV, HuggingFace etc are an advantage.
Good written and verbal communication in both English and German. Most of our clients are German speaking so a level of at least B2 is required for the role.
Resident in Germany. Due to the size of the company, we cannot currently accept applications from other EU/non-EU countries.



We explicitly do not hire anyone who discriminates against people on the basis of religion, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status or other aspects. We encourage people from LGBTQIA+ and other underrepresented groups to apply.

Last but not least, keep in mind that we are hiring value based, not skill based. That being said, please tell us the following in your contact message:

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

About The Consumer Data Science Team

Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists (Analytics) and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering team who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience that requires a good mix of technical and stakeholder engagement skills. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics or data science role. Data Scientists at Wolt take ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we're looking for someone like you.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland and Sweden. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
4+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent for product development (preferably consumer-facing).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

At Doctolib, we're on a mission to transform the way healthcare is delivered by leveraging the power of AI.

About Merchant Group at Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business. Their core mission is to provide merchants with self-service tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use.

About The Merchant Analytics Team

Merchant Analytics is an embedded analytics function within the Merchant Group. The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.<br><br>The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.<br><br><strong>Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion<br><br></strong>We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.<br><br>Join us today to build Wolt together!<br><br>

What We Do At Plato

Plato is building the digital backbone of the global trade economy. Starting with the $48T wholesale industry, we empower the modern wholesaler to connect their people and data in a single analytics and workflow hub. By leveraging data science and AI, we automate workflows and combat labor shortages, making SMB wholesalers competitive with large corporations.

Why We Do What We Do

The future of wholesale is data-driven. Unlike popular opinion, Industrial SMEs are ready to make the step to become more proactive in their processes but lack the technology to steer them to success. Our founders come from a wholesale family and gathered a rock star team of ex-Big Tech, VC, and top-tier consulting companies to reshape the operations of this $48tn industry. Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.

We're making Africa the first cashless continent.

In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.

We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.

Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in.....

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.

Develop and automate forecasting models to plan the capacity of the support centers across different locations.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track scheduling efficiency, occupancy rates, and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building forecasting models & time series analysis (Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters or similar).
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in Cost Analysis, What-if Scenario Analysis, Capacity planning, and Workforce Management is nice to have but not mandatory.

What We Do At Plato

Plato is building the digital backbone of the global trade economy. Starting with the $48T wholesale industry, we empower the modern wholesaler to connect their people and data in a single analytics and workflow hub. By leveraging data science and AI, we automate workflows and combat labor shortages, making SMB wholesalers competitive with large corporations.

Why We Do What We Do

The future of wholesale is data-driven. Unlike popular opinion, Industrial SMEs are ready to make the step to become more proactive in their processes but lack the technology to steer them to success. Our founders come from a wholesale family and gathered a rock star team of ex-Big Tech, VC, and top-tier consulting companies to reshape the operations of this $48tn industry. Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.

AI is transforming everything, and we make sure the right people are ahead of the curve. We do so by creating AI breakthroughs with our clients.




For us, creating breakthroughs is an irresistible adventure that we want to do 1000 times over. That’s why we are called One Thousand. And as a profitable, fast-growing company, we are on track as never before!




To create AI breakthroughs, our team of 15 friendly nerds identifies pain points and solves them with fast-paced MVPs. And: We enable the broader transformation of our clients into an AI powerhouse.




If you are keen to help Europe finally speed up in AI and would love to have warm outliers around you, join us now! We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer (m/w/d) who identifies with most of the following:




What we care about

Inherent Drive for Greatness: Our world-class team of outliers ships AI breakthroughs extremely fast while ensuring quality standards are met. We are people who feel like they still have something to prove – and we do so by working on something 1000x greater than us.
Relentless Resourcefulness: Creating AI breakthroughs requires the ability to thrive in uncertainty. We have the strength to bounce back and a tenacity to keep pushing to go where it hurts. We balance persistence with lightness.
Infectious Enthusiasm: We care about making AI a blast for everyone involved. With electrifying empathy, we propel our clients forward in understanding, building, and thriving with AI and boost our team with the opportunity to shape our future.




What the role is about

You will have the chance to shape fast-paced AI breakthrough projects. You will ensure our Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) are productionized as MVPs to generate business value.
You will be responsible for building data pipelines, running ML workflows, developing web services, deploying them on cloud environments, and supporting integration with our clients’ systems.

You bring experience with RDBMS (preferably PostgreSQL) and with at least one cloud platform (preferably, Microsoft Azure), too.
Being dedicated: You don't have to master everything, yet you fully support the team to reach our goals in a result-oriented way of working while fostering a culture of caring.
Dealing with ambiguity: Even if some challenges are vaguely defined, you make sense of what needs to be done.




Ideally, you also bring the following

Ability to communicate in German with level B2 or higher.
Experience with data science tools (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, ...).
Experience working with LLMs (OpenAI / Claude API).
Experience in building front-end solutions.

aignostics.com

Why us?
We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated.

That’s where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe’s largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $20M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Software Engineer for Machine Learning (d/f/m) at Aignostics, you work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art of machine learning for digital pathology. You will develop distributed software systems for machine learning applications that will help to improve cancer research and diagnostics. Together with your colleagues you will take care of the machine learning software stack and thereby enable our teams to build medical grade quality and scalable machine learning models. At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.

What you’ll do

As a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.

Responsibilities


Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


A Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2025, or equivalent work experience
Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts



Preferred Qualifications


One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$104,000 - C$156,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

More About Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the world’s best — and most fun — place to book travel. By leveraging massive amounts of data, advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to help customers spend less and travel better. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the app has been downloaded nearly 80 million times and continues to gain market share globally.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:


Hopper sold around $4 billion in travel and travel fintech in 2022, up nearly 3X over 2021. In 2022, Hopper increased its revenue 2.5X year-over year.
The company’s bespoke fintech products, such as Flight Disruption Guarantee and Price Freeze, now represent 30-40% of Hopper’s total app revenue.
Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud in late 2021. Through this partnership program, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory. As its first Hopper Cloud partnership,
Hopper partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders.
Recognized as one of the world’s most innovative companies by Fast Company four years in a row, Hopper has been downloaded over 80 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month.

Pipeline: Work with our ML Ops team to build cloud-based pipelines for large-scale image pre-processing, data-augmentation, training, post-processing, and inference.
Deploy: Work with the Software Development Team to deploy model in production for its end-users.
Monitor: Continuously monitor success matrices of the assigned ML project and make continuous improvements for increasing model robustness and efficiency.
Data Analysis: Work closely with our Data Analysts to explore, analyze, and organize data; perform data extraction and preprocessing for training and evaluation purposes.
Document: Document model architecture, training details, dataset extraction, and cleaning procedures for reproducibility, product management, and internal training.




Opportunities to Learn

Applying deep learning to real world industrial datasets containing billions of images.
Exploration of the state-of-the-art methodologies in computer vision like self-supervised learning and unsupervised learning for the purpose of non-destructive testing.

How We Work at Klue:


Hybrid Work. Our main Canadian hubs are in Vancouver and Toronto, and most of our Product, Design, and Engineering Teams are located in EST and PST. Ideally, this role would be located in Toronto or Vancouver. Your team will be in office at least 2 days per week, if you are within a reasonable commuting distance of the office, we’ll see you there!


Total compensation & benefits:


Time off. Take what you need. We want the team to prioritize wellness and avoid burnout. Vacation usually falls into 3 categories: recharging, life-event, & keeping a work-life balance. Just ensure the required work gets done and clear it with your team in advance. You need to take at least two weeks off every year. The average Klue team member takes 2-4 weeks of PTO per year.
Benefits start on day one!


⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️

Lastly, we take potential into consideration. An equivalent combination of education and experience may be accepted in lieu of the specifics listed above. If you know you have what it takes, even if that’s different from what we’ve described, be sure to explain why in your application. Reach out and let’s see if there is a home here for you now or in the future.

We’ve made a commitment to support and contribute to a diverse environment; on our teams and in our community. We’re early in our journey; we've started employee led resource groups, committed to Pay Up For Progress, and use success profiles for roles instead of 'years of experience'. We continue to scale our efforts as Klue grows. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and have dedicated that commitment to our current and future #kluecrew.

The existent datasets are large enough to benefit from sophisticated deep learning architectures, but small enough that ML models can be trained in a few days on a single GPU, facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation. Nevertheless, the current industry standard has progressed little beyond shallow ML techniques such as random forests and support vector machines, largely due to the difficulty of integrating world-class machine learning research with chemistry and pharmacology expertise.




Variational AI is searching for machine learning scientists to join us in our quest to radically accelerate the development of new drugs through machine learning excellence. Over the past five years, we have been advancing the state-of-the-art, and delivering projects to customers such as Merck. You will help us design, implement, test, and refine novel elements of a machine learning architecture built from the ground up to optimize the properties of small molecule drugs; continually improve the robustness of our existing code base; and apply our pipeline to new drug targets. We can provide all necessary background in chemistry, pharmacology, and biology.




Here is the background we’re looking for:

Ph.D. in CS, applied mathematics, statistics, physics, or related discipline;
Expertise with machine learning techniques, including diffusion models, Transformers, and Bayesian optimization, preferably demonstrated through first-author publications in conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML;
Two or more years’ experience developing robust code on larger projects, including code review, refactoring, unit testing, version control, etc.;
Mastery of Python and PyTorch; and
Intellectual curiosity and drive to excel.




We are an equal opportunity employer and enthusiastically welcome applications from women, BIPOC, and members of underrepresented communities and groups. Compensation is a competitive mix of cash and options. We prioritize expertise and passion over where you decide to live and work. Please send resumes/CVs to info@variational.ai.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team.

You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.

At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.

Your Role in the Revolution:

In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.

This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.

Who We're Looking For:

We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What You Will Be Doing


Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.
Drive Technical Projects: Take ownership of the entire development process, from gathering requirements to launching and iterating on products. You’ll work closely with stakeholders to ensure that our solutions meet learner needs and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
Collaborate and Communicate: Partner with a global team of developers, designers, and educational experts. Your ability to communicate complex ideas simply and effectively will be key to your success.
Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.


What You Won’t Be Doing


Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.

From designing our data models to implementing the subtle interaction behaviors that differentiate good software from great software. We work closely with UX Designers, Product Managers, and Data Scientists throughout the entire product process, from conception to post-launch reflection.

We are looking for a Software Engineer to join the Login & Signup (LNS) team in our Vancouver Office. The LNS team is responsible for handling the registration and authentication of Asana's users, with emphasis on secure login for enterprise accounts, such as single sign-on through Identity Providers (Okta, OneLogin, Google SSO, etc.) and multi-factor authentication. It is a full-stack team; tech stack includes TypeScript/React and some Scala.

In enterprise applications, user account management and login is a challenging, multi-faceted technical space encompassing software security, compliance to industry standards and legal regulations, large-scale IT administration needs, and quality of end-user experience. LNS' goal is to create and maintain a best-in-class registration and authentication system for Asana: we want it to be compliant with the most recent security standards and regulations, safe for enterprises to adopt, fully integrated with leading identity management frameworks, while offering the most delightful, smooth and seamless user experience.

You’ll advocate for engineering best practices and work cross-functionally to define and build powerful admin features while influencing the team's velocity. You'll mentor other engineers and advocate for code and component quality, reusability, and consistency; and you'll be at the forefront of a new wave of consumer-like experiences for the enterprise and enjoy the challenge of balancing speed of execution with quality and building a product that users love.

This role is based in Vancouver, with an office-centric hybrid schedule. The standard in-office days are Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Most Asanas have the option to work from home on Wednesdays. Working from home on Fridays depends on the type of work you do and the teams with which you partner. If you're interviewing for this role, your recruiter will share more about the in-office requirements.

What You’ll Achieve


Work in a high-performance, dynamic team with a strong focus on velocity and software quality and people's professional development
Contribute to building a complex SaaS application that is a market leader in its segment
Collaborate with Product Managers and customers to understand the needs of IT admins of large enterprises, and identify features to satisfy those needs
Partner with our Product Security team to stay updated about security threats, vulnerabilities, and cutting-edge countermeasures to protect SaaS applications
Learn about state-of-the-art technologies, including single-sign on methods and integration with Identity Providers such as Okta and Azure AD
Drive large, impactful projects, delivering features rolled out and used in large organizations


About You


Experience driving projects of medium complexity autonomously and reliably, planning tasks through milestones and workstreams, coordinating multiple engineers, and delivering successfully and on time
Interested in working in a highly technical space, learn about state of the art registration and authentication technologies, and software security
Passion for software architecture and software quality
Strong commitment to building the best UX to delight consumer and enterprise users
Continuous improvement mindset and a drive to enhance the architecture, the code, and team processes
Enthusiasm for mentoring and coaching teammates and stakeholders and contributing to team growth
Relevant experience in the tech stack (React, Typescript, Scala, SQL) as well as in UX design are nice-to-haves
Relevant industry experience in authorization and software security is a big plus; if you hold this experience, make sure to emphasize it in your application


At Asana, we're committed to building teams that include a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, as this is critical to helping us achieve our mission. If you're interested in this role and don't meet every listed requirement, we still encourage you to apply.

What We’ll Offer

Our comprehensive compensation package plays a big part in how we recognize you for the impact you have on our path to achieving our mission. We believe that compensation should be reflective of the value you create relative to the market value of your role. To ensure pay is fair and not impacted by biases, we're committed to looking at market value which is why we check ourselves and conduct a yearly pay equity audit.

For this role, the estimated base salary range is between $146,000 - $178,000 CAD. The actual base salary will vary based on various factors, including market and individual qualifications objectively assessed during the interview process. The listed range above is a guideline, and the base salary range for this role may be modified.

In addition to base salary, your compensation package may include additional components such as equity, sales incentive pay (for most sales roles), and benefits.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Most importantly, we seek people who are excited about crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.


We are looking for an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer to join our team. The Coinbase Machine Learning team is committed to developing sophisticated ML models that make our platform more secure, expand usage of Coinbase through personalized recommendations, and improve the user experience for our customers. Our mission is to keep building scalable, adaptive, blockchain aware ML systems that help our users explore and discover new use cases for Crypto on Coinbase and on the blockchain.

The Machine Learning org is a part of our Platform Product Group. The Platform Product Group’s mission is to build a trusted, scalable, and compliant platform to maximize velocity, efficiency and quality.

Layer 2 features such as 802.1d bridging, the 802.1d Spanning Tree Protocol, the 802.1ax Link Aggregation Control Protocol, the 802.1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol, or RFC 1812 IP routing.
Ability to utilize, test, and debug packet forwarding engine and a hardware component’s vendor provided software libraries in your solutions.
Infrastructure functions related to distributed systems such as messaging, signalling, databases, and command line interface techniques.
Hands on experience in the design and development of ethernet bridging or routing related software or distributed systems software is desirable.
