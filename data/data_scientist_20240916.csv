First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Most importantly, we seek people who are excited about crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article.

At Warner Music Group, we’re a global collective of music makers and music lovers, tech innovators and inspired entrepreneurs, game-changing creatives and passionate team members. Here, we know that each talent makes our collective bolder and brighter. We are guided by four core principles that underpin everything we do across all our diverse businesses:


Music is Everything: Music is our passion, and we can never get enough. Tastes, trends, and tech will change, but great artists and songwriters will always be our driving force.
Global Growth, Local Expertise: Music is a global language. Through communication and collaboration, our success can come from anywhere and translate everywhere.
Innovation and Insight: Pushing the boundaries requires the best information and the boldest imagination. We use both to create the future.
Empowered by People: Like the artists we serve and the music they make, our differences make us stronger. This is a place where every talent can belong and build a career.


We remain committed to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We know it fosters a culture where you can truly belong, contribute, and grow. We encourage applications from people of any age, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion, ethnicity, disability, veteran status, and any other characteristic or identity.

Consider a career at WMG and get the best of both worlds – an innovative global music company that retains the creative spirit of a nimble independent.

A little bit about our team:

WMG’s Business Intelligence team (BI) works to influence WMG’s strategy and day-to-day operations by developing thoughtful insights & intelligence from its core business practices. The BI team works with various departments across Warner Music’s Central Functions, Recorded Music, & Music Publishing Divisions to understand the trends and dynamics that drive the constant evolution of our business. Our goal for this role is to strengthen our analytical power and bring improved rigor to the insights we deliver to our family of labels and operators. We work with partners across the company to establish best practices for breaking artists and sustaining catalog repertoire across consumption platforms, gauge the impact of marketing initiatives and campaigns, and work to understand user behavior around the world.

Your role:

Intelligence is the lifeblood of today’s music business, and in this role you’ll get a chance to apply your creativity and problem-solving skills to help our labels and artists connect with consumers across an array of media and mediums. Because the BI team works closely with departments across the company, you will have the opportunity to see the inner workings and decision-making within a global music company - and the ability to influence those decisions with thoughtful intelligence work. We’re a collaborative team that loves learning new things, sharing ideas, thinking about the future of the music industry – and helping our company get there.

Here you’ll get to:


Lead data science projects from inception to completion on topics such as consumption and revenue forecasts, digital advertising forecasts, global trends analysis, business performance trends, and more.
Apply advanced data analysis and statistical modeling techniques to address complex business challenges. Develop and maintain production-level models, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
Work closely with Business Intelligence, Strategy, Corporate Finance, and operators to understand business needs, and provide actionable insights to a diverse audience across the business.
Proactively identify areas where data science can add value by experimenting with different hypotheses and techniques to improve existing processes and techniques within the BI team.
Utilize advanced tools and frameworks for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
Promote and participate in a culture of continuous learning within the team by providing feedback, sharing knowledge, and mentoring more junior team members.


About you:


Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Data Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, or a related field.
1-3 years of full-time post-graduation experience in the music, entertainment, sports, or financial services industry. Candidates with a PhD can be considered for this level.
Experience and comfort in working with data from globally-trusted third-party sources like the UN, IMF, OECD, and World Bank.
Demonstrated ability to lead and execute data science projects with minimal supervision.
Proficiency in programming languages such as Python or R for data analysis and model development.
Experience with machine learning frameworks and statistical tools.
Strong understanding of SQL and working with large datasets.
Familiarity with data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI.
Expertise in fundamental data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling techniques.
Ability to quickly learn and adapt to new techniques and technologies.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to explain complex concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
Strong problem-solving abilities, with a bias towards action and a proactive approach to identifying opportunities and challenges.


We’d love it if you also had:


Familiarity with the streaming music landscape or other digital media
Experience building analytical products and dashboards within BI software like Tableau or other environments like Streamlit.

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Most importantly, we seek people who are excited about crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

You will develop and deploy models that enable scalable curation of RWD. This will include multi-source integrations and reconciliations, creating derived features from the source data (e.g., abstraction of clinical concepts from unstructured data), and facilitating data quality assessments. You will work with a diverse cross-functional team to build reusable and scalable tools and to deliver products that unlock information from structured and unstructured clinical data.

Responsibilities


Work closely with cross-functional partners to design and create longitudinal datasets integrating multiple data sources.
Build and implement highly accurate machine learning models / AI tools using sparsely labeled healthcare datasets.
Implement, build on and augment existing LLM/NLP tools to maximize the value of using unstructured medical data across a range of research and care applications.
Become an expert in our data’s capabilities and limitations. Solve difficult, non-routine analysis problems, handling data challenges from a real-world setting.
Communicate technical methods and results clearly in well structured reports and presentations to a range of technical and non-technical audiences.


Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications


Advanced degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., data sciences, statistics, biomedical informatics, computer science, applied mathematics, or similar), or equivalent practical experience.
2+ years experience applying advanced machine learning and AI techniques (supervised and unsupervised methods, LLMs, NLP) to clinical data.
Direct experience working with and curating real-world data, such as EHR, including a deep understanding of the complexities of this structured and unstructured clinical data.
Strong proficiency in Python.


Preferred Qualifications


Familiarity with medical terminologies and ontologies.
Familiarity with software engineering practices and experience developing production software.
Experience working with clinical subject matter experts.
Ability to work cross-functionally on teams, with a tolerance for ambiguity.
Creative and methodical problem solving: understand needs, identify options, form hypotheses, generate robust results, make informed decisions, and learn faster through feedback.

We’re developing new tools and capabilities to amplify the human experience. To lead this transformative shift in mobility, we’ve built a world-class team in Energy & Materials, Human-Centered AI, Human Interactive Driving, and Robotics.

The Mission

Make general-purpose robots a reality.

The Challenge

We envision a future where robots assist with household chores and cooking, aid the elderly in maintaining their independence, and enable people to spend more time on the activities they enjoy most. To achieve this, robots need to be able to operate reliably in messy, unstructured environments. Our mission is to answer the question “What will it take to create truly general-purpose robots that can accomplish a wide variety of tasks in settings like human homes with minimal human supervision?”. We believe that the answer lies in cultivating large-scale datasets of physical interaction from a variety of sources and building on the latest advances in machine learning to learn general purpose robot behaviors from this data.

The Team

Our goal is to revolutionize the field of robotic manipulation, enabling long-horizon dexterous behaviors to be efficiently taught, learned, and improved over time in diverse, real world environments.

Our team has deep cross-functional expertise across simulation, perception, controls, and machine learning, and we measure our success in terms of fundamental capabilities development, as well as research impact via open-source software and publications. Our north star is fundamental technological advancement in building robots which can flexibly perform a wide variety of tasks in diverse environments with minimal human supervision. Come join us and let’s make general-purpose robots a reality.

We operate a fleet of robots, and robot-embodied teaching and deployment is a key part of our strategy. Some of our ongoing work is highlighted here.

The Opportunity

We’re looking for a driven research scientist or research engineer with a strong background in embodied machine learning and a “make it happen” mentality. The ideal candidate is able to operate independently when needed, but works well as part of a larger integrated group at the cutting edge of state-of-the-art robotics and machine learning.

Be a key member of the team and play a critical role in rapid progress measured by both the development of internal capabilities and high-impact external publication.
Collaborate with internal research scientists and our partner labs at top academic research universities including MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, CMU, Columbia, and Princeton to drive pioneering research at scale.




Qualifications
4+ years of relevant industry experience or a PhD.
Experience training large models and deploying them on embodied systems.
Extensive practical experience with Machine Learning using a major framework such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. Familiarity with data pipelines, model serving and optimization, cloud training, and dataset management is also useful.
Strong understanding of the state-of-the-art in behavior learning, language, and/or computer vision.
Some familiarity with robots and the challenges inherent in conducting research on physical hardware platforms.
Strong proficiency in Python.
An ability to move fast and switch between modes of rapid prototyping and robust implementation as required.
A strong track record of impact, either via first author research publications at top-tier machine learning or robotics conferences, or via meaningful contributions to successful industry initiatives.
