Better breast cancer screening should be a universal offering to every woman in the world. Vara’s AI-powered software platform, created with screening radiologists in Germany, mitigates much of the human subjectivity associated with reading mammography results—and reduces the repetitive work screening physicians are routinely subjected to—we’re making breast cancer screening more effective, more measurable, and more accessible for everyone, everywhere. By democratizing access to early screening around the world, we deliver measurable impact backed by clinical evidence. We are partnering globally, to deliver breast cancer screening where it is needed most.

As the first company from Europe’s leading AI venture studio Merantix, Vara has grown since 2018 to become a 50-member international team. Our diverse team consists of highly motivated and ambitious entrepreneurs, healthcare professionals, and technology experts.

Soils are the unsung hero in the fight against climate change. With your help we want to uncover and use this secret. As data engineer at Seqana you will acquire and harmonize data on soils to unlock the potential of soil carbon sequestration for climate protection.

About Seqana:

Seqana is an EU- and venture-backed start-up building monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) tools to drive soil carbon sequestration and the transition towards regenerative and climate-preserving agriculture.

One of the most powerful (and underutilized) solutions to climate change is capturing carbon in soils via regenerative agricultural practices. This approach has the potential for several times more climate impact than planting forests, while also providing extensive co-benefits such as erosion mitigation and improved water quality, food security, and biodiversity.

Existing solutions for MRV for the carbon market are one of the main drivers of cost and effort, and often the limiting factor for new project development. At Seqana, we combine satellite imagery, our extensive proprietary library of soil datasets, and machine learning to provide an accurate, cost-effective, and efficient MRV solution for soil organic carbon. Our product enables project developers, large corporations and NGOS with a scalable solution to measure and quantify the impact of their regenerative agricultural practices on soil carbon sequestration, enabling them to report credible CO2 reductions.

Tasks

Our growing team is looking for an ambitious and driven soil data scientist to help us quantify soil organic carbon and its sequestration by using better data. You will play a crucial part in ensuring and improving the quality of soil data we work with, and the accuracy of the statistical models derived from it. Your work will directly contribute to the advancement of our MRV and sampling tools, helping to drive effective climate solutions through innovative technology.

We're looking for someone who brings a deep understanding in soil science, an analytical mindset, and data science skills. You will be part of a passionate team that aims to have a direct positive impact on the world. We value proactivity, authenticity, creativity, and empathy in our company culture.

Manage the onboarding of new datasets and implement rigorous data quality processes
Apply a soil science perspective and ensure that our data pipelines and modeling approaches are grounded in a deep understanding of soil processes and dynamics
Standardize our data discovery, acquisition, and harmonization processes
Develop analytical data models and dashboards to serve the needs of insights and analytics
Collaborate with stakeholders across the company to constantly optimize the data infrastructure and associated processes



Requirements

What you bring:


A track record of research in soil science, particularly in SOC and its implications for climate change and agricultural land management
2-4 years of experience in data science roles or equivalent, with a strong foundation in statistical analysis
Proficiency in Python and SQL - with experience in automating data processing and conducting data analyses
Experience with soil sampling methods, laboratory analysis techniques, and understanding of SOC measurement best practices and standards
Ability to work and communicate effectively in an agile, fast-paced startup environment
A proactive, can-do attitude with the ability to quickly adapt, learn, and embrace change
Passion for environmental sustainability and climate tech



What makes you stand out:


Bonus: Knowledge of leading voluntary carbon standards and methodologies, e.g. VCS, Gold Standard or CAR
Bonus: Experience in carbon statistical modeling or process-based models such as Century, RothC, or DNDC
Bonus: Experience with machine learning, including model training and evaluation, is a big plus



Benefits

Benefits you can expect:


Be part of our highly motivated, committed, and international team with flat hierarchies that is working on solving one of societies’ biggest challenges: Climate Change
Witness and shape the evolution of a new business being built
Collaborative DevOps culture with opportunities for continuous learning and improvement
Work in a casual environment with flexible hours and some ability to work from home
Competitive salary, benefits, and compensation package
Drinks, snacks, team events, and your choice of hardware

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

About The Consumer Data Science Team

Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists (Analytics) and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering team who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience that requires a good mix of technical and stakeholder engagement skills. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics or data science role. Data Scientists at Wolt take ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we're looking for someone like you.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland and Sweden. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
4+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent for product development (preferably consumer-facing).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Data Engineer - MLOps Focus

Berlin based - m/f/d - full-time

What We Do At Plato

Plato is building the digital backbone of the global trade economy. Starting with the $48T wholesale industry, we empower the modern wholesaler to connect their people and data in a single analytics and workflow hub. By leveraging data science and AI, we automate workflows and combat labor shortages, making SMB wholesalers competitive with large corporations.

Why We Do What We Do

The future of wholesale is data-driven. Unlike popular opinion, Industrial SMEs are ready to make the step to become more proactive in their processes but lack the technology to steer them to success. Our founders come from a wholesale family and gathered a rock star team of ex-Big Tech, VC, and top-tier consulting companies to reshape the operations of this $48tn industry. Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.

About Merchant Group at Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business. Their core mission is to provide merchants with self-service tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use.

About The Merchant Analytics Team

Merchant Analytics is an embedded analytics function within the Merchant Group. The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

We're making Africa the first cashless continent.

In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.

We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.

Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in.....

About the Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has got Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Develop and automate forecasting models to plan the capacity of the support centers across different locations.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track scheduling efficiency, occupancy rates, and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building forecasting models & time series analysis (Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters or similar).
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in Cost Analysis, What-if Scenario Analysis, Capacity planning, and Workforce Management is nice to have but not mandatory.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

At T&S, whether you are a junior or an experienced consultant, you can move quickly through different projects, develop your skills and accelerate your career.




Projects - You will work in a stimulating environment. You will be in contact with experts and be at the heart of innovations. You can work in different industries or become an expert in a particular field. You can take advantage of paid training, certifications and language courses (English and German)!




Atmosphere - You will be with international and multi-cultural teams. Whether it is a Potluck, Karaoke, Karting, Oktoberfest or Summer and Winter parties, we want to have a good time with you. Having fun at work is important! It is a great way to bond and get to know each other better (but of course it is never an obligation!).

We're making Africa the first cashless continent.

In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.

We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.

Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in.....

Build and apply machine learning models to improve product features and to analyze heterogeneous treatment effects (e.g. using random forests and related methods).
Take ownership of the analytics process - from project scoping and design through communicating findings to stakeholders.


Key Details


You can work remotely from anywhere (between UTC -5 and +2) with reliable internet access.
You’re willing to travel to one of our key markets once per year for ~6 days (Wave covers all costs). We also provide a yearly stipend of $800 to meet with coworkers.
Our salaries are competitive and are calculated using a transparent formula. For this role, depending on your level, we offer a competitive base salary, plus a generous equity package.

What We Do At Plato

Plato is building the digital backbone of the global trade economy. Starting with the $48T wholesale industry, we empower the modern wholesaler to connect their people and data in a single analytics and workflow hub. By leveraging data science and AI, we automate workflows and combat labor shortages, making SMB wholesalers competitive with large corporations.

Why We Do What We Do

The future of wholesale is data-driven. Unlike popular opinion, Industrial SMEs are ready to make the step to become more proactive in their processes but lack the technology to steer them to success. Our founders come from a wholesale family and gathered a rock star team of ex-Big Tech, VC, and top-tier consulting companies to reshape the operations of this $48tn industry. Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.

About the Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has got Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.

Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building forecasting models & time series analysis (Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters or similar).
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in Cost Analysis, What-if Scenario Analysis, Capacity planning, and Workforce Management is nice to have but not mandatory.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

Job Description

We have recently established a Data Science team at the centre of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT). The team's mission is to engage with every corner of the department to uncover opportunities where innovative and experimental data science techniques can enhance existing products, processes, and analysis or generate entirely novel insights. This spans across sectors from telecoms to quantum to AI, all while embracing the possibility of failure as a path to discovery. Through this, we will help set the strategic direction for a department that prioritises data, evidence, and real-time monitoring, and ensure that DSIT becomes data-confident. 

This role offers an unparalleled opportunity to shape and define your position within an established team, pitching project ideas and exploring novel collaborations. Your contribution will help further a team culture that fosters creativity and innovation in leveraging the latest developments in data science, such as generative AI and LLMs, to deliver transformative insights. You will be joining at a critical time, with the chance to influence how data science shapes the department's impact in a still-evolving landscape.  

We are looking for highly motivated individuals to join us as we refine our operating model to enhance DSIT's data science capability. Technical skills are necessary for the role, but we are equally interested in your ability to be a proactive, independent thinker, eager to contribute to a team culture of innovation and collaboration. Our work will touch on exciting policy areas and involve collaboration with analytical teams across the department (such as the Government Office for Science), arms-length bodies (e.g. UK Research and Innovation and the UK Space Agency), and executive agencies (e.g., Building Digital UK). This means we will have the opportunity to explore many fascinating projects, either independently as a team or in collaboration with the analytical teams embedded across the department. Innovation is enshrined in the name, delivery plan, and ethos of the department, so we will have every opportunity to explore new ideas, trial novel approaches, and have the freedom to carve our own path. 

We have a vision for the team to be highly collaborative and proactively inclusive, with the flexibility to respond quickly to urgent asks while building out longer-term data science projects and products. We have access to multiple data science platforms and sandbox areas, meaning you can access truly novel tools and be working on cutting-edge data science techniques. Additionally, learning and development is a core focus of the team, with an afternoon a week reserved as protected time specifically for self-directed learning and development. We celebrate and value this L&D, and actively cascade outputs between members of the team.

Person specification

The team's mission is to engage with every corner of the department to uncover opportunities where innovative and experimental data science techniques can enhance existing products, processes, and analysis or generate entirely novel insights. This spans across sectors from telecoms to quantum to AI, all while embracing the possibility of failure as a path to discovery. Through this, we will help set the strategic direction for a department that prioritises data, evidence, and real-time monitoring, and ensure that DSIT becomes data-confident. <br><br>This role offers an unparalleled opportunity to shape and define your position within an established team, pitching project ideas and exploring novel collaborations. Your contribution will help further a team culture that fosters creativity and innovation in leveraging the latest developments in data science, such as generative AI and LLMs, to deliver transformative insights. You will be joining at a critical time, with the chance to influence how data science shapes the department's impact in a still-evolving landscape.  <br><br>We are looking for highly motivated individuals to join us as we refine our operating model to enhance DSIT's data science capability. Technical skills are necessary for the role, but we are equally interested in your ability to be a proactive, independent thinker, eager to contribute to a team culture of innovation and collaboration. Our work will touch on exciting policy areas and involve collaboration with analytical teams across the department (such as the Government Office for Science), arms-length bodies (e.g. UK Research and Innovation and the UK Space Agency), and executive agencies (e.g., Building Digital UK). This means we will have the opportunity to explore many fascinating projects, either independently as a team or in collaboration with the analytical teams embedded across the department. Innovation is enshrined in the name, delivery plan, and ethos of the department, so we will have every opportunity to explore new ideas, trial novel approaches, and have the freedom to carve our own path. <br><br>We have a vision for the team to be highly collaborative and proactively inclusive, with the flexibility to respond quickly to urgent asks while building out longer-term data science projects and products. We have access to multiple data science platforms and sandbox areas, meaning you can access truly novel tools and be working on cutting-edge data science techniques.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.

What you’ll do

As a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.

Responsibilities


Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


A Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2025, or equivalent work experience
Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts



Preferred Qualifications


One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$104,000 - C$156,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.

Responsibilities


Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts



Preferred Qualifications


One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases

For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.
