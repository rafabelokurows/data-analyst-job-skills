From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they're at the heart of everything we do.

Key Responsibilities


Develop and refine risk, demand, and market models using statistical techniques and actuarial methods
Analyse insurance data to identify trends, anomalies, and opportunities for improvements
Collaborate with the technical and street pricing teams to implement pricing changes effectively

Support continuous improvements by integrating new tools and technologies into the pricing process
Required Skills


Education{{:}} Bachelor's or Master's degree in Statistics, Mathematics, Actuarial Science, Data Science or related field
Experience{{:}} Proven experience in non-life insurance pricing and modelling and advanced data science, with a strong focus on model development, deployment, and tooling
Technical Skills{{:}}
Python Proficiency{{:}} Strong Python programming skills, with experience in developing and maintaining analytics packages and tools. Familiarity with data science libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn
SQL{{:}} Proficient in SQL, particularly with cloud data warehouses like Snowflake

Joining Zego is a career-defining move. People go further here, reaching their full potential to achieve extraordinary things. 

We're spread throughout the UK and Europe, and united by our drive to get things done. We're proud of our company and our culture - a friendly and inclusive space where we can lift each other up and celebrate our wins every day.

Together, we're setting the bar higher, delivering exceptional work that makes a difference. Our people are the most important part of our story, and everyone here plays a role. There's loads of room to learn and grow, and you'll get the freedom to steer your career wherever you want.

You'll work alongside a talented group who embrace each other's differences and aren't afraid of a challenge. We recognise our achievements, learn from our mistakes, and help each other to be the best we can be. Together, we're making insurance matter. 

How we work

We believe that teams work better when they have time to collaborate and space to get things done. We call it Zego Hybrid.

We ask you to spend at least one day a week in our central London office. You have the flexibility to choose the day that works best for you and your team. We cover the costs for all company-wide events (3 per year), and also provide a separate hybrid contribution to help pay towards other travel costs. We think it's a good mix of collaborative face time and flexible home-working, setting us up to achieve the right balance between work and life.

Benefits

We reward our people well. Join us and you'll get a market-competitive salary, private medical insurance, company share options, generous holiday allowance, and a whole lot of wellbeing benefits. And that's just for starters.

We're an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

Job Description

We have recently established a Data Science team at the centre of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT). The team's mission is to engage with every corner of the department to uncover opportunities where innovative and experimental data science techniques can enhance existing products, processes, and analysis or generate entirely novel insights. This spans across sectors from telecoms to quantum to AI, all while embracing the possibility of failure as a path to discovery. Through this, we will help set the strategic direction for a department that prioritises data, evidence, and real-time monitoring, and ensure that DSIT becomes data-confident. 

This role offers an unparalleled opportunity to shape and define your position within an established team, pitching project ideas and exploring novel collaborations. Your contribution will help further a team culture that fosters creativity and innovation in leveraging the latest developments in data science, such as generative AI and LLMs, to deliver transformative insights. You will be joining at a critical time, with the chance to influence how data science shapes the department's impact in a still-evolving landscape.  

We are looking for highly motivated individuals to join us as we refine our operating model to enhance DSIT's data science capability. Technical skills are necessary for the role, but we are equally interested in your ability to be a proactive, independent thinker, eager to contribute to a team culture of innovation and collaboration. Our work will touch on exciting policy areas and involve collaboration with analytical teams across the department (such as the Government Office for Science), arms-length bodies (e.g. UK Research and Innovation and the UK Space Agency), and executive agencies (e.g., Building Digital UK). This means we will have the opportunity to explore many fascinating projects, either independently as a team or in collaboration with the analytical teams embedded across the department. Innovation is enshrined in the name, delivery plan, and ethos of the department, so we will have every opportunity to explore new ideas, trial novel approaches, and have the freedom to carve our own path. 

We have a vision for the team to be highly collaborative and proactively inclusive, with the flexibility to respond quickly to urgent asks while building out longer-term data science projects and products. We have access to multiple data science platforms and sandbox areas, meaning you can access truly novel tools and be working on cutting-edge data science techniques. Additionally, learning and development is a core focus of the team, with an afternoon a week reserved as protected time specifically for self-directed learning and development. We celebrate and value this L&D, and actively cascade outputs between members of the team.

Person specification

Key Responsibilities

The work within the team is intended to be experimental and innovative. Because of this, the projects that you will get to work on will be varied. You will have the opportunity to use a range of data science techniques, and to propose new approaches that provide insight and improve data practices. The following gives an indication of the kind of work we are currently pursuing. 


Developing chatbots through the use of large language models to support the department’s ability to deal with large amounts of unstructured text data.  
Developing the department’s natural language processing capability to generate new datasets to track DSIT’s core interests.  
Developing web apps to ensure insights are being delivered to stakeholders in the most digestible format to enable data-led decision-making.  
Ensuring reliable pipelines to ingest data into the department and delivering it in a usable format to analytical teams.  
Building out the data science capability across the department – supporting analysts to add coding to their analytical toolkit, thinking about how we can embed data science across all areas of the business and supporting DSIT’s ambitions to be using data in the most innovative way in government.  
Deploying advanced analysis techniques, such as machine learning, to support policy development across the department, including exploring novel datasets. 
Delivering visualisations directly to the Ministerial team to support delivery of the department’s top priorities.



Technical skills are essential for this role, but we equally value non-technical skills because your responsibilities will also include the following:


Approaching problems analytically, eager to explore the depths of data science and engineering challenges.
Identifying user needs and developing solutions starting with a minimum viable product (MVP).           
Communicating technical concepts to non-technical audiences and the benefits of data science approaches.

The team's mission is to engage with every corner of the department to uncover opportunities where innovative and experimental data science techniques can enhance existing products, processes, and analysis or generate entirely novel insights. This spans across sectors from telecoms to quantum to AI, all while embracing the possibility of failure as a path to discovery. Through this, we will help set the strategic direction for a department that prioritises data, evidence, and real-time monitoring, and ensure that DSIT becomes data-confident. <br><br>This role offers an unparalleled opportunity to shape and define your position within an established team, pitching project ideas and exploring novel collaborations. Your contribution will help further a team culture that fosters creativity and innovation in leveraging the latest developments in data science, such as generative AI and LLMs, to deliver transformative insights. You will be joining at a critical time, with the chance to influence how data science shapes the department's impact in a still-evolving landscape.  <br><br>We are looking for highly motivated individuals to join us as we refine our operating model to enhance DSIT's data science capability. Technical skills are necessary for the role, but we are equally interested in your ability to be a proactive, independent thinker, eager to contribute to a team culture of innovation and collaboration. Our work will touch on exciting policy areas and involve collaboration with analytical teams across the department (such as the Government Office for Science), arms-length bodies (e.g. UK Research and Innovation and the UK Space Agency), and executive agencies (e.g., Building Digital UK). This means we will have the opportunity to explore many fascinating projects, either independently as a team or in collaboration with the analytical teams embedded across the department. Innovation is enshrined in the name, delivery plan, and ethos of the department, so we will have every opportunity to explore new ideas, trial novel approaches, and have the freedom to carve our own path. <br><br>We have a vision for the team to be highly collaborative and proactively inclusive, with the flexibility to respond quickly to urgent asks while building out longer-term data science projects and products. We have access to multiple data science platforms and sandbox areas, meaning you can access truly novel tools and be working on cutting-edge data science techniques. Additionally, learning and development is a core focus of the team, with an afternoon a week reserved as protected time specifically for self-directed learning and development. We celebrate and value this L&amp;D, and actively cascade outputs between members of the team.<br><br><strong>Person specification<br><br></strong><strong>Key Responsibilities<br><br></strong>The work within the team is intended to be experimental and innovative. Because of this, the projects that you will get to work on will be varied.

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.

Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is to maximise business impact within one of many business areas. You will help answer questions like:



Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?



The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Requirements



A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)
Experience conducting A/B experiments
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems



Why Deliveroo

Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.

We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

Workplace & Benefits

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.

What you’ll do

As a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.

Loom Video

Our Founder/CEO, Gabe Greenberg, created a more in-depth Loom video that we highly recommend you watch! Check it out here: https://www.loom.com/share/5a8972c7fbbf46aaa3f389b2b6391c40

Overview

You’ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for the world's most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the most prominent players in the AI/LLM space today. We seek software engineers with 3+ years of experience to train large AI language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!

What Will I Be Doing?


Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""Which piece of Python code is better?"" to ""Make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterward to make it faster.""


Pay Rates

Compensation rates vary based on location and experience.

Note: The following rates are starting points and may be subject to change:

No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the most prominent players in the AI/LLM space today. We seek software engineers with 3+ years of experience to train large AI language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!<br><br><strong>What Will I Be Doing?<br><br></strong><ul><li>Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale</li><li>Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code</li><li>Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively</li><li>We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""Which piece of Python code is better?"" to ""Make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterward to make it faster.""<br><br></li></ul><strong>Pay Rates<br><br></strong>Compensation rates vary based on location and experience.<br><br>Note: The following rates are starting points and may be subject to change:<br><br>To view the complete list of locations and their values, click here.<br><br><ul><li>US - 50/hr</li><li>Brazil - 25.40 USD /hr</li><li>Egypt - 14.60 USD /hr</li><li>Philippines - 24.20 USD /hr</li><li>Expectations are 15+ hours per week; however, there is no upper limit. We have engineers working 20-40 hours per week and some working 40+ hours per week. You can work as much as you want to. You'll get paid weekly per hour of work done on the platform. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Contract Length<br><br></strong><ul><li>Long term, there is no end date. They expect to have work for the next 2 years. </li><li>You can end the contract at any time. We hope you will commit to 12 months of work, but if you start and it's not a fit for you, we totally understand. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Flexible Schedules<br><br></strong><ul><li>Developers can set their own hours—ideal candidates will be interested in spending 40 hours a week. They will be with teams, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but they will also be incredibly flexible on working hours. </li><li>You can take a 3-hour lunch, no problem. Instead of tracking your hours, you are paid according to time spent on the platform, calculated in the coding exercises. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Interview Process<br><br></strong><ul><li>Apply using this Ashby form. </li><li>If you seem like a good fit, we'll send an async RLHF code review that will take 35 minutes and must be finished within 72 hours of us sending it. </li><li>You'll receive credentials to the RLHF platform. We'll then set up a group call to answer any further questions about onboarding with the company. </li><li>You'll perform a simulated production-level task (RLHF task) on the platform. This will be your final interview, which will ultimately determine your employment and leveling. Successful completion of this process provides you with an opportunity to work on projects as they become available. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Tech Stack Priorities<br><br></strong><ul><li>The current priority for this team is engineers with either a Data Science background who know Python well or software engineers who are well versed in Python. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Required Qualifications:<br><br></strong><ul><li>3+ years of experience in a software engineering/software development role. </li><li>Complete fluency in the English language. </li><li>Ability to articulate complex scientific concepts clearly and engagingly. </li><li>Excellent attention to detail and ability to maintain consistency in writing. </li><li>Solid understanding of grammar, punctuation, and style guidelines. </li><li>Proficiency with Python<br><br></li></ul><strong>Nice To Haves:<br><br></strong><ul><li>Bachelor's or Master’s degree in Computer Science</li><li>Proficiency in working with one or more of the following: Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++.
