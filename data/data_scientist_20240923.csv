About Phaidra

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.


Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, and India.

Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.<br><br>Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:<br><br><ul><li>We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.</li><li>We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.</li><li>We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.<br><br></li></ul>Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.<br><br>Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office.

Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the Allen Institute focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.

The Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics is focused on fundamental discoveries in systems neuroscience. We are interested in how the brain builds our understanding of the complex world to guide the flexible behaviors that address our biological needs. The answers will be in terms of defined neuron types and circuits interacting across the whole brain and body. We will develop next-generation methods and theories and employ a team-based approach for discovery neuroscience. Knowledge, data, models and tools will be widely shared, in part to support the development of therapies for brain disorders.

We are seeking a Scientist to lead a ground-breaking project that uses innovative approaches to label specific proteins in compartments of individual neurons - combining fine-scale neuronal morphology with transcriptomics and proteomics. The ideal candidate will have a strong interest and knowledge of protein design, production, and characterization, exemplarily leadership skills, and be team oriented. The successful candidate will work closely with expert Microscopists, Data Scientists and Engineers as well as Biologists to generate foundational data to contribute to our understanding of how protein composition in neurons contribute to computations within multi-regional circuits during behavior.

The Allen Institute believes that team science significantly benefits from the participation of diverse voices, experiences, and backgrounds. Progress in science benefits from multiple perspectives. We are committed to increasing diversity across every team and encourage people from all backgrounds to apply for this role.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $136,000 - $160,000 per year.

Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article. Please exercise caution and cease communications if something feels suspicious about your interactions.

Compensation Range: $175K - $300K

We're on a mission to transform spoken communication for individuals, teams and organizations of any size. Meetings may be our most information rich channel for work, but suffer from a lack of structure and documentation. At Supernormal, we're solving this problem with focus, design and craft.

We've been working on this since 2019 and have customers like Snap, Salesforce, Replay, Gitcoin, Pinterest and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we are growing rapidly and are excited for new teammates to join who are the best at what they do. We're passionately building a team that is as diverse and creative as the millions of people we serve worldwide.

Supernormal is a remote first company and does not require co-location. We have annual team retreats and gather several times a quarter.

About The Role

Machine learning engineers at Supernormal build the AI that superpowers the core product experience for people's meetings including transcription, note generation, and task automation. The AI team builds reliable and secure services that use the most advanced AI models in the market to generate millions of high-quality meeting notes to a rapidly growing customer base. Our work revolves heavily around software engineering, too - we are looking for people with a drive to roll up their sleeves and get new models and features out to users as quickly as possible.

What You'll Work On

As an ML engineer on Supernormal's AI team, you will be responsible for the end-to-end development of our AI solutions for meeting notes, question answering, and task completion. Your work will encompass LLM API calls, custom model training and deployment, speech recognition, quality evaluation and fixes, retrieval augmented generation, and much more. You'll play a key role in optimizing for cost, latency, and quality. Some of the projects you'll work on include:


Prompt engineering using state-of-the-art techniques to improve the core meeting assistant scenarios
Building and shipping custom machine learning models to augment the AI stack, including improving transcript quality, reducing tokens sent to APIs, removing defects in LLM output, and extracting semi-structured data
Training and deploying custom large language models from open source using state-of-the-art techniques (LoRA, RLHF, instruction-tuning, etc) and fine tuning foundation models for a variety of business purposes
Developing new product experiences using NLP & LLMs that get better based on user feedback & iteration while collaborating with product engineers & design team
Defining and improving business & product metrics to optimize the quality and cost of AI usage
Improving LLM-powered search and question answering (using RAG) over sets of meetings
Advocating for, and building, new and better ways of doing things. You'll leave everything you touch just a bit better than you found it



Requirements

What you will bring

We are a fast-moving startup building zero-to-one products on top of large language models. The ideal candidate has a strong machine learning background and a hacker mindset, someone who can both spin up Jupyter Notebooks to train models and also excel at writing solid, fast production code for deployment.


AI/ML Experience: Demonstrated proficiency in AI/ML with a track record of at least 3-5 years experience building machine learning systems, up to speed on the latest in NLP & LLMs, and proficient in data curation, modeling, and training models. We require skills for shipping and maintaining ML in production settings
A Solid Educational Foundation: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, AI, Mathematics, or related field; Master's degree or PhD a plus
Versatile Software Engineering Skills: A solid engineering background with a robust foundation in software engineering principles. You have written code for and supported production engineering systems.
Proficient in Python and SQL: our AI stack uses Python & PyTorch and interfaces with Ruby on Rails (bonus if you know it, but not required) and we write a lot of SQL queries on top of Snowflake to pull data


What we'll expect of you


A collaborative and open outlook — we're all about lifting each other up and getting better every day
A willingness to get deep into a problem even when it seems impossible. You'll always have support from the team
Confidence operating with high agency. We'll work together to decide what's important, but we'd love for you to bring (and build!) your own ideas
You'll come in willing to learn why things are the way they are, then suggest a better way
You'll understand that there's no difference between ""my idea"" and ""their idea."" It's our ideas and we're all responsible for it
You'll approach speed bumps and reviews through a ""how can the team level up?"" lens — let's all get better and learn, together


What you can expect from us


We're a fully distributed team spread between Pacific Time (California) and Central European Time (Stockholm) with lots of places in between. We'll see you most days in Slack, Google Meet, GitHub issues, and Notion. Sometimes in person in a place with a warm breeze
We're a friendly bunch and are happy to pair, talk through, or otherwise assist any time
Honest and timely feedback. We're all better when we can have candid conversations about what is and isn't working
A willingness to listen to your ideas: how can the codebase, our product, or team be better?
A respect for your time outside of work. We all work hard here, but we never forget to rest and have fun



Benefits

💰 Competitive salary, 401K

📈 Stock options

🏥 Full healthcare coverage (Medical, Dental, and Vision)

🚀 Totally remote. Not hybrid. Remote. No return-to-office here

Part of the applike group ecosystem, adjoe is home to an advanced tech stack, powerful financial backing from Bertelsmann, and a highly motivated workforce to be reckoned with.




Meet Your Team: WAVE Data Science




Did you know that in-app ads are sold in a real-time auction before they get rendered in thousands of mobile apps? Dozens of ad networks compete for every single view, choosing their best ad and deciding what price to bid in just a couple hundred milliseconds. We at adjoe have developed our own ad network that takes part in this competition, fighting against giants like Google, Meta and TikTok to present its own ads. To stand a chance in this fierce competition, the WAVE Data Science team builds creative algorithms using technologies ranging from simple linear regression to advanced deep learning models. Everything we do is based on solid research about user behavior as well as publisher and advertiser analysis to build competitive bidding algorithms that balance the advertisers’ goals, the publishers’ expectations and of course the user experience. To make our inventions come to life we use state-of-the art technology and work closely with the product and business teams to shape the future of adjoe’s core business and technologies.




What You Will Do

Grow and manage a data science team: hire new team members, organize routines in the team, set up guidelines (code style, documentation, best practices).
Understand business goals to come up with suitable data solutions to make WAVE a strong competitor in the AdTech industry.
Be hands-on by working on data science tasks on your own (at least 50% of the working time).
Be a mentor and train data scientists in the team to make them better in analysis, programming, communication, and planning.
Be the owner of critical data science documentation (experiments, implementation details).
Align with the WAVE product team and adjoe’s Cloud Infrastructure team on priorities, implementation details, tools and best practices.
Contribute to the company’s strategic planning. Work on a long-term roadmap and quarterly OKRs.




Who You Are

You have a tech degree (mathematics, physics, computer science, or similar). Alternatively 5 years of professional experience in data science.
You have 2+ years’ of experience working as a Lead (hiring people, doing regular 1-1s, creating career plans).
You have a strong knowledge of Python, R, Scala, Julia or similar typical programming languages for Data Science.
You have excellent analytical skills and for every problem you see more than just one solution.
You have experience drilling into large amounts of data coming from various sources – including AWS Athena, Kafka, Spark, Flink, S3, MySQL.
You are able to dive deep into mathematical foundations and explain complex topics in a simple way.
You are an excellent cross-team communicator.
Plus: you have experience in building a Data Science tech stack (e.g. Airflow, Spark, Kafka, Flink) and can choose the right technologies for the job together with MLOps and Data Engineers.
