About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

About The Consumer Data Science Team

Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists (Analytics) and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering team who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience that requires a good mix of technical and stakeholder engagement skills. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics or data science role. Data Scientists at Wolt take ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we're looking for someone like you.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland and Sweden. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
5+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent for product development (preferably consumer-facing).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

At Vara, we are continuously seeking talented AI Research Scientists who are passionate about revolutionizing breast cancer screening. While we are not actively hiring for this position right now, we are eager to connect with exceptional candidates who are interested in joining our mission in the future. By submitting your application, you will be added to our talent pool, and we will reach out when suitable opportunities become available. Please note that while we are unable to provide immediate feedback or interviews, we value your interest and will keep your information on file for future consideration.

Recruiter applications are not welcome.

Better breast cancer screening should be a universal offering to every woman in the world. Vara’s AI-powered software platform, created with screening radiologists in Germany, mitigates much of the human subjectivity associated with reading mammography results—and reduces the repetitive work screening physicians are routinely subjected to—we’re making breast cancer screening more effective, more measurable, and more accessible for everyone, everywhere. By democratizing access to early screening around the world, we deliver measurable impact backed by clinical evidence. We are partnering globally, to deliver breast cancer screening where it is needed most.

As the first company from Europe’s leading AI venture studio Merantix, Vara has grown since 2018 to become a 50-member international team. Our diverse team consists of highly motivated and ambitious entrepreneurs, healthcare professionals, and technology experts.

Further information can be found on our website: www.vara.ai

Your role

The machine learning team at Vara researches, develops and productionizes high-performance AI models for breast cancer detection from mammography images. This requires solving a multi-view perception problem with an emphasis on AI safety to meet very high performance requirements.

Building on prior work to recognise trustworthy predictions [1], Vara has built a system that surpasses the metrics of individual radiologists via human-AI collaboration [2], and recognises cancers missed by humans enabling earlier detection [3]. With large-scale, prospective testing of the impact on screening system metrics [4], Vara is the established market leader in one of the most advanced public screening systems in the world and has deployed more than a million AI-assisted radiology reads.

Despite clinical metrics being improved by AI in today’s clinical practice already, we aim for perfection and continue to work towards fundamental solutions of AI for healthcare without drawing boundaries between research and engineering.

Exemplary Responsibilities


Research, train, evaluate and certify AI models for detecting breast cancer, pushing beyond the published SOTA.
Merge medical insights with AI to tailor our models for global needs
Validate AI efficacy across diverse datasets, ensuring robust performance.

A track record of research in ML or applied ML, ideally to medical images.
Profound knowledge of deep learning (especially CNNs and Transformers) in theory and practice.
Experience with real world, large scale datasets.
Fluent engineering (Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax, GCP/AWS/Azure, software development best practices)
Passion for good scientific practice, blending clean formal thinking with exacting engineering.


What we offer


Work flexibly In-office? From home? Somewhere in between? Whatever you prefer.
Team Culture We host regular team nights and events to foster company culture and cohesion.
Connect at our AI Campus Integration into the thriving AI startup and ML community via paper reading groups, weekly lunches, and events at the AI Campus as well as conferences.
Competitive salary We regularly benchmark salaries within the tech and healthcare industry.
Develop your career Dedicate yourself to impactful projects and have regular, meaningful career development sessions with your manager.

Cherry Ventures is supporting our portfolio with this hire

Berlin based - m/f/d - full-time

What we do at Plato

Plato is building the digital backbone of the global trade economy. Starting with the $48T wholesale industry, we empower the modern wholesaler to connect their people and data in a single analytics and workflow hub. By leveraging data science and AI, we automate workflows and combat labor shortages, making SMB wholesalers competitive with large corporations.

🎯 Why we do what we do

The future of wholesale is data-driven. Unlike popular opinion, Industrial SMEs are ready to make the step to become more proactive in their processes but lack the technology to steer them to success. Our founders come from a wholesale family and gathered a rock star team of ex-Big Tech, VC, and top-tier consulting companies to reshape the operations of this $48tn industry. Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.

🔮 What we’re looking for

You will have the opportunity to develop a variety of models, such as recommendation engines, dynamic pricing systems, churn prediction models, and customer segmentation algorithms. You will be responsible for the entire lifecycle of these models, from creation to deployment, and ensuring they scale across different industries.

Our platform generates a wealth of data from user interactions, and a key part of your role will be feeding this data back into the models to continuously improve their performance. You’ll collaborate closely with our data engineering and product teams to ensure our portfolio of data products provide value to our users.

🚀 What you’d be working on

Tackle the challenge of building adaptable models that can be customized across various industries, such as construction, technical, and HVAC wholesale, ensuring that industry-specific needs are met.
Continuously refine and update models based on real-time platform data and customer feedback to ensure they evolve with our users’ needs.
Collaborate with data engineers and ML engineers to build efficient data pipelines that feed into and optimise machine learning models.
Design experiments to assess model performance and iteratively improve accuracy and scalability.
Implement automated model retraining and monitoring systems to ensure that models remain relevant and continue to perform in production environments.
Work closely with the product and engineering teams to align model outputs with business goals and deliver actionable insights to customers.
Build processes to efficiently manage the lifecycle of machine learning models, including versioning, experimentation, and reproducibility across different deployments.



🏅 What you bring along


3+ years of experience in data science, with a strong emphasis on machine learning model development and deployment.
Hands-on experience with recommender systems is highly valued—this will be a core component of the role.
A strong generalist mindset, capable of owning the full product lifecycle—from translating business problems into data science solutions to building and maintaining models in production.
Experience in building and running machine learning models end-to-end; you will own your models, ensuring they run smoothly in production and are continuously optimised.
Experience with MLFlow for model tracking and lifecycle management is desirable.
Hands-on experience with data engineering tools and platforms; a background in Databricks is highly valued.
Familiarity with NLP techniques is a plus, especially for customer segmentation and categorisation tasks.
Ability to wear multiple hats and thrive in a startup environment where flexibility and initiative are key.
Proficiency in German is plus.
We are unfortunately not able to sponsor visas - for this role, you will need to possess an existing EU/German work permit.



🛠️ The tools you will be using


Python
PySpark
Databricks
MLFlow
Model Serving Technologies
CI/CD Tools (e.g., Jenkins, Git)
Cloud Platforms (AWS)
Data Engineering Tools (Apache Spark, DBT)

Soils are the unsung hero in the fight against climate change. With your help we want to uncover and use this secret. As data engineer at Seqana you will acquire and harmonize data on soils to unlock the potential of soil carbon sequestration for climate protection.

About Seqana:

Seqana is an EU- and venture-backed start-up building monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) tools to drive soil carbon sequestration and the transition towards regenerative and climate-preserving agriculture.

One of the most powerful (and underutilized) solutions to climate change is capturing carbon in soils via regenerative agricultural practices. This approach has the potential for several times more climate impact than planting forests, while also providing extensive co-benefits such as erosion mitigation and improved water quality, food security, and biodiversity.

Existing solutions for MRV for the carbon market are one of the main drivers of cost and effort, and often the limiting factor for new project development. At Seqana, we combine satellite imagery, our extensive proprietary library of soil datasets, and machine learning to provide an accurate, cost-effective, and efficient MRV solution for soil organic carbon. Our product enables project developers, large corporations and NGOS with a scalable solution to measure and quantify the impact of their regenerative agricultural practices on soil carbon sequestration, enabling them to report credible CO2 reductions.

Tasks

Our growing team is looking for an ambitious and driven soil data scientist to help us quantify soil organic carbon and its sequestration by using better data. You will play a crucial part in ensuring and improving the quality of soil data we work with, and the accuracy of the statistical models derived from it. Your work will directly contribute to the advancement of our MRV and sampling tools, helping to drive effective climate solutions through innovative technology.

We're looking for someone who brings a deep understanding in soil science, an analytical mindset, and data science skills. You will be part of a passionate team that aims to have a direct positive impact on the world. We value proactivity, authenticity, creativity, and empathy in our company culture.

Impact you’ll own:


Manage the onboarding of new datasets and implement rigorous data quality processes
Apply a soil science perspective and ensure that our data pipelines and modeling approaches are grounded in a deep understanding of soil processes and dynamics
Standardize our data discovery, acquisition, and harmonization processes
Develop analytical data models and dashboards to serve the needs of insights and analytics
Collaborate with stakeholders across the company to constantly optimize the data infrastructure and associated processes



Requirements

What you bring:


A track record of research in soil science, particularly in SOC and its implications for climate change and agricultural land management
2-4 years of experience in data science roles or equivalent, with a strong foundation in statistical analysis
Proficiency in Python and SQL - with experience in automating data processing and conducting data analyses
Experience with soil sampling methods, laboratory analysis techniques, and understanding of SOC measurement best practices and standards
Ability to work and communicate effectively in an agile, fast-paced startup environment
A proactive, can-do attitude with the ability to quickly adapt, learn, and embrace change
Passion for environmental sustainability and climate tech



What makes you stand out:


Bonus: Knowledge of leading voluntary carbon standards and methodologies, e.g. VCS, Gold Standard or CAR
Bonus: Experience in carbon statistical modeling or process-based models such as Century, RothC, or DNDC
Bonus: Experience with machine learning, including model training and evaluation, is a big plus



Benefits

Benefits you can expect:


Be part of our highly motivated, committed, and international team with flat hierarchies that is working on solving one of societies’ biggest challenges: Climate Change
Witness and shape the evolution of a new business being built
Collaborative DevOps culture with opportunities for continuous learning and improvement
Work in a casual environment with flexible hours and some ability to work from home

          Join us in the global movement for climate action through data-driven soil carbon sequestration. Soils are the unsung hero in the fight against climate change. With your help we want to uncover and use this secret. As data engineer at Seqana you will acquire and harmonize data on soils to unlock the potential of soil carbon sequestration for climate protection.<br><br><strong>About Seqana:<br><br></strong>Seqana is an EU- and venture-backed start-up building monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) tools to drive soil carbon sequestration and the transition towards regenerative and climate-preserving agriculture.<br><br>One of the most powerful (and underutilized) solutions to climate change is capturing carbon in soils via regenerative agricultural practices. This approach has the potential for several times more climate impact than planting forests, while also providing extensive co-benefits such as erosion mitigation and improved water quality, food security, and biodiversity.<br><br>Existing solutions for MRV for the carbon market are one of the main drivers of cost and effort, and often <em>the</em> limiting factor for new project development. At Seqana, we combine satellite imagery, our extensive proprietary library of soil datasets, and machine learning to provide an accurate, cost-effective, and efficient MRV solution for soil organic carbon. Our product enables project developers, large corporations and NGOS with a scalable solution to measure and quantify the impact of their regenerative agricultural practices on soil carbon sequestration, enabling them to report credible CO2 reductions.<br><br>Tasks<br><br>Our growing team is looking for an ambitious and driven soil data scientist to help us quantify soil organic carbon and its sequestration by using better data. You will play a crucial part in ensuring and improving the quality of soil data we work with, and the accuracy of the statistical models derived from it.

About the Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has got Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

Over the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on identifying opportunities to resolve customer queries through automation & AI to decrease the need for human support and optimize the resolution time, building supporting KPIs & dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for product improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine product roadmap, automation & AI initiatives.

You're excited about this opportunity because you can:


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track the customer journey through the support, time to resolve queries, and other KPIs and advise on what we can do to improve.
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in event tracking and product analytics.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

What we do at Plato

Plato is building the digital backbone of the global trade economy. Starting with the $48T wholesale industry, we empower the modern wholesaler to connect their people and data in a single analytics and workflow hub. By leveraging data science and AI, we automate workflows and combat labor shortages, making SMB wholesalers competitive with large corporations.




🎯 Why we do what we do

The future of wholesale is data-driven. Unlike popular opinion, Industrial SMEs are ready to make the step to become more proactive in their processes but lack the technology to steer them to success. Our founders come from a wholesale family and gathered a rock star team of ex-Big Tech, VC, and top-tier consulting companies to reshape the operations of this $48tn industry. Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.




🔮 What we’re looking for

As a Data Scientist at Plato you will be tackling the complex challenge of building versatile models that serve multiple industries, ranging from construction and steel to technical and HVAC wholesalers. Each industry presents unique data sets and requires a tailored approach.

You will have the opportunity to develop a variety of models, such as recommendation engines, dynamic pricing systems, churn prediction models, and customer segmentation algorithms. You will be responsible for the entire lifecycle of these models, from creation to deployment, and ensuring they scale across different industries.

Our platform generates a wealth of data from user interactions, and a key part of your role will be feeding this data back into the models to continuously improve their performance. You’ll collaborate closely with our data engineering and product teams to ensure our portfolio of data products provide value to our users.




🚀 What you’d be working on

Develop, test, and deploy a wide range of machine learning models, including recommendation systems, dynamic pricing models, churn prediction algorithms, and customer categorisation systems.
Tackle the challenge of building adaptable models that can be customized across various industries, such as construction, technical, and HVAC wholesale, ensuring that industry-specific needs are met.
Continuously refine and update models based on real-time platform data and customer feedback to ensure they evolve with our users’ needs.
Collaborate with data engineers and ML engineers to build efficient data pipelines that feed into and optimise machine learning models.
Design experiments to assess model performance and iteratively improve accuracy and scalability.
Implement automated model retraining and monitoring systems to ensure that models remain relevant and continue to perform in production environments.
Work closely with the product and engineering teams to align model outputs with business goals and deliver actionable insights to customers.
Build processes to efficiently manage the lifecycle of machine learning models, including versioning, experimentation, and reproducibility across different deployments.




🏅 What you bring along

3+ years of experience in data science, with a strong emphasis on machine learning model development and deployment.
Hands-on experience with recommender systems is highly valued—this will be a core component of the role.
A strong generalist mindset, capable of owning the full product lifecycle—from translating business problems into data science solutions to building and maintaining models in production.
Experience in building and running machine learning models end-to-end; you will own your models, ensuring they run smoothly in production and are continuously optimised.
Experience with MLFlow for model tracking and lifecycle management is desirable.
Hands-on experience with data engineering tools and platforms; a background in Databricks is highly valued.
Familiarity with NLP techniques is a plus, especially for customer segmentation and categorisation tasks.
Ability to wear multiple hats and thrive in a startup environment where flexibility and initiative are key.
Proficiency in German is plus.




🛠️ The tools you will be using

Python
PySpark
Databricks
MLFlow
Model Serving Technologies
CI/CD Tools (e.g., Jenkins, Git)
Cloud Platforms (AWS)
Data Engineering Tools (Apache Spark, DBT)

We're making Africa the first cashless continent.

In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.

We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.

What We Do At Plato

Plato is building the digital backbone of the global trade economy. Starting with the $48T wholesale industry, we empower the modern wholesaler to connect their people and data in a single analytics and workflow hub. By leveraging data science and AI, we automate workflows and combat labor shortages, making SMB wholesalers competitive with large corporations.

Why We Do What We Do

The future of wholesale is data-driven. Unlike popular opinion, Industrial SMEs are ready to make the step to become more proactive in their processes but lack the technology to steer them to success. Our founders come from a wholesale family and gathered a rock star team of ex-Big Tech, VC, and top-tier consulting companies to reshape the operations of this $48tn industry. Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.

AI is transforming everything, and we make sure the right people are ahead of the curve. We do so by creating AI breakthroughs with our clients.




For us, creating breakthroughs is an irresistible adventure that we want to do 1000 times over. That’s why we are called One Thousand. And as a profitable, fast-growing company, we are on track as never before!




To create AI breakthroughs, our team of 15 friendly nerds identifies pain points and solves them with fast-paced MVPs. And: We enable the broader transformation of our clients into an AI powerhouse.




If you are keen to help Europe finally speed up in AI and would love to have warm outliers around you, join us now! We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer (m/w/d) who identifies with most of the following:




What we care about

Inherent Drive for Greatness: Our world-class team of outliers ships AI breakthroughs extremely fast while ensuring quality standards are met. We are people who feel like they still have something to prove – and we do so by working on something 1000x greater than us.
Relentless Resourcefulness: Creating AI breakthroughs requires the ability to thrive in uncertainty. We have the strength to bounce back and a tenacity to keep pushing to go where it hurts. We balance persistence with lightness.
Infectious Enthusiasm: We care about making AI a blast for everyone involved. With electrifying empathy, we propel our clients forward in understanding, building, and thriving with AI and boost our team with the opportunity to shape our future.




What the role is about

You will have the chance to shape fast-paced AI breakthrough projects. You will ensure our Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) are productionized as MVPs to generate business value.
You will be responsible for building data pipelines, running ML workflows, developing web services, deploying them on cloud environments, and supporting integration with our clients’ systems.
You will be a key contributor in growing our high-impact start-up and shaping our identity – both internally and externally.
You will be working not only with corporates but also be bringing AI to large international NGOs, the “Mittelstand,” scale-ups, unions, or the public sector.
You will have the chance to fully be yourself and will be embraced if you respect the others :-)




What we would love to see

Knowing how to execute real-life software projects: You have at least 3 years of experience in building scalable software projects in a professional manner.
Leveraging AI Expertise: You have hands-on experience implementing machine learning models in production environments, including model training, deployment, and monitoring. You are proficient with machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn) and understand the full ML lifecycle, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and optimization. You thrive on solving practical ML problems and are comfortable working within a team to deliver impactful solutions.
Bringing technical depth: You can solve diverse software engineering challenges with a flexible toolbox and love fostering good quality code. You have a strong foundation in Python and SQL. Besides that, you have experience with setting up secure web applications (e.g., working with SSL certificates). You bring experience with RDBMS (preferably PostgreSQL) and with at least one cloud platform (preferably, Microsoft Azure), too.
Being dedicated: You don't have to master everything, yet you fully support the team to reach our goals in a result-oriented way of working while fostering a culture of caring.
Dealing with ambiguity: Even if some challenges are vaguely defined, you make sense of what needs to be done.




Ideally, you also bring the following

Ability to communicate in German with level B2 or higher.
Experience with data science tools (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, ...).
Experience working with LLMs (OpenAI / Claude API).
Experience in building front-end solutions.
Experience with Docker.
Experience integrating web services with SAP.
Openness to travel to clients location 2-3 times a month.




What we offer

Ascension – as we are going to push and enable you to do the best work of your life.
Anti-Mimeticism – as we are on the journey to 1000 AI breakthroughs since long before the recent hype.
Captivating AI breakthrough projects with a lot of room for personal development, experimentation, continuous learning, and growth.
A unique role in a pioneering AI company with autonomy in shaping and leading key endeavors that contribute to the advancement of AI applications.
A professional, yet flexible work environment, innovative work practices along “No rules rules,” and continuous mutual support.
A value-driven business with top-of-market pay for a Machine Learning Engineer.
All the other start-up stuff such as free drinks and snacks, game nights, ...




We are determined to foster and embrace diversity – not just among our clients but especially within our own walls. We believe that this will make our organisation and quality of work better, but more importantly, we strongly believe it is the right thing to do.




Sounds like a “wow” opportunity? You would like to get to know us and the One Thousand better? Great – we can’t wait to hear from you! Please apply via LinkedIn.

We're making Africa the first cashless continent.

In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.

We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.

Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in.....

Build and apply machine learning models to improve product features and to analyze heterogeneous treatment effects (e.g. using random forests and related methods).
Take ownership of the analytics process - from project scoping and design through communicating findings to stakeholders.


Key Details


You can work remotely from anywhere (between UTC -5 and +2) with reliable internet access.
You’re willing to travel to one of our key markets once per year for ~6 days (Wave covers all costs). We also provide a yearly stipend of $800 to meet with coworkers.
Our salaries are competitive and are calculated using a transparent formula. For this role, depending on your level, we offer a competitive base salary, plus a generous equity package.

Our founders come from a wholesale family and gathered a rock star team of ex-Big Tech, VC, and top-tier consulting companies to reshape the operations of this $48tn industry. Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.

We are not working with recruiters on this role !

Sequel is a community of the world's best athletes investing in the world's best startups, making a positive impact.

We are on a mission to help athletes build legacies for their families and for the world.

We are a seed-stage company founded and backed by experienced serial entrepreneurs with several successful exits.

What You Will Be Working On


Implement tools that surface trends in the investment world
Strengthen our data-driven methods of identifying startups
Create tools that let us apply the data insights you generate



We are here to win - not just to take part. Just like our clients who operate at the elite level of sport, we understand that in order to win; we need to put in the work. This means going the extra mile, being willing to do what others will not and holding ourselves to a higher standard. Some companies play to not lose, we play to win. We are proactive, decisive and have the courage to take risks.

We pay it forward - we are always helpful. To customers, to partners and most importantly to each other. Not because it will ‘pay back', because it's the right thing to do.

We are adaptable - we understand in a world that is changing faster than ever before - the only constant is change. The average lifespan of a Fortune 100 company in 1958 was 61 years, now it is 18 years. We adapt to a changing world, constantly iterating, moving forward and staying relevant.

Yes first - we are on a mission to build something which has never been done before from the ground up. It will be a hard journey full of challenges which are currently unsolved. Our culture is defined by the fact that when we are confronted with challenges, we work from the assumption that it is possible to overcome them.

We are transparent - we challenge each other. Regardless of title, seniority or reporting lines. We give feedback and we are hungry to receive it. We value honest feedback delivered with kindness, and we value people who ask questions.

We always trust, respect and care for each other - it's no easy feat working in a startup, let alone one with goals as ambitious as ours. At sequel we believe no one is ever too busy to support fellow team members and that we should always be helpful, inclusive and selfless in the way we work. Diversity of background and thought is celebrated as we respect and appreciate what makes us all different. We don't tolerate free riders, egos or workplace politics.

What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?



The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Requirements



A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)
Experience conducting A/B experiments
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Responsibilities:


Leverage data and analytic frameworks to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency
Partner with product managers, engineers, marketers, designers, and operators to translate data insights into decisions and action
Construct and fit statistical, machine learning, or optimization models
Design and analyze online experiments; communicate results and act on launch decisions
Develop analytical frameworks to monitor business and product performance
Establish metrics that measure the health of our products, the business, as well as the driver experience


Experience:


Degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, economics, applied math, operations research or engineering (advanced degrees preferred), or relevant work experience
3+ years of industry experience in a data science, analytics, or management consulting role.
End-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, analysis, and visualization
Ability to manage, influence, negotiate, and inspire others in a fast-moving environment

Lyft also strives for a healthy and safe workplace and strictly prohibits harassment of any kind. Accommodation for persons with disabilities will be provided upon request in accordance with applicable law during the application and hiring process.

Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team.

You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Contently. Have you got what it takes?

Content marketing platforms are facing unprecedented challenges: scaling content creation, optimizing for ever-changing data, and improving ROI are harder than ever. Despite the promise of AI, many solutions out there only scratch the surface, offering generic models that don’t quite address the complex needs of content marketing teams. This means wasted time, underutilized resources, and missed growth opportunities for enterprises.

At Contently, we’re going beyond basic automation, using cutting-edge AI to solve deeply complex problems specific to content marketing, like how to intelligently recommend content, personalize campaigns, and boost engagement using LLMs. In this role, you will explore and implement AI solutions that directly change how global brands create, optimize, and measure their content strategies. It’s not just about developing features; it’s about transforming an industry.

This role is tailor-made for someone who craves technical challenge. You’ll not only be building end-to-end AI solutions—from writing custom algorithms and integrating machine learning models to deploying scalable cloud-based services—but you’ll also have the freedom to experiment with the latest AI technologies. You'll have access to vast datasets, the freedom to iterate fast, and a direct line to see the impact your work has on real users. If you're the kind of engineer who loves to experiment, push boundaries, and innovate in a way that directly impacts product direction, this is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for.

Join our team, where every line of code you write contributes to reshaping an industry. You’ll work alongside experts in AI, design, and product management, ensuring your innovations translate into features that make a measurable difference for users. If this sounds like your kind of challenge, we want to hear from you.
