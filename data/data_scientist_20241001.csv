About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

About The Consumer Data Science Team

Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists (Analytics) and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering team who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience that requires a good mix of technical and stakeholder engagement skills. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics or data science role. Data Scientists at Wolt take ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we're looking for someone like you.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland and Sweden. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
5+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent for product development (preferably consumer-facing).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

About the Team

The Marketing Analytics Team at Wolt focuses on solving marketing challenges and is tasked with optimising Wolt’s marketing mix through attribution, MMM, and Experimentation, enabling effective measurement of different marketing initiatives and working with the marketing team to identify areas for improvement and growth across all Wolt countries. Considering the scale of Wolt’s marketing function, there are many exciting problems to be solved and plenty of opportunities to make a business impact.

Data Scientists at Wolt work to uncover insights and turn them into relevant recommendations, driving decisions for the entire organisation. On the Marketing Analytics team we are focused on measuring the effectiveness of our marketing spend and optimising how we acquire and retain users.

Our team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics and data science skills to drive business outcomes, we're looking for someone like you.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Will…


Produce recommendations and use statistical techniques and hypothesis testing and other experimentation techniques to validate your findings
Provide insights to help business and product leaders understand marketplace dynamics, user behaviours, and long-term trends
Use quantitative analysis and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand what drives our business
Build full-cycle analytics experiments, reports, and dashboards using SQL, R, Python, or other scripting and statistical tools
Identify and measure levers to help move essential metrics and make recommendations
Possess excellent stakeholder management skills, know how to effectively collaborate well with strategy, operations, product, finance and engineering
Help our cross-functional teams use various data points to properly size the potential initiatives and opportunities
Work backwards from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions
Report against our goals by identifying essential metrics and building executive-facing dashboards to track progress
Act as mentors and guide the team towards actionable outcomes


Our humble expectations


At least 5 years of experience in data analytics, consulting, or related quantitative role
The ability to take ambiguous problems and solve them in a structured, hypothesis-driven, data-supported way
The determination to initiate and lead/own strategic projects to completion in a scrappy environment with a cross-functional team
Experience working with experimentation techniques (A/B testing, Causal Inference) and interpreting hypothesis testing
Proficiency in at least one programming language, preferably Python and/or R
Expertise with SQL queries, Basic ETL, Predictive modelling
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualisation tools (e.g. Looker, Tableau)
Clear and concise communication with strong cross-functional partnership experience
Drive measurement strategy for the area under scope, defining success metrics, and implementing best practices around experiment design and statistical analysis


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

About the Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has got Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

Over the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on identifying opportunities to resolve customer queries through automation & AI to decrease the need for human support and optimize the resolution time, building supporting KPIs & dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for product improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine product roadmap, automation & AI initiatives.

You're excited about this opportunity because you can:


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track the customer journey through the support, time to resolve queries, and other KPIs and advise on what we can do to improve.
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in event tracking and product analytics.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

We're making Africa the first cashless continent.

In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.

We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.

Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in.....

How you'll help us achieve it

Wave is now the largest financial institution in Senegal, with over 7 million users. And, we’re still in the early days of our product roadmap and potential impact on people’s everyday lives.

We’re looking for an expert in statistical analysis focused on Experimentation and Causal Inference to join the Growth team at Wave. In this role, you will design, run, and analyze experiments in collaboration with product and operations teams to improve the product and customer experience. The aim is to apply rigorous statistical methods of causal inference and machine learning to grow our user base and optimize product features.

In this role you will


Be embedded closely with our operations and product teams.
Generate insights using customer, merchant and agent data, which will include running power analyses, statistical modeling, and data visualization.
Design, implement and analyze experiments to evaluate the causal impact of new product features, promos, and operational process changes.
Design causal inference analysis plans using longitudinal data.
Explore large data sets to identify growth drivers and generate testable hypotheses.
Build and apply machine learning models to improve product features and to analyze heterogeneous treatment effects (e.g. using random forests and related methods).
Take ownership of the analytics process - from project scoping and design through communicating findings to stakeholders.


Key Details


You can work remotely from anywhere (between UTC -5 and +2) with reliable internet access.
You’re willing to travel to one of our key markets once per year for ~6 days (Wave covers all costs). We also provide a yearly stipend of $800 to meet with coworkers.
Our salaries are competitive and are calculated using a transparent formula. For this role, depending on your level, we offer a competitive base salary, plus a generous equity package.
We run performance reviews twice a year and award bonuses or promotions to strong performers who have been with the company for more than six months.
Major benefits:
Subsidized health insurance for you and your dependents and retirement contributions (both vary from country to country).
6 months of fully paid parental leave and subsidized fertility assistance.
Flexible vacation, with most folks taking between 30-40 days per year.
$10,000 annual charitable donation matching.

Requirements


Education and Experience

Cherry Ventures is supporting our portfolio with this hire.

Berlin based - m/f/d - full-time

What We Do At Plato

Plato is building the digital backbone of the global trade economy. Starting with the $48T wholesale industry, we empower the modern wholesaler to connect their people and data in a single analytics and workflow hub. By leveraging data science and AI, we automate workflows and combat labor shortages, making SMB wholesalers competitive with large corporations.

Why We Do What We Do

The future of wholesale is data-driven. Unlike popular opinion, Industrial SMEs are ready to make the step to become more proactive in their processes but lack the technology to steer them to success. Our founders come from a wholesale family and gathered a rock star team of ex-Big Tech, VC, and top-tier consulting companies to reshape the operations of this $48tn industry. Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.

What We’re Looking For

MLOps = DataOps + DevOps + ModelOps

At Plato, we are building a real-time data platform. As a member of our team, you will play a pivotal role in developing and maintaining the infrastructure that powers our ML solutions.

A significant challenge we face is onboarding a large number of customers onto our platform, where automation and repeatability are crucial for success. This role combines the best of data engineering with the demands of machine learning operations, ensuring the seamless operation of data pipelines and ML models from development to production.

The ideal candidate is an innovative problem-solver who is passionate about both data engineering and MLOps. You will thrive in our dynamic startup environment, wearing multiple hats when required to meet our evolving needs. Your ability to collaborate across teams, automate processes, and ensure repeatability will be key to driving our data and ML infrastructure forward.

What You’d Be Working On


Design, develop, and manage scalable and robust data pipelines that support machine learning models in production.
Implement and maintain CI/CD pipelines for data and ML workflows, ensuring smooth transitions from development to production.
Automate the onboarding process for new customers, ensuring scalability and repeatability across deployments.
Collaborate with data scientists and AI Engineers to optimize and automate data processing and model deployment.
Ensure the seamless integration of ML models with production environments, enabling real-time and batch inference capabilities.
Develop and maintain tools and frameworks for automated data management, model retraining, and monitoring.
Utilize MLFlow for model tracking, versioning, and lifecycle management.
Implement model serving solutions to deploy and manage real-time inference pipelines.
Work closely with our product, engineering, and data science teams to build and maintain a data platform that scales with our growing customer base.
Establish and enforce best practices for data and ML pipeline versioning, experimentation, and reproducibility.



What You Bring Along


3+ years of experience in data engineering, ML Engineering or a related field, with a strong focus on MLOps.
Experience in building and managing data pipelines that feed into machine learning models.
Very good knowledge of Python; experience with PySpark is appreciated.
Hands-on experience with data engineering tools and platforms; a background in Databricks is highly valued.
Experience with MLFlow for model tracking and lifecycle management.
Familiarity with model serving technologies and deploying models for real-time inference.
Familiarity with CI/CD tools and processes, including Jenkins, Git, or similar.
Ability to wear multiple hats and thrive in a startup environment where flexibility and initiative are key.
A mindset that embraces continuous improvement, automation, and scalability, particularly in customer onboarding and deployment processes.



The tools you will be using


Python
PySpark
Databricks
MLFlow
Model Serving Technologies
CI/CD Tools (e.g., Jenkins, Git)
Cloud Platforms (AWS)
Data Engineering Tools (Apache Spark, DBT)

Dann bist du bei uns genau richtig!




KI verändert die Welt, und wir sorgen dafür, dass die passenden Menschen diesen Wandel aktiv mitgestalten. Dafür setzen wir mit unseren Kunden innovative KI-Projekte um, die echten Mehrwert schaffen.




Für uns ist jeder KI-Durchbruch ein Abenteuer, das wir immer wieder erleben möchten – 1000-mal, um genau zu sein. Daher auch unser Name: One Thousand. Als profitables und schnell wachsendes Unternehmen sind wir auf dem besten Weg, diese Vision Realität werden zu lassen.




Unser Team aus 15 motivierten Nerds entdeckt die Probleme unserer Kunden und löst sie im Handumdrehen durch MVPs. Wir helfen unseren Kunden, selbst zu KI-Leadern zu werden.




Du brennst dafür, Europas KI-Entwicklung voranzubringen, und fühlst dich in einem Umfeld voller begeisterter Individualisten wohl? Dann suchen wir dich als Machine Learning Engineer (m/w/d), der sich mit den folgenden Punkten identifizieren kann:




Was uns wichtig ist




Streben nach Exzellenz: Unser erstklassiges Team entwickelt bahnbrechende KI-Lösungen im Rekordtempo und dabei immer mit höchstem Qualitätsanspruch. Wir sind Menschen, die Großes erreichen wollen – und das tun wir, indem wir an etwas arbeiten, das 1000-mal größer ist als wir selbst.

Unerschöpfliche Lösungsorientierung: Um KI-Durchbrüche zu erzielen, braucht es die Fähigkeit, in unklaren Situationen Lösungen zu finden. Mit Ausdauer, Flexibilität und Leichtigkeit navigieren wir auch durch unsicheres Terrain.

Begeisterung, die ansteckt: Wir setzen alles daran, dass KI für alle Beteiligten Freude bereitet. Mit Empathie treiben wir nicht nur unsere Kunden, sondern auch unser Team an und gestalten gemeinsam unsere Zukunft.




Deine Aufgaben bei uns




- Du gestaltest spannende und schnelle KI-Projekte, bei denen du sicherstellst, dass unsere Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) zu produktionsreifen MVPs weiterentwickelt werden, die echten Business-Wert schaffen.

- Du entwickelst Datenpipelines, setzt ML-Workflows um, baust Webservices, kümmerst dich um Cloud-Deployments und unterstützt die Integration in die Systeme unserer Kunden.

- Du trägst maßgeblich dazu bei, unser wachsendes Start-up zu stärken und prägst dabei unsere Identität – sowohl nach innen als auch nach außen.

- Du arbeitest nicht nur mit großen Unternehmen, sondern bringst auch KI-Lösungen für NGOs, Mittelstand, Scale-ups, Gewerkschaften und den öffentlichen Sektor voran.

- Du hast die Möglichkeit, dich voll einzubringen und wirst in einem respektvollen Umfeld so akzeptiert, wie du bist :-)




Was wir uns wünschen




- Erfahrung in Softwareprojekten: Du bringst mindestens 3 Jahre Erfahrung in der professionellen Entwicklung skalierbarer Softwareprojekte mit.

- KI-Expertise: Du hast praktische Erfahrung mit der Implementierung von ML-Modellen in Produktionsumgebungen – von Modelltraining über Deployment bis Monitoring. Du kennst dich mit ML-Frameworks (z.B. TensorFlow, PyTorch oder scikit-learn) aus und verstehst den kompletten ML-Lebenszyklus. Du bist stark darin, praxisnahe ML-Probleme zu lösen und arbeitest gerne im Team, um wirkungsvolle Lösungen zu entwickeln.

- Technische Tiefe: Du meisterst eine Vielzahl von Softwareentwicklungs-Herausforderungen mit einer vielseitigen Tool-Box und achtest auf sauberen Code. Ein solides Fundament in Python und SQL ist für dich selbstverständlich, ebenso wie Erfahrung mit sicheren Webanwendungen (z.B. SSL-Zertifikate), RDBMS (bevorzugt PostgreSQL) und mindestens einer Cloud-Plattform (bevorzugt Microsoft Azure).

- Engagement: Auch wenn du nicht in allem ein Experte bist, stehst du voll und ganz hinter deinem Team und arbeitest zielorientiert, um gemeinsam erfolgreich zu sein.

- Souveränität im Umgang mit Unklarheiten: Auch wenn Herausforderungen ungenau definiert sind, erkennst du schnell, was es braucht, um Lösungen zu finden.




Idealerweise bringst du außerdem mit




- Deutschkenntnisse auf mindestens B2-Niveau.

- Erfahrung mit Data-Science-Tools (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, ...).

- Erfahrung im Umgang mit LLMs (z.B. OpenAI, Claude API).

- Erfahrung im Aufbau von Frontend-Lösungen.

- Kenntnisse in Docker.

- Erfahrung in der Integration von Webservices mit SAP.

- Bereitschaft zu gelegentlichen Reisen (2-3 Mal im Monat).




Was wir dir bieten




- Persönliche Entwicklung: Wir setzen alles daran, dich zu fördern und dir zu ermöglichen, die beste Arbeit deines Lebens zu leisten.

- Pioniergeist: Wir sind auf dem Weg zu 1000 KI-Durchbrüchen – und das schon lange vor dem aktuellen Hype.

- Spannende Projekte: Arbeite an hochkarätigen KI-Projekten mit viel Raum für persönliche Entwicklung, Experimente, kontinuierliches Lernen und Wachstum.

- Zentrale Rolle: Eine besondere Position in einem führenden KI-Unternehmen, in der du autonom Schlüsselprojekte gestalten und leiten kannst, die zur Weiterentwicklung von KI-Anwendungen beitragen.

- Professionelles Arbeitsumfeld: Eine professionelle, aber flexible Arbeitskultur, innovative Methoden entlang des Prinzips „No rules rules“ und kontinuierliche gegenseitige Unterstützung.

- Attraktive Vergütung: Wir bieten eine marktführende Bezahlung für Machine Learning Engineers.

- Start-up-Atmosphäre: Und natürlich alle anderen Start-up-Vorteile wie kostenlose Getränke und Snacks, Spieleabende, ...




Wir sind fest entschlossen, Vielfalt zu fördern und zu leben – nicht nur bei unseren Kunden, sondern vor allem auch in unserem Team. Wir sind überzeugt, dass uns dies sowohl als Organisation als auch in der Qualität unserer Arbeit bereichert, aber vor allem ist es für uns einfach das Richtige.

We are to create a new standard for business payments and have made it our mission to simplify the purchasing experience for all businesses making it a tool for growth. Our solutions are based on proprietary, machine-learning-supported risk models, fully digitized processes and a highly scalable tech platform. This makes us a deep-tech company building financial products, not the other way around. We love building simple and elegant solutions and we strive for automation and scalability.

About The Role

Billie’s Analytics team is at the heart of the company supporting multiple functions to make data-driven decisions. The Analytics team works closely with all Product segments, and other departments by innovating, hypothesizing, strategizing and providing recommended actions to relevant stakeholders (Decision Science, Business Development and Account Management, Collection and Underwriting teams, Customer support and Marketing) in an integrated, scalable, secure and compliant way to enable the company's sustainable growth.

We are looking for a Data Scientist to join Billie’s Analytics team and contribute to the development and enhancement of Billie’s analytical capabilities.

In this role, you will have the chance to make a significant impact by leveraging data and analytics tools, will look for solutions, establish relationships to be able to guide business decisions within the company values and expectations, and contribute to the ongoing growth of our portfolio.

As a Data Scientist at Billie, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems.

This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience that requires a good mix of technical and stakeholder engagement skills. As part of the Analytics team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, owning the business outcome, rather than just doing yet another analytics or data science role.

This is a unique opportunity for data scientists who are eager to immerse themselves in the heart of the fintech business, develop additional muscles, and grow within a fast-paced and dynamic environment. You will collaborate with cross-functional teams, apply creative problem-solving skills, and drive business growth through data-driven strategies.

What will you do?


Perform analysis to develop a deep understanding of the product, and its usage, business processes, and to support business and research hypotheses, including A/B testing of product ideas, identifying new product and business opportunities
Find patterns in huge amounts of data
Support product segments in asking the right questions and creating efficient solutions that deliver positive results
Design data models as part of data solution to support reporting and analysis needs
Perform comprehensive data analysis and EDA to support Risk and Fraud systems optimization
Build ML models to solve real business problems, and work closely with MLOps and Engineering teams to bring them live

Communicate issues in an independent and timely manner with appropriate internal and external partners


Who We Are Looking For


You have 5+ years of proven experience in data science, data engineering or quantitative analytics
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent
Proven track record of managing complex initiatives with strong emphasis on data, providing actionable insights and tracking success of those initiatives
Able to communicate complex problems in a simple and relevant manner at all levels
Experience with translating analytical insights into data driven business prioritization

We are here to win - not just to take part. Just like our clients who operate at the elite level of sport, we understand that in order to win; we need to put in the work. This means going the extra mile, being willing to do what others will not and holding ourselves to a higher standard. Some companies play to not lose, we play to win. We are proactive, decisive and have the courage to take risks.

We pay it forward - we are always helpful. To customers, to partners and most importantly to each other. Not because it will ‘pay back', because it's the right thing to do.

We are adaptable - we understand in a world that is changing faster than ever before - the only constant is change. The average lifespan of a Fortune 100 company in 1958 was 61 years, now it is 18 years. We adapt to a changing world, constantly iterating, moving forward and staying relevant.

Yes first - we are on a mission to build something which has never been done before from the ground up. It will be a hard journey full of challenges which are currently unsolved. Our culture is defined by the fact that when we are confronted with challenges, we work from the assumption that it is possible to overcome them.

We are transparent - we challenge each other. Regardless of title, seniority or reporting lines. We give feedback and we are hungry to receive it. We value honest feedback delivered with kindness, and we value people who ask questions.

We always trust, respect and care for each other - it's no easy feat working in a startup, let alone one with goals as ambitious as ours. At sequel we believe no one is ever too busy to support fellow team members and that we should always be helpful, inclusive and selfless in the way we work. Diversity of background and thought is celebrated as we respect and appreciate what makes us all different. We don't tolerate free riders, egos or workplace politics.

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Contently. Have you got what it takes?

Content marketing platforms are facing unprecedented challenges: scaling content creation, optimizing for ever-changing data, and improving ROI are harder than ever. Despite the promise of AI, many solutions out there only scratch the surface, offering generic models that don’t quite address the complex needs of content marketing teams. This means wasted time, underutilized resources, and missed growth opportunities for enterprises.

At Contently, we’re going beyond basic automation, using cutting-edge AI to solve deeply complex problems specific to content marketing, like how to intelligently recommend content, personalize campaigns, and boost engagement using LLMs. In this role, you will explore and implement AI solutions that directly change how global brands create, optimize, and measure their content strategies. It’s not just about developing features; it’s about transforming an industry.

This role is tailor-made for someone who craves technical challenge. You’ll not only be building end-to-end AI solutions—from writing custom algorithms and integrating machine learning models to deploying scalable cloud-based services—but you’ll also have the freedom to experiment with the latest AI technologies. You'll have access to vast datasets, the freedom to iterate fast, and a direct line to see the impact your work has on real users. If you're the kind of engineer who loves to experiment, push boundaries, and innovate in a way that directly impacts product direction, this is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for.

Join our team, where every line of code you write contributes to reshaping an industry. You’ll work alongside experts in AI, design, and product management, ensuring your innovations translate into features that make a measurable difference for users. If this sounds like your kind of challenge, we want to hear from you.

What You Will Be Doing


Developing and implementing AI-driven features and tools to enhance our content marketing platform
Conducting experiments and exploring new AI technologies, including LLMs, to identify potential applications for Contently


Artificial Intelligence Engineer Key Responsibilities

Basic Requirements


At least 5 years of experience as a software developer
Professional experience coding in Python and Ruby-on-Rails
Advanced generative AI proficiency (i.e., use of multiple AI tools, ability to automate workflows and custom GPTs); if you've only used LLMs for research, learning, brainstorming, or content generation, that will be deemed insufficient
Prior experience managing technical product lifecycles, from ideation to deployment

You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.
