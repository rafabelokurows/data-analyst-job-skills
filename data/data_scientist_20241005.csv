Our goal is to make it easier for businesses to work together. Since 2018, we have been a leading disruptor in the business identity market. While consumer identity technology has seen significant modernization and digitization over the past decade, business identity and verification largely continues to be a manual process, specifically in the context of onboarding businesses to receive access to financial products and services. Our best-in-class business identity platform provides access to complete, up-to-date information that financial services institutions and fintechs need to make educated decisions about their customers and facilitate rapid onboarding and transacting. Our vision is that every company can instantly gain access to all the data, products, and services they need to establish and grow their business with ease. Middesk came out of Y Combinator, is backed by Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners, and was recently named to Forbes Fintech 50 List and cited as an industry leader in business verification by digital identity strategy firm, Liminal.

The Role

Middesk is, at its core, a data company. We live and die by the quality of our data asset and the engine that powers it. Data Science plays a pivotal role in building, maintaining, and leveraging both the data asset and engine. As a Data Scientist, you are responsible for what differentiates Middesk.

We are looking for an individual to grow, develop, and define what the ""data scientist"" role will look like at Middesk for the years to come. As one of the founding Data Scientists, you will have the opportunity to both build and lead.

You will be responsible for building 0-1 and big-data-scale Data Products that our customers and stakeholders use to inform and productionize their most critical decisions. Data Products include, but are not limited to, data models and ETL pipelines, reporting dashboards, business and product impact sizing, decision/ROI/trade-off frameworks, ML-based classification and scoring models, fine-tuned foundation models.

What You'll Do:


Build and improve systems and tools (e.g. our core Entity Resolution engine and Experimentation Platform) that make our Business Identity data asset best-in-class.
Implement solutions to derive unique and impactful insights from the most comprehensive Business Identity dataset in the US.
Design and shape strategies to build proprietary datasets that will differentiate our Business Verification and Risk products and unlock new customer use cases.
Play a critical role in scaling our Data Science function - shaping our culture, processes, and identity within the broader Middesk team.


What We’re Looking For:


3+ years of professional working experience in a data science / machine-learning engineer role.
Top-notch analytical skills to go deep, break down, and solve complex, ambiguous problems.
Technically proficient in uncovering insights and building data products that leverage these insights.
Proven ability to collaborate and lead cross-functionally.
Excellent written and oral communication skills.
Full-stack Data Scientist with a spike in Algorithms/ML/Engineering but can stretch across Analytics and Analytics Engineering domains when needed.
Great business judgment with the ability to effectively reason and prioritize from first-principles.

Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article. Please exercise caution and cease communications if something feels suspicious about your interactions.
