Work digital-first for your daily work



About The Role

These systems already impact many aspects of our lives and will continue to grow in their influence over the next two decades. Therefore, ensuring the reliability, safety, security, fairness, and understandability of these systems is critical. To date, tools to ensure that AI-powered systems meet these standards have lagged behind the tools used to develop them. This has led to two common outcomes: deployment of AI-powered systems without proper verification and validation, or conversely, failure to deploy a system after costly development time and resources due to a lack of trust in the system by stakeholders.

This is where CalypsoAI comes in. We are building a suite of products and tools to facilitate the deployment of trustworthy AI by focusing on rigorous verification and validation testing.

We are looking for a Data Scientist to join our growing team. As a key member of the Data Science team, you will work alongside other data scientists, software engineers, and product owners to research, design, and develop new features that support the development of trustworthy AI for our customers. In this role, you will be required to read and contribute to cutting-edge developments in adversarial machine learning, ML bias and fairness, model staleness, and many other fascinating areas of research. You will read the latest papers and distill their core concept into product features and product direction.

Duties And Responsibilities


Actively extend and improve our core software libraries by writing and reviewing code
Work closely with the engineering team to integrate new features into existing products
Contribute to the research, development, and technical design of new product features
Develop novel tests around the security, reliability, and robustness of ML models

Required Knowledge, Skills, And Abilities


Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field (statistics, economics, computer science, etc.)
Familiarity with software development practices and tools (code review, Git, etc.)
Comfortable with multiple scientific computing libraries (pandas, sklearn, numpy, scipy)
Familiarity with at least one deep learning framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras)
Python programming experience (open source or product-oriented professional setting)
Practical experience with multiple supervised ML tasks
Excellent interpersonal and communication skills


Preferred Qualifications


Deep experience in at least one area leveraging tabular data (e.g. causal inference, missing data imputation, time series analysis, bayesian statistics, etc.) demonstrated via a publication, thesis (MS or PhD), or public project (code and/or write up)
Practical experience with model lifecycle: development, deployment, and monitoring
Advanced degree in a quantitative field or relevant professional experience


Why join us...


To start with: we at CalypsoAI are building the first-ever security for AI solution!
If that's not enough: We are a fast-growing startup meaning we have great opportunities to grow within the company!
Endless opportunities to learn from our inspirational, talented team members
You will never be bored at work again if you join us!

About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

About The Consumer Data Science Team

Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists (Analytics) and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering team who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience that requires a good mix of technical and stakeholder engagement skills. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics or data science role. Data Scientists at Wolt take ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we're looking for someone like you.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland and Sweden. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
5+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent for product development (preferably consumer-facing).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

Do you like to create insights and turn them into action to create lasting impact? We are searching for an experienced Data Scientist for our Data & AI team to support our clients by combining business sense with data modelling. If this description fits your profile, we are looking for you!

The Data & AI team at IG&H is using the latest data and AI technology to help our clients innovate. To do so, our team of 25 data experts works closely together with our Technology and Sector teams. Through smart collaboration, we have delivered over 40 (Gen)AI projects in the last two years for our clients in Retail, Healthcare and Financial Services. As a Data Scientist, you will play a central role in truly understanding our client’s needs, translating this into value, creating solutions, developing Gen(AI) models and turning them into action. We believe it is key to have business sense as well as broad experience with data related topics (analytics, artificial intelligence, etc.) to create real business value. On top of that, you need to be able to communicate clearly and convincingly. Not only for effective project execution, but also to inspire (internal) stakeholders on the latest trends and developments in the field of Data and AI.

You will typically work in multidisciplinary project teams for one project at a time. Although being able to deliver work independently is appreciated, involvement of a project manager and technical experts ensures high-quality delivery and facilitates you to maintain a steep learning curve. We believe in diverse teams and diverse profiles in our Data & AI team. Some of our Data Scientists develop to be great consultants with technical knowledge and execution power, while others focus more on gaining deep technical expertise to deliver value from there. Working on a different range of projects in different sectors, you’ll be able to find your own sweet spot.

In addition, we believe that a caring and fun working environment will help you to dare to step out of your comfort zone and learn. We offer continuous learning through the IG&H Academy, in which you will get trainings to boost your data science, consulting and people skills. Also, you will be assigned a mentor, who will be there for you to provide you with guidance.

Above all, people are at the heart of what we do. This of course comes back in the work we deliver for our clients (why make a data product if the people who need to use it do not understand or want to use it?). At the same time, a fun working culture is key for who we are. With an inspiring office in Utrecht where we can connect, have abundant parties, team activities and sport events (both organized for the entire IG&H organization as well as specifically for the Data & Analytics team), IG&H is truly a Great Place To Work. And yes, we are certified!

Working for the Data & AI Team at IG&H Consulting is incredibly diverse, and fun at the same time. It’s been a great place to develop my technical know-how, management consulting skills and commercial effectivity. The team is young and ambitious, with a strong desire to solve complex puzzles, develop personally & professionally and do fun activities together. All in all, IG&H has been a great place to work for over 6 years already!

We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Most importantly, we seek people who are excited about crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who You Are


You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.


Data Science is an integral component of Coinbase’s product and decision making process: we work in partnership with Product, Engineering and Design to influence the roadmap and better understand our users. With a deep expertise in experimentation, analytics and advanced modeling, we produce insights which directly move the company’s bottom line.

What You'll Be Doing


Perform analyses on products to answer open-ended questions and provide strategic recommendations.
Design and guide experiments/analysis to measure impact and drive product improvements.
Develop and maintain key metrics and reports, enhancing data infrastructure for better analysis.


What We Look For In You


At least a BA/BS in a quantitative field (ex Math, Stats, Physics, or Computer Science) with ≥2+ years of relevant experience.
Experience driving impact for a digital product with an iterative development cycle.
Understanding of statistical concepts and practical experience applying them (in A|B testing, causal inference, ML, etc.).
Experience in data analyses using SQL.
Experience in programming/modeling in Python.
Demonstration of our core cultural values: clear communication, positive energy, continuous learning, and efficient execution.

Verily is a subsidiary of Alphabet that is using a data-driven approach to change the way people manage their health and the way healthcare is delivered. Launched from Google X in 2015, our purpose is to bring the promise of precision health to everyone, every day. We are focused on generating and activating data from a variety of sources, including clinical, social, behavioral and the real world, to arrive at the best solutions for a person based on a comprehensive view of the evidence. Our unique expertise and capabilities in technology, data science and healthcare enable the entire healthcare ecosystem to drive better health outcomes.

Description

As a Data Scientist on our Registries and RWD (real-world data) team, you will be supporting our core mission to drive innovation in evidence generation for research and care decisions. We are building new types of longitudinal datasets that have foundations of RWD sources, such as EHRs (electronic health records) and claims data, and are augmented with prospective data collection. You will develop and deploy models that enable scalable curation of RWD. This will include multi-source integrations and reconciliations, creating derived features from the source data (e.g., abstraction of clinical concepts from unstructured data), and facilitating data quality assessments. You will work with a diverse cross-functional team to build reusable and scalable tools and to deliver products that unlock information from structured and unstructured clinical data.

Responsibilities


Work closely with cross-functional partners to design and create longitudinal datasets integrating multiple data sources.
Build and implement highly accurate machine learning models / AI tools using sparsely labeled healthcare datasets.
Implement, build on and augment existing LLM/NLP tools to maximize the value of using unstructured medical data across a range of research and care applications.
Become an expert in our data’s capabilities and limitations. Solve difficult, non-routine analysis problems, handling data challenges from a real-world setting.
Communicate technical methods and results clearly in well structured reports and presentations to a range of technical and non-technical audiences.


Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications


Advanced degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., data sciences, statistics, biomedical informatics, computer science, applied mathematics, or similar), or equivalent practical experience.
2+ years experience applying advanced machine learning and AI techniques (supervised and unsupervised methods, LLMs, NLP) to clinical data.
Direct experience working with and curating real-world data, such as EHR, including a deep understanding of the complexities of this structured and unstructured clinical data.
Strong proficiency in Python.


Preferred Qualifications


Familiarity with medical terminologies and ontologies.
Familiarity with software engineering practices and experience developing production software.
Experience working with clinical subject matter experts.
Ability to work cross-functionally on teams, with a tolerance for ambiguity.
Creative and methodical problem solving: understand needs, identify options, form hypotheses, generate robust results, make informed decisions, and learn faster through feedback.
