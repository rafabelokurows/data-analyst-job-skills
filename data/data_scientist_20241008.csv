About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

Who is Peppy?

Our mission is to fix healthcare & wellbeing. We do this by supporting the employees of our global clients, including JP Morgan, Disney, Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft, Sony, Clifford Chance, Wells Fargo, Bloomberg, and over 200 others.




Having already revolutionised the employee benefits sector with our innovative clinical products – such as the world’s first menopause benefit – we are now building the world’s most advanced benefits management platform. Think of us as a “Deel for Benefits” – a rocket-ship opportunity with a mission that truly matters. The global benefits sector encompasses employer-funded pensions, critical illness insurance, private healthcare insurance, and many other categories. This is a trillion-dollar TAM with weak, incumbent competition and almost no AI-first startups stepping up to the challenge.

Data-Driven Product Insights – Analyse user interaction data to generate insights that inform product improvements. Provide compelling data narratives to clients, illustrating the tangible benefits and value derived from the platform.
Algorithm Development – Develop and refine algorithms, such as search and recommender systems, within our new product platform. Focus on problem formulation, system design, and evaluation methodologies to enhance user experience and key business metrics.
Integration of Advanced AI Technologies – Work with cutting-edge technologies such as Large Language Models (LLM) and generative AI systems to innovate and expand the capabilities of our core technology.
Collaborative Product Development – Collaborate with the cross-functional R&D team to integrate technological advances into the platform. Ensure that data insights contribute effectively to product strategy and innovation.




Our dream Data Scientist will have:

A graduate degree in Machine Learning, Data Science, or a closely related field, demonstrating sound theoretical knowledge and practical application skills in advanced analytics and computational modelling.
At least 2 years of industry experience in roles such as Data Science, Business Analytics, or Analytics Engineering, with a proven track record of contributing to successful projects.
Demonstrated pragmatism to problem-solving, prioritising actionable solutions over theoretical perfection. Emphasises quick decision-making and results over extensive deliberation.
Excellent communication skills capable of articulating complex data-driven insights to both technical and non-technical audiences, enhancing understanding and decision-making across the company.
Demonstrated persistence and drive across different kinds of work, with an ability to effectively manage time-sensitive tasks.
An ability to thrive in fast-paced settings characterised by ambiguity and evolving requirements, seeing this challenge as an opportunity to influence team strategy and drive focus.
Capacity to work effectively within cross-functional teams, contributing to joint projects and sharing insights that help align data science activities with broader business objectives.
Appetite for learning the latest developments in data science and machine learning, actively seeking new knowledge and techniques that can enhance their work and the value they bring to the business.

We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We have a CEO and are ready to start building.

About Us

Untrap addresses a critical problem faced by Managed Service Providers (MSPs): the inability to fully understand the data contained in their own internal systems. This trapped data, often overlooked due to the limitations of existing reporting tools, holds significant potential for MSPs to enhance profitability, optimize operations, and improve client retention.

Untrap bridges this gap by providing actionable insights, improving operational efficiency, and ultimately enhancing profitability for MSPs.

Our mission is to unlock the valuable data trapped within these systems, transforming how MSPs operate and serve their clients.

As a Founding Engineer, you will play a pivotal role in shaping our product and company culture. You'll work directly with the founding team, tackling exciting technical challenges and building scalable solutions from the ground up.

Thales’ Applied AI Research Team in Canada is looking for a talented researcher with a great appetite to solve complex research questions and apply them to critical machine learning projects. The team aims to design and implement cutting-edge solutions by incorporating Data Science and Decision Making capabilities.

Principaux domaines de responsabilité

Un scientifique de recherche et technologie (R&T) en science de données et aide à la décision est chargé de découvrir, de réaliser et d'intégrer des concepts innovants en IA dans les solutions Thales. Il/elle prouve leur viabilité à travers la mise en œuvre de preuves de concepts et guide leur croissance en maturité à travers des prototypes et des démonstrateurs qui illustreront et permettront à leur tour leur plein potentiel commercial.

Pour réussir dans ce rôle, la curiosité pour ce qui est nouveau, la volonté de défier le statu quo, l'ouverture d'esprit et la pensée originale sont essentielles. L'individu doit rapidement apprendre et évaluer les nouvelles techniques et technologies afin de décider de les adopter, de les adapter ou de les abandonner. Il doit également être capable de proposer de nouvelles idées, de les présenter, de les questionner et de les améliorer en permanence. La personne doit posséder des compétences techniques approfondies et pratiques et être familière avec les outils et méthodes associés à la recherche opérationnelle. Le candidat doit démontrer une solide compréhension de la méthode scientifique et sa capacité à fournir un contenu de qualité à toutes les étapes du processus de recherche : de la capacité à résumer le contexte théorique d'un nouveau domaine jusqu’à la diffusion des résultats de la recherche par le biais de publications revues par les pairs, de brevets ou autres moyens.

Le scientifique fait partie d'une équipe pluridisciplinaire. Un fort esprit d'équipe et des capacités de travail d'équipe sont obligatoires. Le candidat idéal est donc en mesure de démontrer des compétences transversales qui faciliteraient le transfert du travail effectué à tous les intervenants impliqués. Il / elle contribuera en tant qu'expert technique aux projets de recherche et technologie de Thales et de ses unités commerciales. Par conséquent, de bonnes capacités de communication sont requises.

Responsibiliés du Scientifique en IA appliquée:


Effectuer des recherches et développer des algorithmes pour les systèmes critiques.
Concevoir et mettre en œuvre des modèles d'IA à grande échelle pour résoudre un grand nombre de problèmes complexes.
Publier les résultats de la recherche dans des conférences sur l'IA de premier plan et contribuer à la publication de brevets d'innovation.
Faire preuve de bonnes compétences en matière de communication avec les scientifiques, les ingénieurs et les parties prenantes.
Faire preuve de discernement dans le choix des méthodes et des techniques pour obtenir des solutions.
Collaborer avec des instituts universitaires ou de recherche (par exemple, CRSNG, MITACS, etc.), avec des partenaires industriels et avec des unités/équipes internes de Thales.
Proposer, collecter et synthétiser les exigences du système auprès des parties prenantes et créer des feuilles de route efficaces.



A Research and Technology (R&T) AI scientist in Data Science and Decision Making is responsible for discovering, enabling and integrating complex innovative AI concepts into Thales solutions. He/she proves their viability through the implementation of Proofs of Concept (PoCs) and guides their maturity growth through prototypes and demonstrators that will in turn illustrate and enable their full business potential.
