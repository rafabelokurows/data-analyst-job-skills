For entry level Job seekers to get client interviews and jobs they need to differentiate themselves by ensuring they have exceptional skills and technologies to be noticed by clients.

Since 2010 we have helped Jobseekers differentiate themselves by providing the clients with candidates who have the requisite skills and experience to outperform at interviews and clients. Here at SynergisticIT We just don't focus on getting you a Job we make careers.

All Positions are open for all visas and US citizens

We are matchmakers we provide clients with candidates who can perform from day 1 of starting work. In this economy no client wants or has the resources to take an entry level person and spend resources on upgrading their skills and on top of that pay the jobseeker. That's the specific reason there are so many techies both experience and freshers who are unemployed.

Clients have now the option to hire remote workers from anywhere so for a Jobseeker its important to introspect and see how they can become better and have the skills and technologies to meet client requirements.

We at Synergisticit understand the problem of the mismatch between employer's requirements and Employee skills and that's why since 2010 we have helped thousands of candidates get jobs at technology clients like apple, google, Paypal, western union, Client, visa, walmart labs etc to name a few.

We have an excellent reputation with the clients. Currently, We are looking for entry-level software programmers, Java Full stack developers, Python/Java developers, Data analysts/ Data Scientists, Machine Learning engineers for full time positions with clients.

For entry level Job seekers to get client interviews and jobs they need to differentiate themselves by ensuring they have exceptional skills and technologies to be noticed by clients.

Since 2010 we have helped Jobseekers differentiate themselves by providing the clients with candidates who have the requisite skills and experience to outperform at interviews and clients. Here at SynergisticIT We just don't focus on getting you a Job we make careers.

All Positions are open for all visas and US citizens

We are matchmakers we provide clients with candidates who can perform from day 1 of starting work. In this economy no client wants or has the resources to take an entry level person and spend resources on upgrading their skills and on top of that pay the jobseeker. That's the specific reason there are so many techies both experience and freshers who are unemployed.

Clients have now the option to hire remote workers from anywhere so for a Jobseeker its important to introspect and see how they can become better and have the skills and technologies to meet client requirements.

We at Synergisticit understand the problem of the mismatch between employer's requirements and Employee skills and that's why since 2010 we have helped thousands of candidates get jobs at technology clients like apple, google, Paypal, western union, Client, visa, walmart labs etc to name a few.

We have an excellent reputation with the clients. Currently, We are looking for entry-level software programmers, Java Full stack developers, Python/Java developers, Data analysts/ Data Scientists, Machine Learning engineers for full time positions with clients.

Who Should Apply Recent Computer science/Engineering /Mathematics/Statistics or Science Graduates looking to make their careers in IT Industry

We welcome candidates with all visas and citizens to apply.

We assist in filing for STEM extension and also for H1b and Green card filing to Candidates

We also offer optionally Skill and technology enhancement programs for candidates who are either missing skills or are lacking Industry/Client experience with Projects and skills. Candidates having difficulty in finding jobs or cracking interviews or who wants to improve their skill portfolio. If they are qualified with enough skills and have hands on project work at clients then you should be good to be submitted to clients. Shortlisting and selection is totally based on clients discretion not ours.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $136,000 - $230,000 per year.

By clicking “Submit Application”, I understand and agree that Notion and its affiliates and subsidiaries will collect and process my information in accordance with Notion’s Global Recruiting Privacy Policy.

Ability to develop a nuanced business understanding, testable hypotheses, and significant findings from data.
Ability to present data, actionable insights, technical concepts, and approaches to technical and non-technical audiences.

Curiosity about how things work, from both a business and technical perspective, could result in identifying and exploring new product opportunities, potential improvements to our data infrastructure, and deepening our understanding of member behavior.
Proactive collaborator skilled in engaging with cross-functional teams (Product, Engineering, Machine Learning) to influence decision-making, confidently voicing concerns and alternative perspectives
Ability to prioritize time across multiple projects and communicate timelines

We believe that more startups should exist and that founder-led companies are more successful in the long term. With Pulley's cap table management tools, companies can better understand and optimize their equity for the long term. Starting a company is hard enough. Managing equity shouldn't be.

We're a high-performing team looking for passionate, execution-focused, self-starters to help us build equity management tools for founders. Pulley is growing quickly with over 3000 customers including unicorns like Clubhouse, Birdies, and Coda - all within our first year of product launch.

Our trajectory is fueled by top investors like Founders' Fund, Stripe, General Catalyst, Caffeinated Capital, 8vc, Elad Gil, among other great angels. All of our growth has been organic, and we're growing the team to meet the demand.

🌟 AI Engineer

We're looking for a curious and motivated Software Engineer who is passionate about utilizing AI to build impactful solutions. You will play a critical role in automating internal tools to improve efficiency, and developing AI-powered applications to meet the needs of internal stakeholders and customers. In this cross-functional role, you'll have a unique opportunity to work closely with leadership, and tackle innovative projects that will directly impact how our business functions.

🛠 Responsibilities


Utilize AI/ML products to automate internal tools and build products that drive efficiency
Help manage the full product development lifecycle for new platform capabilities and product experiences end-to-end
Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to understand their needs and iterate on solutions


🙌 Qualifications & Fit


Strong software engineering skills, proficiency in Python
Deep interest in AI/ML technologies and the latest AI research, and familiarity with AI-powered developer tools like ChatGPT
Ability to work cross functionally with other teams


💚 Benefits

US based benefits:


Health, Dental, and Vision insurance
Unlimited PTO
401(k) Match


✨ Our Culture

TL&DR - Pulley is a unique fit, tailored for those who align with our values and culture. We are looking for people who are excited about building a great company, not just working in a high-growth startup. In addition to function-specific skills, here are some traits that enable our team members to thrive:


First Principles Thinking. We believe in breaking down problems into their most basic parts. We don't reject ideas because they haven't worked before. We understand ""why did certain things work?"" and apply it to our situation.
Ship It & Iterate. Shipping is the starting line for learning. Ship something, talk to users, get feedback, and iterate. We focus on the inputs, on what we can control, not the outcomes. We take our best bets, and don't fixate on the finish line.
Boldly Honest & Aggressively Considerate. Being boldly honest means we push one another to act from first principles, set and hit goals, and ruthlessly prioritize. Being aggressively considerate means we care about each other as humans to win as a team. We speak up and embrace feedback.
Default Yes. We believe that something is possible unless proven otherwise. Hard problems are often solved by people who didn't know it was impossible.


We're also inspired by the culture work done at other companies and plan to develop our own playbook here too. One of the concepts that resonate most with us is the importance of stunning colleagues. If you like the sound of our environment and you're passionate about joining a team like the one we've described, we'd love to talk!

Annual Salary Range: $90,000—$125,000 USD, plus equity to be negotiated.

Who we are:

Shape a brighter financial future with us.

Together with our members, we’re changing the way people think about and interact with personal finance.

We’re a next-generation financial services company and national bank using innovative, mobile-first technology to help our millions of members reach their goals. The industry is going through an unprecedented transformation, and we’re at the forefront. We’re proud to come to work every day knowing that what we do has a direct impact on people’s lives, with our core values guiding us every step of the way. Join us to invest in yourself, your career, and the financial world.

The Role

We are seeking a full stack Senior Data Scientist who will help shape business strategy and product development decisions through data-driven insights. This is an exciting role for someone to make a direct impact on new product strategy and revenue of SoFi, supporting SoFi’s B2B business channel called SoFi At Work. The goal of this platform is to provide new ways for our partners to help their employees get their money right across every life stage.

Success in this role hinges on your technical aptitude, quantitative abilities, and business acumen: you know how to plow through data with SQL/Python/R/Tableau, surface insights using math/statistics/ML techniques, and measure the business impact using efficiency/conversion/profit metrics. You treat stakeholders as a partnership – you are there at each step of the way and you know that we only succeed if we succeed together.

This role

What you’ll do:



Work with amazing product and business managers to identify strategic opportunities, measure KPIs to craft compelling stories, make data-driven recommendations, and drive informed actions.
Craft, analyze, and present customer behavior metrics, such as funnel conversion, user churn, features engagement, product LTV, and cross-sell metrics. Work with product and marketing partners to design tests to improve these metrics.
Own end-to-end product analytics workflow including formulating success metrics, socializing them across the organization, and creating dashboards/reports.
Act as a curator of data by defining, instrumenting, and tracking necessary analytics of our products by working cross functionally with engineering and product teams.
Build self-service systems to enable others in the organization to leverage your work.
Analyze and perform statistical analysis on data that underlies product experiments.
Build models to help decision makers understand customer behaviors and segmentation
You stay focused on what’s best for the company – sometimes that requires being flexible, other times it requires being steadfast.



What you’ll need:



Bachelor’s degree required (Masters preferred) in Computer Science, Math, Physics, Engineering or quantitative field.
4+ years of relevant work experience
Intellectual curiosity and aptitude to pick up new technical skills
Exceptional problem-solving skills
Ability to initiate and drive projects to completion with minimal guidance
High EQ with ability to influence outcomes and communicate technical content to general audiences
Strong programming skills in SQL, Python and proficiency in Tableau
Experience with experimentation and hypothesis testing
Ability to work in a dynamic, cross-functional environment, with strong attention to detail
Strong relationship building and collaborative skills
Experience with using DBT/Airflow to build Data Pipelines in Snowflake

Our goal is to make it easier for businesses to work together. Since 2018, we have been a leading disruptor in the business identity market. While consumer identity technology has seen significant modernization and digitization over the past decade, business identity and verification largely continues to be a manual process, specifically in the context of onboarding businesses to receive access to financial products and services. Our best-in-class business identity platform provides access to complete, up-to-date information that financial services institutions and fintechs need to make educated decisions about their customers and facilitate rapid onboarding and transacting. Our vision is that every company can instantly gain access to all the data, products, and services they need to establish and grow their business with ease. Middesk came out of Y Combinator, is backed by Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners, and was recently named to Forbes Fintech 50 List and cited as an industry leader in business verification by digital identity strategy firm, Liminal.

The Role

Middesk is, at its core, a data company. We live and die by the quality of our data asset and the engine that powers it. Data Science plays a pivotal role in building, maintaining, and leveraging both the data asset and engine. As a Data Scientist, you are responsible for what differentiates Middesk.

We are looking for an individual to grow, develop, and define what the ""data scientist"" role will look like at Middesk for the years to come. As one of the founding Data Scientists, you will have the opportunity to both build and lead.

You will be responsible for building 0-1 and big-data-scale Data Products that our customers and stakeholders use to inform and productionize their most critical decisions. Data Products include, but are not limited to, data models and ETL pipelines, reporting dashboards, business and product impact sizing, decision/ROI/trade-off frameworks, ML-based classification and scoring models, fine-tuned foundation models.

What You'll Do:


Build and improve systems and tools (e.g. our core Entity Resolution engine and Experimentation Platform) that make our Business Identity data asset best-in-class.
Implement solutions to derive unique and impactful insights from the most comprehensive Business Identity dataset in the US.
Design and shape strategies to build proprietary datasets that will differentiate our Business Verification and Risk products and unlock new customer use cases.
Play a critical role in scaling our Data Science function - shaping our culture, processes, and identity within the broader Middesk team.


What We’re Looking For:


3+ years of professional working experience in a data science / machine-learning engineer role.
Top-notch analytical skills to go deep, break down, and solve complex, ambiguous problems.
Technically proficient in uncovering insights and building data products that leverage these insights.
Proven ability to collaborate and lead cross-functionally.
Excellent written and oral communication skills.
Full-stack Data Scientist with a spike in Algorithms/ML/Engineering but can stretch across Analytics and Analytics Engineering domains when needed.
Great business judgment with the ability to effectively reason and prioritize from first-principles.

These systems already impact many aspects of our lives and will continue to grow in their influence over the next two decades. Therefore, ensuring the reliability, safety, security, fairness, and understandability of these systems is critical. To date, tools to ensure that AI-powered systems meet these standards have lagged behind the tools used to develop them. This has led to two common outcomes: deployment of AI-powered systems without proper verification and validation, or conversely, failure to deploy a system after costly development time and resources due to a lack of trust in the system by stakeholders.

This is where CalypsoAI comes in. We are building a suite of products and tools to facilitate the deployment of trustworthy AI by focusing on rigorous verification and validation testing.

We are looking for a Data Scientist to join our growing team. As a key member of the Data Science team, you will work alongside other data scientists, software engineers, and product owners to research, design, and develop new features that support the development of trustworthy AI for our customers. In this role, you will be required to read and contribute to cutting-edge developments in adversarial machine learning, ML bias and fairness, model staleness, and many other fascinating areas of research. You will read the latest papers and distill their core concept into product features and product direction.

Duties And Responsibilities


Actively extend and improve our core software libraries by writing and reviewing code
Work closely with the engineering team to integrate new features into existing products
Contribute to the research, development, and technical design of new product features

Familiarity with at least one deep learning framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras)
Python programming experience (open source or product-oriented professional setting)
Practical experience with multiple supervised ML tasks
Excellent interpersonal and communication skills


Preferred Qualifications


Deep experience in at least one area leveraging tabular data (e.g. causal inference, missing data imputation, time series analysis, bayesian statistics, etc.) demonstrated via a publication, thesis (MS or PhD), or public project (code and/or write up)
Practical experience with model lifecycle: development, deployment, and monitoring
Advanced degree in a quantitative field or relevant professional experience


Why join us...


To start with: we at CalypsoAI are building the first-ever security for AI solution!
