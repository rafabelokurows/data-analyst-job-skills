We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

At Bunkerhill, we are laser focused on helping researchers bring their algorithms to the clinic. To that end, we have launched a new initiative: to build a foundation model for medical imaging!

Today, when a researcher is interested in building an algorithm, they typically need to start from scratch (or use models pretrained on ImageNet) and train on a large quantity of data. To make this process faster and to lower the barrier to entry, we're building a foundation model that researchers can fine tune to build clinically-useful downstream algorithms.

The goal of this initiative is to enable researchers within the consortium to build robust, generalizable algorithms using much less data and then use the Bunkerhill Consortium to validate their algorithm, obtain regulatory clearance, and distribute it for clinical use!

Design, develop, and deploy machine learning algorithms and models, with a focus on Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques.
Define and operate batch processing pipelines.
Create and maintain user documentation to help researchers onboard their AI models.
Develop large deep learning models with self-supervised learning on multimodal data.
Communicate findings to other engineers, operators, and leadership.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to understand project requirements and translate them into technical solutions.
Conduct research to stay abreast of the latest advancements in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.
Optimize algorithms for performance, scalability, and efficiency, considering real-world deployment constraints.
Evaluate and validate models using appropriate metrics and datasets, ensuring robustness and reliability.
Mentor junior team members and contribute to knowledge sharing within the organization.


Requirements


Bachelor's, Master's, or Ph.D. degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, or related field.
3+ years of work professional work experience in a fast-paced, high-growth environment.
Experience in developing machine learning solutions, with a focus on Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
Experience with Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow or similar frameworks for machine learning. to train deep learning models with supervised learning.
Experience with cloud platforms (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure).
Experience with infrastructure-as-code tools (e.g. Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi) and CI/CD tooling (e.g. GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Circle CI, Jenkins) is a plus.


Benefits


Depending on your work location, the target annual salary for this position can range as detailed below. Full time offers from Bunkerhill Health also include + equity + benefits (including medical, dental, vision, commuter and 401(k)).


Pay Range:

$140,000—$240,000 USD

We believe that more startups should exist and that founder-led companies are more successful in the long term. With Pulley's cap table management tools, companies can better understand and optimize their equity for the long term. Starting a company is hard enough. Managing equity shouldn't be.

We're a high-performing team looking for passionate, execution-focused, self-starters to help us build equity management tools for founders. Pulley is growing quickly with over 3000 customers including unicorns like Clubhouse, Birdies, and Coda - all within our first year of product launch.

Our trajectory is fueled by top investors like Founders' Fund, Stripe, General Catalyst, Caffeinated Capital, 8vc, Elad Gil, among other great angels. All of our growth has been organic, and we're growing the team to meet the demand.

🌟 AI Engineer

We're looking for a curious and motivated Software Engineer who is passionate about utilizing AI to build impactful solutions. You will play a critical role in automating internal tools to improve efficiency, and developing AI-powered applications to meet the needs of internal stakeholders and customers. In this cross-functional role, you'll have a unique opportunity to work closely with leadership, and tackle innovative projects that will directly impact how our business functions.

🛠 Responsibilities


Utilize AI/ML products to automate internal tools and build products that drive efficiency
Help manage the full product development lifecycle for new platform capabilities and product experiences end-to-end

✨ Our Culture

TL&DR - Pulley is a unique fit, tailored for those who align with our values and culture. We are looking for people who are excited about building a great company, not just working in a high-growth startup. In addition to function-specific skills, here are some traits that enable our team members to thrive:


First Principles Thinking. We believe in breaking down problems into their most basic parts. We don't reject ideas because they haven't worked before. We understand ""why did certain things work?"" and apply it to our situation.
Ship It & Iterate. Shipping is the starting line for learning. Ship something, talk to users, get feedback, and iterate. We focus on the inputs, on what we can control, not the outcomes. We take our best bets, and don't fixate on the finish line.
Boldly Honest & Aggressively Considerate. Being boldly honest means we push one another to act from first principles, set and hit goals, and ruthlessly prioritize. Being aggressively considerate means we care about each other as humans to win as a team. We speak up and embrace feedback.
Default Yes. We believe that something is possible unless proven otherwise. Hard problems are often solved by people who didn't know it was impossible.


We're also inspired by the culture work done at other companies and plan to develop our own playbook here too. One of the concepts that resonate most with us is the importance of stunning colleagues. If you like the sound of our environment and you're passionate about joining a team like the one we've described, we'd love to talk!

Annual Salary Range: $90,000—$125,000 USD, plus equity to be negotiated.

We believe that more startups should exist and that founder-led companies are more successful in the long term. With Pulley's cap table management tools, companies can better understand and optimize their equity for the long term. Starting a company is hard enough. Managing equity shouldn't be.

We're a high-performing team looking for passionate, execution-focused, self-starters to help us build equity management tools for founders. Pulley is growing quickly with over 3000 customers including unicorns like Clubhouse, Birdies, and Coda - all within our first year of product launch.

Our trajectory is fueled by top investors like Founders' Fund, Stripe, General Catalyst, Caffeinated Capital, 8vc, Elad Gil, among other great angels. All of our growth has been organic, and we're growing the team to meet the demand.

🌟 AI Engineer

We're looking for a curious and motivated Software Engineer who is passionate about utilizing AI to build impactful solutions. You will play a critical role in automating internal tools to improve efficiency, and developing AI-powered applications to meet the needs of internal stakeholders and customers. In this cross-functional role, you'll have a unique opportunity to work closely with leadership, and tackle innovative projects that will directly impact how our business functions.

🛠 Responsibilities


Utilize AI/ML products to automate internal tools and build products that drive efficiency

✨ Our Culture

TL&DR - Pulley is a unique fit, tailored for those who align with our values and culture. We are looking for people who are excited about building a great company, not just working in a high-growth startup. In addition to function-specific skills, here are some traits that enable our team members to thrive:


First Principles Thinking. We believe in breaking down problems into their most basic parts. We don't reject ideas because they haven't worked before. We understand ""why did certain things work?"" and apply it to our situation.
Ship It & Iterate. Shipping is the starting line for learning. Ship something, talk to users, get feedback, and iterate. We focus on the inputs, on what we can control, not the outcomes. We take our best bets, and don't fixate on the finish line.
Boldly Honest & Aggressively Considerate. Being boldly honest means we push one another to act from first principles, set and hit goals, and ruthlessly prioritize. Being aggressively considerate means we care about each other as humans to win as a team. We speak up and embrace feedback.
Default Yes. We believe that something is possible unless proven otherwise. Hard problems are often solved by people who didn't know it was impossible.


We're also inspired by the culture work done at other companies and plan to develop our own playbook here too. One of the concepts that resonate most with us is the importance of stunning colleagues. If you like the sound of our environment and you're passionate about joining a team like the one we've described, we'd love to talk!

Annual Salary Range: $90,000—$125,000 USD, plus equity to be negotiated.

Our proposition to you


We vouch to create a space where you can explore different sets of complex problems and data across industries and verticals.
To support you in your personal development, everyone at Kineo has a mentor. When you grow, so does Kineo.
Your decisions matter! You will not have a boss who decides things for you. At Kineo we believe that decisions are best made locally, by the people closest to the problem at hand.
Transparent salary and career planning from day one.
A beautiful office in the centre of Kreuzberg, with tons of benefits, such as free drinks, snacks, consoles etc.
28 days of vacation
