Soils are the unsung hero in the fight against climate change. With your help we want to uncover and use this secret. As data engineer at Seqana you will acquire and harmonize data on soils to unlock the potential of soil carbon sequestration for climate protection.

About Seqana

Seqana is an EU- and venture-backed start-up building monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) tools to drive soil carbon sequestration and the transition towards regenerative and climate-preserving agriculture.

One of the most powerful (and underutilized) solutions to climate change is capturing carbon in soils via regenerative agricultural practices. This approach has the potential for several times more climate impact than planting forests, while also providing extensive co-benefits such as erosion mitigation and improved water quality, food security, and biodiversity.

Existing solutions for MRV for the carbon market are one of the main drivers of cost and effort, and often the limiting factor for new project development. At Seqana, we combine satellite imagery, our extensive proprietary library of soil datasets, and machine learning to provide an accurate, cost-effective, and efficient MRV solution for soil organic carbon. Our product enables project developers, large corporations and NGOS with a scalable solution to measure and quantify the impact of their regenerative agricultural practices on soil carbon sequestration, enabling them to report credible CO2 reductions.

Tasks

Our growing team is looking for an ambitious and driven soil data scientist to help us quantify soil organic carbon and its sequestration by using better data. You will play a crucial part in ensuring and improving the quality of soil data we work with, and the accuracy of the statistical models derived from it.

Bonus: Experience in carbon statistical modeling or process-based models such as Century, RothC, or DNDC
Bonus: Experience with machine learning, including model training and evaluation, is a big plus


Benefits

Benefits you can expect:


Be part of our highly motivated, committed, and international team with flat hierarchies that is working on solving one of societies’ biggest challenges: Climate Change
Witness and shape the evolution of a new business being built
Collaborative DevOps culture with opportunities for continuous learning and improvement

We're making Africa the first cashless continent.

In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.

We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.

Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in.....

We're making Africa the first cashless continent.

In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.

We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast.

Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in.....

How you'll help us achieve it

Major benefits:
Subsidized health insurance for you and your dependents and retirement contributions (both vary from country to country).
6 months of fully paid parental leave and subsidized fertility assistance.
Flexible vacation, with most folks taking between 30-40 days per year.
$10,000 annual charitable donation matching.

Who We Are Looking For


You have 5+ years of proven experience in data science, data engineering or quantitative analytics

Able to communicate complex problems in a simple and relevant manner at all levels
Experience with translating analytical insights into data driven business prioritization
You have strong business acumen coupled with highly analytical mindset
You had the chance to work in a fast-paced and dynamic environment

Hybrid working approach enabling a good balance working from home and the office
One of the best Virtual Shares Incentive Programs in the market, so that everyone at Billie is invested in our success
Our “Catch a Ride with Billie” program, that enables discounted access to Berlin Public Transport (BVG)
A yearly development budget to broaden your skill set and horizons

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

Thanks for taking the time to read through one of our open roles. We’re looking for an exceptional Data Scientist to join our Research & Development team and we hope this could be a match made in heaven.




Who is Peppy?

Our mission is to fix healthcare & wellbeing. We do this by supporting the employees of our global clients, including JP Morgan, Disney, Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft, Sony, Clifford Chance, Wells Fargo, Bloomberg, and over 200 others.




Having already revolutionised the employee benefits sector with our innovative clinical products – such as the world’s first menopause benefit – we are now building the world’s most advanced benefits management platform. Think of us as a “Deel for Benefits” – a rocket-ship opportunity with a mission that truly matters. The global benefits sector encompasses employer-funded pensions, critical illness insurance, private healthcare insurance, and many other categories. This is a trillion-dollar TAM with weak, incumbent competition and almost no AI-first startups stepping up to the challenge.




We are a Series B company with $56m in funding to date, operationally cashflow positive, and with secure access to additional capital for accelerated growth. Join us for the ride of your life.

Collaborative Product Development – Collaborate with the cross-functional R&D team to integrate technological advances into the platform. Ensure that data insights contribute effectively to product strategy and innovation.




Our dream Data Scientist will have:

A graduate degree in Machine Learning, Data Science, or a closely related field, demonstrating sound theoretical knowledge and practical application skills in advanced analytics and computational modelling.
At least 2 years of industry experience in roles such as Data Science, Business Analytics, or Analytics Engineering, with a proven track record of contributing to successful projects.
Demonstrated pragmatism to problem-solving, prioritising actionable solutions over theoretical perfection. Emphasises quick decision-making and results over extensive deliberation.
Excellent communication skills capable of articulating complex data-driven insights to both technical and non-technical audiences, enhancing understanding and decision-making across the company.
Demonstrated persistence and drive across different kinds of work, with an ability to effectively manage time-sensitive tasks.
An ability to thrive in fast-paced settings characterised by ambiguity and evolving requirements, seeing this challenge as an opportunity to influence team strategy and drive focus.
Capacity to work effectively within cross-functional teams, contributing to joint projects and sharing insights that help align data science activities with broader business objectives.
Appetite for learning the latest developments in data science and machine learning, actively seeking new knowledge and techniques that can enhance their work and the value they bring to the business.

Loom Video

Our Founder/CEO, Gabe Greenberg, created a more in-depth Loom video that we highly recommend you watch! Check it out here: https://www.loom.com/share/5a8972c7fbbf46aaa3f389b2b6391c40

Overview

You’ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for the world's most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the most prominent players in the AI/LLM space today. We seek software engineers with 3+ years of experience to train large AI language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!

What Will I Be Doing?


Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""Which piece of Python code is better?"" to ""Make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterward to make it faster.""

Expectations are 15+ hours per week; however, there is no upper limit. We have engineers working 20-40 hours per week and some working 40+ hours per week. You can work as much as you want to. You'll get paid weekly per hour of work done on the platform.


Contract Length


Long term, there is no end date. They expect to have work for the next 2 years.
You can end the contract at any time. We hope you will commit to 12 months of work, but if you start and it's not a fit for you, we totally understand.


Flexible Schedules


Developers can set their own hours—ideal candidates will be interested in spending 40 hours a week. They will be with teams, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but they will also be incredibly flexible on working hours.
You can take a 3-hour lunch, no problem. Instead of tracking your hours, you are paid according to time spent on the platform, calculated in the coding exercises.


Interview Process


Apply using this Ashby form.
If you seem like a good fit, we'll send an async RLHF code review that will take 35 minutes and must be finished within 72 hours of us sending it.
You'll receive credentials to the RLHF platform. We'll then set up a group call to answer any further questions about onboarding with the company.
You'll perform a simulated production-level task (RLHF task) on the platform. This will be your final interview, which will ultimately determine your employment and leveling. Successful completion of this process provides you with an opportunity to work on projects as they become available.

Learn about state-of-the-art technologies, including single-sign on methods and integration with Identity Providers such as Okta and Azure AD
Drive large, impactful projects, delivering features rolled out and used in large organizations


About You


Experience driving projects of medium complexity autonomously and reliably, planning tasks through milestones and workstreams, coordinating multiple engineers, and delivering successfully and on time
Interested in working in a highly technical space, learn about state of the art registration and authentication technologies, and software security
Passion for software architecture and software quality
Strong commitment to building the best UX to delight consumer and enterprise users
Continuous improvement mindset and a drive to enhance the architecture, the code, and team processes
Enthusiasm for mentoring and coaching teammates and stakeholders and contributing to team growth
Relevant experience in the tech stack (React, Typescript, Scala, SQL) as well as in UX design are nice-to-haves
Relevant industry experience in authorization and software security is a big plus; if you hold this experience, make sure to emphasize it in your application


At Asana, we're committed to building teams that include a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, as this is critical to helping us achieve our mission. If you're interested in this role and don't meet every listed requirement, we still encourage you to apply.

What We’ll Offer

For this role, the estimated base salary range is between $146,000 - $178,000 CAD. The actual base salary will vary based on various factors, including market and individual qualifications objectively assessed during the interview process. The listed range above is a guideline, and the base salary range for this role may be modified.

In addition to base salary, your compensation package may include additional components such as equity, sales incentive pay (for most sales roles), and benefits.

To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical.

It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.
