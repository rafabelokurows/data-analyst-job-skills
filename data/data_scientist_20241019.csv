More on the storytelling piece - we want someone who has experience presenting technical approaches and findings to a range of technical and non-technical audiences, so we need someone with excellent written communication skills
Demonstrated professional experience working all the way from identifying data for a specific problem set, selecting appropriate solutions, and presenting the findings of those solutions. Essentially, you’ve worked from A to Z on a variety of data science projects
Someone who’s resourceful and is comfortable with decision making



What’s in it for you:

This is a full-time position that is remote. Compensation includes competitive salary, company stock grant, top (‘gold’) level of health, dental and vision insurance (KUNGFU.AI covers 100% of your premiums and 50% for any dependents), health and dependent flexible spending accounts, short- and long-term disability insurance, unlimited vacation (that you're encouraged to take), paid parental leave, and more. Please send your resume along with a cover letter explaining why you’re passionate about the idea of joining KUNGFU.AI and a great fit for this role.

These systems already impact many aspects of our lives and will continue to grow in their influence over the next two decades. Therefore, ensuring the reliability, safety, security, fairness, and understandability of these systems is critical. To date, tools to ensure that AI-powered systems meet these standards have lagged behind the tools used to develop them. This has led to two common outcomes: deployment of AI-powered systems without proper verification and validation, or conversely, failure to deploy a system after costly development time and resources due to a lack of trust in the system by stakeholders.

This is where CalypsoAI comes in. We are building a suite of products and tools to facilitate the deployment of trustworthy AI by focusing on rigorous verification and validation testing.

We are looking for a Data Scientist to join our growing team. As a key member of the Data Science team, you will work alongside other data scientists, software engineers, and product owners to research, design, and develop new features that support the development of trustworthy AI for our customers. In this role, you will be required to read and contribute to cutting-edge developments in adversarial machine learning, ML bias and fairness, model staleness, and many other fascinating areas of research. You will read the latest papers and distill their core concept into product features and product direction.

Duties And Responsibilities


Actively extend and improve our core software libraries by writing and reviewing code
Work closely with the engineering team to integrate new features into existing products
Contribute to the research, development, and technical design of new product features
Develop novel tests around the security, reliability, and robustness of ML models

Familiarity with at least one deep learning framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras)
Python programming experience (open source or product-oriented professional setting)
Practical experience with multiple supervised ML tasks
Excellent interpersonal and communication skills


Preferred Qualifications


Deep experience in at least one area leveraging tabular data (e.g. causal inference, missing data imputation, time series analysis, bayesian statistics, etc.) demonstrated via a publication, thesis (MS or PhD), or public project (code and/or write up)
Practical experience with model lifecycle: development, deployment, and monitoring
Advanced degree in a quantitative field or relevant professional experience


Why join us...


To start with: we at CalypsoAI are building the first-ever security for AI solution!
If that's not enough: We are a fast-growing startup meaning we have great opportunities to grow within the company!

About the Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has got Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Develop and automate forecasting models to plan the capacity of the support centers across different locations.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track scheduling efficiency, occupancy rates, and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building forecasting models & time series analysis (Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters or similar).
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in Cost Analysis, What-if Scenario Analysis, Capacity planning, and Workforce Management is nice to have but not mandatory.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

Scaling Open Source ML: How Wolt Uses K8s To Deliver Great Food to Millions - Kubecon Europe 2022

End-To-End ML With Flyte by Wolt - Jan 25 Flyte OSS Sync Up

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin, or Stockholm. Read more about our hybrid and remote setup here.

Our humble expectations


You have a background in software engineering and/or machine learning engineering and have experience with the ML lifecycle, from exploration and training to deployment and monitoring.
Previous experience of working with or as an Applied Scientist is also helpful in order to be able to speak the same language with the different applied science teams.
You have a user-focused mindset, considering big picture and impact of the final internal platform user, beyond the technical implementation and development
We work with Python, Snowflake, Kafka, Postgres, Ray, AWS & Kubernetes. Previous experience with those technologies is highly recommended but don’t worry, we’re not expecting you to know everything before joining!
Good communication and collaboration skills are essential to be able to work with different teams at Wolt and to collaborate with our stakeholders.
We also value taking ownership beyond the obvious, your motivation to learn new things and willingness to teach and share with your colleagues at Wolt.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Fernanda (fernanda.prado.e.silva@wolt.com).

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 700+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 60 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

About the Support Group

As the name Support Group implies, this group is responsible for the core part of the customer experience journey that has got Wolt top-notch ratings in app stores.

During the years we’ve invested a lot in the in-house built support tooling as we believe that it’s the only way we can ensure the satisfaction of all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations’ quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also want to proactively identify and solve issues even before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

About The Support Analytics Team

Our Support Analytics team’s main goal is to deliver an amazing Customer, Merchants & Courier support experience while optimizing our operations by providing actionable insights and quantifying the impact of those actions on the overall business. 💡

You’ll be part of this team working with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Your job will mainly focus on driving operational efficiency with the Workforce Management (WFM) team and optimizing resource allocation by creating accurate scheduling and intraday forecasts, simplifying forecasting processes, building and supporting KPI dashboards, conducting root cause analysis for SLA improvements, exploring cost optimization opportunities, managing the capacity plan framework, enhancing the WFM data pipeline, and uncovering data-driven insights to refine planning, scheduling, reporting, and intraday management.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Can…


Passionately leverage your analytical skill sets to tell the story about business performance and align executives around what matters and why.
Collaborate with senior stakeholders across Finance, Product, Analytics, and Support Operations, including country and regional heads of support and the overall head of Customer Service, to influence our operating model and how we structure our queues to provide the best support for our customers
Develop and automate forecasting models to plan the capacity of the support centers across different locations.
Maintain and improve efficiency metrics. You will track scheduling efficiency, occupancy rates, and other key performance indicators and advise on what we can do to improve
Create metrics and build data pipelines, transforming data into valuable information to be used in critical decision-making.
Use advanced analytics & statistical analysis to accelerate decision-making and build heuristics to quantify the impact of those decisions.
Work backward from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions.


Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
3+ years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Exceptional communications skills, with the ability to influence and advise senior stakeholders through telling exciting and valuable stories from any data exploration
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building forecasting models & time series analysis (Prophet, SARIMA, Holt-Winters or similar).
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Comfortable with building data pipelines using Airflow or similar tools.
Previous experience in Cost Analysis, What-if Scenario Analysis, Capacity planning, and Workforce Management is nice to have but not mandatory.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

Communicate technical methods and results clearly in well structured reports and presentations to a range of technical and non-technical audiences.


Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications


Advanced degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., data sciences, statistics, biomedical informatics, computer science, applied mathematics, or similar), or equivalent practical experience.
2+ years experience applying advanced machine learning and AI techniques (supervised and unsupervised methods, LLMs, NLP) to clinical data.
Direct experience working with and curating real-world data, such as EHR, including a deep understanding of the complexities of this structured and unstructured clinical data.
Strong proficiency in Python.


Preferred Qualifications


Familiarity with medical terminologies and ontologies.
Familiarity with software engineering practices and experience developing production software.
Experience working with clinical subject matter experts.
Ability to work cross-functionally on teams, with a tolerance for ambiguity.
