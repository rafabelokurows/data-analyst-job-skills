About the Consumer Group

As the name Consumer Group implies, this group is responsible for building and developing Wolt’s consumer-facing products. The core mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in a pocket.

About The Consumer Data Science Team

Consumer Analytics team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists (Analytics) and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering team who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, Design and Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience that requires a good mix of technical and stakeholder engagement skills. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics or data science role. Data Scientists at Wolt take ownership of the business outcomes.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst the chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using data science skills to solve business problems, we're looking for someone like you.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland and Sweden. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
5+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent for product development (preferably consumer-facing).
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

About the Team

The Marketing Analytics Team at Wolt focuses on solving marketing challenges and is tasked with optimising Wolt’s marketing mix through attribution, MMM, and Experimentation, enabling effective measurement of different marketing initiatives and working with the marketing team to identify areas for improvement and growth across all Wolt countries. Considering the scale of Wolt’s marketing function, there are many exciting problems to be solved and plenty of opportunities to make a business impact.

Data Scientists at Wolt work to uncover insights and turn them into relevant recommendations, driving decisions for the entire organisation. On the Marketing Analytics team we are focused on measuring the effectiveness of our marketing spend and optimising how we acquire and retain users.

Our team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics and data science skills to drive business outcomes, we're looking for someone like you.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Will…


Produce recommendations and use statistical techniques and hypothesis testing and other experimentation techniques to validate your findings
Provide insights to help business and product leaders understand marketplace dynamics, user behaviours, and long-term trends
Use quantitative analysis and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand what drives our business
Build full-cycle analytics experiments, reports, and dashboards using SQL, R, Python, or other scripting and statistical tools
Identify and measure levers to help move essential metrics and make recommendations
Possess excellent stakeholder management skills, know how to effectively collaborate well with strategy, operations, product, finance and engineering
Help our cross-functional teams use various data points to properly size the potential initiatives and opportunities
Work backwards from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions
Report against our goals by identifying essential metrics and building executive-facing dashboards to track progress
Act as mentors and guide the team towards actionable outcomes


Our humble expectations


At least 5 years of experience in data analytics, consulting, or related quantitative role
The ability to take ambiguous problems and solve them in a structured, hypothesis-driven, data-supported way
The determination to initiate and lead/own strategic projects to completion in a scrappy environment with a cross-functional team
Experience working with experimentation techniques (A/B testing, Causal Inference) and interpreting hypothesis testing
Proficiency in at least one programming language, preferably Python and/or R
Expertise with SQL queries, Basic ETL, Predictive modelling
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualisation tools (e.g. Looker, Tableau)
Clear and concise communication with strong cross-functional partnership experience
Drive measurement strategy for the area under scope, defining success metrics, and implementing best practices around experiment design and statistical analysis


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

Mode of Employment: Part-time / Fixed Term

A Snapshot of Your Day

Your working day starts flexibly around 8-9 am, either in the office or in your home office. You start the day by taking a look at our Kanban board. Here you find the tasks that need to be prioritized and choose one that matches your current focus. Depending on the task, you think about potential data science solutions for the problems in our purchasing organization. You contribute your ideas, coordinate with colleagues and help to translate the requirements into technical solutions.

You set about turning the concept into reality using Python and SQL. You will use state-of-the-art frameworks and platforms such as Streamlit, Azure OpenAI Services, Snowflake, PostgeSQL, etc. Once you have a first draft of the solution, you can deploy it to AWS yourself using Gitlab and existing CI pipelines and test it directly.

In the afternoon, you will have regular coordination meetings with your colleagues. Our team consists of Data Scientists, Data Engineers and Cloud Engineers who work closely together. We discuss the current status of the projects, exchange views on challenges and solutions and plan the next steps. Two to three times a week, we hold coordination meetings with stakeholders from the organization. Here we discuss the status of the projects, test new functions and work out the next steps together.

At the end of the day, you document your progress, update the Kanban board and make sure that all open points for the next day are clearly defined. After that, you've earned your day off!

Why join us?

Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Our mission is to help every company go beyond the books. Pleo itself means ‘more than you’d expect’, and it’s been the secret to our success over the last 8 years. So it’s only fitting that we’d pass this philosophy onto our customers to help them make the most of their finances.

We think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Finance teams shouldn’t be siloed from the rest of the organisation – they should work in unity with marketing, sales, IT and everyone else.

Speaking of working in unity, our values tell the story of how we work at Pleo. We have four core values, the first of which is ‘champion the customer’, which means we address real pain points that businesses face. Next up is ‘succeed as a team’, which highlights how our strength lies in our diversity and trust in each other. We also ‘make it happen’ by taking bold decisions and following through to deliver results. Last but not least, we ‘build to scale’, creating lasting solutions that address today’s challenges and anticipate tomorrow’s needs.

So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 850+ team, from over 100 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal and Lisbon offices —and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us, we'll help you set up the best remote setup possible and make sure you still have time to connect with your team.

Mode of Employment: Part-time / Fixed Term

A Snapshot of Your Day

Your working day starts flexibly around 8-9 am, either in the office or in your home office. You start the day by taking a look at our Kanban board. Here you find the tasks that need to be prioritized and choose one that matches your current focus. Depending on the task, you think about potential data science solutions for the problems in our purchasing organization. You contribute your ideas, coordinate with colleagues and help to translate the requirements into technical solutions.

You set about turning the concept into reality using Python and SQL. You will use state-of-the-art frameworks and platforms such as Streamlit, Azure OpenAI Services, Snowflake, PostgeSQL, etc. Once you have a first draft of the solution, you can deploy it to AWS yourself using Gitlab and existing CI pipelines and test it directly.

In the afternoon, you will have regular coordination meetings with your colleagues. Our team consists of Data Scientists, Data Engineers and Cloud Engineers who work closely together. We discuss the current status of the projects, exchange views on challenges and solutions and plan the next steps. Two to three times a week, we hold coordination meetings with stakeholders from the organization. Here we discuss the status of the projects, test new functions and work out the next steps together.

At the end of the day, you document your progress, update the Kanban board and make sure that all open points for the next day are clearly defined. After that, you've earned your day off!

Humans interacting with our product should feel valued, delighted and impactful in whatever they are trying to do. This will be a fixed term contract of 12 months.

Your Responsibilities


Collaborate closely with stakeholders, including product managers and business leaders, to understand their objectives and requirements. Lead the scoping, design, and development phases to create tailored, data-inspired solutions

Are self-sufficient, solution-driven, and love to see the impact of your work and team
Have excellent hands-on knowledge of SQL + Python/R and experience with more advanced analytics topics such as cohort and regression analysis

Why join us?

Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Our mission is to help every company go beyond the books. Pleo itself means ‘more than you’d expect’, and it’s been the secret to our success over the last 8 years. So it’s only fitting that we’d pass this philosophy onto our customers to help them make the most of their finances.

We think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Finance teams shouldn’t be siloed from the rest of the organisation – they should work in unity with marketing, sales, IT and everyone else.

Speaking of working in unity, our values tell the story of how we work at Pleo. We have four core values, the first of which is ‘champion the customer’, which means we address real pain points that businesses face. Next up is ‘succeed as a team’, which highlights how our strength lies in our diversity and trust in each other. We also ‘make it happen’ by taking bold decisions and following through to deliver results. Last but not least, we ‘build to scale’, creating lasting solutions that address today’s challenges and anticipate tomorrow’s needs.

So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 850+ team, from over 100 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal and Lisbon offices —and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us, we'll help you set up the best remote setup possible and make sure you still have time to connect with your team.

We pay it forward - we are always helpful. To customers, to partners and most importantly to each other. Not because it will ‘pay back', because it's the right thing to do.

We are adaptable - we understand in a world that is changing faster than ever before - the only constant is change. The average lifespan of a Fortune 100 company in 1958 was 61 years, now it is 18 years. We adapt to a changing world, constantly iterating, moving forward and staying relevant.

Yes first - we are on a mission to build something which has never been done before from the ground up. It will be a hard journey full of challenges which are currently unsolved. Our culture is defined by the fact that when we are confronted with challenges, we work from the assumption that it is possible to overcome them.

We are transparent - we challenge each other. Regardless of title, seniority or reporting lines. We give feedback and we are hungry to receive it. We value honest feedback delivered with kindness, and we value people who ask questions.

We always trust, respect and care for each other - it's no easy feat working in a startup, let alone one with goals as ambitious as ours. At sequel we believe no one is ever too busy to support fellow team members and that we should always be helpful, inclusive and selfless in the way we work. Diversity of background and thought is celebrated as we respect and appreciate what makes us all different. We don't tolerate free riders, egos or workplace politics.

Working with panel and first-party data in over 80 countries, we have the world’s fastest growing cross-media measurement footprint, underpinned by versatility, scale, technology and expertise, to drive long-term business growth for our clients and partners.




Job Title: Data Scientist

Location: London, Grays Inn Road

Full time/Permanent




Kantar is the leader in providing audience and advertising measurement tools and intelligence. With a track record in audience research services across 50+ countries, Kantar is at the forefront of technological developments in audience measurement in the media industry, working with broadcasters and advertisers, media agencies and industry committees. The data science team provides research and technical expertise, support, oversight, and methodological development to our global operating services and sits within the Global Product team.

These will include Kantar’s internally owned data and data from Kantar’s global partners such as global advertisers, national and international broadcasters, and global online social media and publishing platforms.




The major area of interest and development in the audience measurement space over the last few years involve the integration of multiple data sources, with a view of creating new and more complete hybrid datasets. These data sets combine TV and digital advertising platforms information and use the accuracy of panel-based data together with the breath and extension of census level information.




The goal is to have individual-level information across advertising platforms and media, providing all the usual features such as demographic reach and frequency estimates for highly granular and accurate viewing insight, without the limitations of panel sizes.

Develop prototypes of statistical and machine learning models in Python, ensuring they integrate seamlessly into existing data pipelines.
Work collaboratively with data scientists, product managers, project managers, and software engineers to align project goals and optimise product development.
Write detailed requirement documents and practical guides to facilitate the engineering team in deploying models into production environments efficiently.
Conduct thorough data investigations to ensure the quality and completeness of datasets and oversee quality control measures for modelling outcomes.
Actively engage in team knowledge-sharing sessions and deliver presentations to discuss findings, insights, and methodologies across the team and broader organisation.




Role Requirements

2 years minimum experience
Very strong mathematical and statistical skills, and with a passion for the development and implementation of new models.
Programming and data analysis experience in Python
Skilled in working with large and complex datasets with a keen eye for detail and accuracy.
Experienced in working independently.

We believe that time is the ultimate luxury and that modern engineering and design, combined with the industry's highest standards of service, can unlock an unparalleled experience for our customers. From on-demand chauffeuring, concierge service, to our best-in-class app, we exist to help our clients reclaim their time by connecting them to the places and people that matter.

More than 40% of our team works in product & engineering, and both Wheely founders are technical. We are also unapologetically design centric. It's not about A/B testing one hundred shades of blue, but crafting the perfect shade. We also take a privacy-first approach and believe that where people travel, and who they travel with, is at their discretion.

We have refused government requests to hand over journey data, and are currently developing bespoke technology to put our clients' movements beyond even our own reach.

Backed by leading global investors, Wheely is poised for the next phase of our journey. Over the next 5-10 years, we plan to offer a full portfolio of luxury services and expand into more international cities, building on our success in London, Paris, and Dubai.

It's very hard to find a company product without geo services involvement. From the mechanic heart of the system to the polished passenger application you will find to name a few: routing, map display, differential privacy for location data and map matching. While a lot of mapping tech comes from commercial third-party solutions, we implement a fair share of in-house ideas. And the more the business grows, the more the innovations are needed. This is where you have a great opportunity to mix your strong data science skills with your passion to deliver the seamless product experience to every part of our system.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$175,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.

What you’ll do

As a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.

Responsibilities


Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

From designing our data models to implementing the subtle interaction behaviors that differentiate good software from great software. We work closely with UX Designers, Product Managers, and Data Scientists throughout the entire product process, from conception to post-launch reflection.

We are looking for a Software Engineer to join the Login & Signup (LNS) team in our Vancouver Office. The LNS team is responsible for handling the registration and authentication of Asana's users, with emphasis on secure login for enterprise accounts, such as single sign-on through Identity Providers (Okta, OneLogin, Google SSO, etc.) and multi-factor authentication. It is a full-stack team; tech stack includes TypeScript/React and some Scala.

In enterprise applications, user account management and login is a challenging, multi-faceted technical space encompassing software security, compliance to industry standards and legal regulations, large-scale IT administration needs, and quality of end-user experience. LNS' goal is to create and maintain a best-in-class registration and authentication system for Asana: we want it to be compliant with the most recent security standards and regulations, safe for enterprises to adopt, fully integrated with leading identity management frameworks, while offering the most delightful, smooth and seamless user experience.

You’ll advocate for engineering best practices and work cross-functionally to define and build powerful admin features while influencing the team's velocity. You'll mentor other engineers and advocate for code and component quality, reusability, and consistency; and you'll be at the forefront of a new wave of consumer-like experiences for the enterprise and enjoy the challenge of balancing speed of execution with quality and building a product that users love.

This role is based in Vancouver, with an office-centric hybrid schedule. The standard in-office days are Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Most Asanas have the option to work from home on Wednesdays. Working from home on Fridays depends on the type of work you do and the teams with which you partner. If you're interviewing for this role, your recruiter will share more about the in-office requirements.
