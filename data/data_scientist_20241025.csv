We work with over 500 restaurants across the UK, Germany and France to prepare market leading food propositions. We also work closely with delivery platforms to optimise marketing, merchandising and pricing - ensuring our brands are well presented and our marketing spend maximises ROI.

We raised over £22MM in series A funding, and are now scaling operations to achieve profitability over the next 6 months. As we scale, we are driving a dual focus on (1) automation and (2) brand and product quality. This dual focus is key to us unlocking profitability, and making sure we deliver food that customers love.

We are passionate about delivering fantastic products to our customers, and supporting these with market leading brands.

This role will report directly into the eCommerce and Supply Chain director. It will focus on automating reports to support buying decisions, and monitor restaurant level compliance with our supply chain.

How does our supply chain work?

Broadly speaking, Peckwater places bulk ingredients orders from large wholesalers who deliver into our distributors. Our estate of restaurant partners then place orders from these distributors for the ingredients they need to make our food brands.

The Problem

We do not have an automated way of monitoring restaurant partner buying activity, and thus can't determine the level of compliance with our supply chain. Instead, we run manual processes to flag ""bad actors"" who may be buying their ingredients from other, poorer quality, sources. This is the biggest challenge to us delivering great quality food to our customers, and driving our ratings performance on delivery platforms.

The Role:


Pipeline inventory level data into quicksight to enable reporting on our stock levels
Build a reporting dashboard that indicates when new orders to our suppliers need triggering. This should set minimum re-order thresholds based on ""weeks of cover""
Pipeline purchasing data from our restaurant partners to enable a quick view on partner level supply chain compliance.
Build automated 'compliance reporting' to highlight non compliant partners for our account management team to take action on.
