Octave Bioscience is developing a suite of novel measurement tools that feed into structured analytical data models aimed at improving care management decisions to create better patient outcomes at lower costs. We are focusing our efforts on neurodegenerative disease, starting with multiple sclerosis (MS), to bring direct, positive impact to people’s lives. We are delighted to be expanding our work to Parkinson’s Disease (PD) as the next neurodegenerative disease to tackle. As a team, we constantly learn together and seek new solutions, operating in areas that are unknown. We share a common mission and build our flywheel from the diverse backgrounds of our collaborators.




About the Role

To develop our quantitative capabilities, we are seeking a data scientist to help deliver solutions across very diverse data sets. We are seeking a candidate with strong expertise in bioinformatics, data analytics, and machine learning/artificial intelligence capabilities. The data scientist will be primarily responsible for providing recommendations and delivering actionable insights in our proteomic biomarker program. The ideal candidate should have a strong statistical and machine learning background (with experience in applications to biology), as well as good collaboration, documentation and communication skills. Our mission requires constant iteration of the company’s approach to both biology and data science as well as passion to work in a regulated healthcare environment.




Responsibilities

Accountable for the development of data analytics tools, predictive models, and emergent insight capabilities that make use of complementary and complex data sets.
Use software tools to build algorithms and models, and draw actionable insights from large data sets.
Build predictive models across multiple areas of interest with a strong emphasis on biology of neurodegenerative diseases.




Technical Skills

Minimum:
Experience with analysis of large scale proteomic and/or genomic data sets
Experience with supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches, including but not limited to classification, regression, clustering, and other forms of anomaly detection/pattern recognition
Direct experience with coding in Python or R
Comfortable dealing with dimensionality reduction, cross validation, and augmentation of small datasets under uncertainty
Experience in using warehousing, data lake and big data tools (e. g., S3, Apache Spark, BigQuery, Hadoop)
Experience interpreting biological statistics and translating them to clear relationships of clinical outcomes for clinical and business stakeholders
Self-driven and intellectually curious to solve challenging problems
Collaborate with multiple teams (internally and externally)
Strong team player willing to learn new platforms and tools
Preferred:
Experience with Databricks
Experience in modeling biochemical networks, especially at the cellular and protein level
Preparation and presentation of journal manuscripts, research papers, posters, at scientific and academic conferences
Familiarity with brain neurophysiology and modeling mammalian cells like neurons
Familiarity with neurodegenerative disease pathophysiology, specifically Parkinson's
Experience in artificial neural networks (including convolutional) methodologies and technologies (Spark, TensorFlow, Keras, etc)
Experience in visualization tools (e.g., Candela, Periscope, Spark, D3, Google Chart, ggplot, Tableau)




Qualifications

Minimum:
Master of Science in Computer Science, Biology or in a related science, technology, engineering, or pure/applied math discipline
Experience and passion to work in a fast-paced agile engineering environment and start-up
Dedication and perseverance to find insights and data-driven predictive solutions
Preferred:
A background in computational and/or systems biology
Experience working in the life science industry - therapeutic development, diagnostics, companion diagnostics
PhD in Computer Science or in STEM Majors (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math)
Direct experience with compliance to ISO 13485, 62304, 27000, GDPR, HIPAA, CLIA, FDA 510K, SaaMD, 21 CFR part 11, or other industry related regulations/standards




Pay range and compensation package

The salary range for this role takes into account the wide range of factors that are considered in making compensation decisions including skill sets; experience and training; licensure and certifications; and other business and organizational needs. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. The disclosed range estimate has not been adjusted for any applicable geographic differential associated with the location at which the position may be filled. At Octave, it is not typical for an individual to be hired at or near the top of the range for their role and compensation decisions are dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case. A reasonable estimate of the current range is $150,000 to $200,000 per year. You may also be eligible to participate in a discretionary annual incentive program, subject to the rules governing the program, whereby an award, if any, depends on various factors, including, without limitation, individual and organizational performance. Please note that the compensation details listed in posting reflect the base salary only, and do not include bonus, equity, or benefits.




Equal Opportunity Statement

WE ARE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER. Applicants and employees are considered for positions and are evaluated without regard to mental or physical disability, race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, genetic information, military or veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status or any other protected Federal, State/Province or Local status unrelated to the performance of the work involved.

Design and implement highly generalizable models for predicting various outcomes. Incorporate and develop learnings back into the product for continuous improvement opportunities
Build demos, guidance documentation, and assist with training to help others become more proficient
Take responsibility for modeling implementation in real world settings. This may include creating experiments and developing prototypes, with the goal of returning practical value to our customers




We are looking for:

MS or PhD in a quantitative field (Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, etc.) with hands-on experience of 3 years or more – experience in financial services is a plus!
Strong fundamentals in programming, statistics, mathematics, and ML algorithms (neural networks, tree-based methods, optimizers, super/unsupervised learning, feature engineering, etc.)
Expert experience designing, developing, and implementing machine learning models/algorithms. Familiar with implementing and developing/extending ML/AI frameworks (TensorFlow, XGBoost, Scikit-learn, etc.)
Good development awareness regarding memory, disk I/O, and CPU/GPU management. Experience with modular/modern software design practices strongly preferred, in addition to experience with Python
Passionate about ML/AI and how it can improve on the world
