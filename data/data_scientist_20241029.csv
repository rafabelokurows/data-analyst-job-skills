About the Team

The Marketing Analytics Team at Wolt focuses on solving marketing challenges and is tasked with optimising Wolt’s marketing mix through attribution, MMM, and Experimentation, enabling effective measurement of different marketing initiatives and working with the marketing team to identify areas for improvement and growth across all Wolt countries. Considering the scale of Wolt’s marketing function, there are many exciting problems to be solved and plenty of opportunities to make a business impact.

Data Scientists at Wolt work to uncover insights and turn them into relevant recommendations, driving decisions for the entire organisation. On the Marketing Analytics team we are focused on measuring the effectiveness of our marketing spend and optimising how we acquire and retain users.

Our team comprises a cross-section of Data Scientists and Analytics Engineers. We work closely with the Data Engineering and Machine Learning teams who help ensure we have the right platform to deliver our insights at scale. We partner with Product, Engineering, and Strategy & Operations teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision making. This is a rare, operational and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics and data science skills to drive business outcomes, we're looking for someone like you.

You're Excited About This Opportunity Because You Will…


Produce recommendations and use statistical techniques and hypothesis testing and other experimentation techniques to validate your findings
Provide insights to help business and product leaders understand marketplace dynamics, user behaviours, and long-term trends
Use quantitative analysis and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand what drives our business
Build full-cycle analytics experiments, reports, and dashboards using SQL, R, Python, or other scripting and statistical tools
Identify and measure levers to help move essential metrics and make recommendations
Possess excellent stakeholder management skills, know how to effectively collaborate well with strategy, operations, product, finance and engineering
Help our cross-functional teams use various data points to properly size the potential initiatives and opportunities
Work backwards from understanding and sizing problems to ideating solutions
Report against our goals by identifying essential metrics and building executive-facing dashboards to track progress
Act as mentors and guide the team towards actionable outcomes


Our humble expectations


At least 5 years of experience in data analytics, consulting, or related quantitative role
The ability to take ambiguous problems and solve them in a structured, hypothesis-driven, data-supported way
The determination to initiate and lead/own strategic projects to completion in a scrappy environment with a cross-functional team
Experience working with experimentation techniques (A/B testing, Causal Inference) and interpreting hypothesis testing
Proficiency in at least one programming language, preferably Python and/or R
Expertise with SQL queries, Basic ETL, Predictive modelling
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualisation tools (e.g. Looker, Tableau)
Clear and concise communication with strong cross-functional partnership experience
Drive measurement strategy for the area under scope, defining success metrics, and implementing best practices around experiment design and statistical analysis


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

Interest towards LLMs and GenAI and their applications to solving problems in production.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Fernanda Prado (fernanda.prado.e.silva@wolt.com).

Helsing is a defence AI company. Our mission is to protect our democracies. We aim to achieve technological leadership, so that open societies can continue to make sovereign decisions and control their ethical standards.




As democracies, we believe we have a special responsibility to be thoughtful about the development and deployment of powerful technologies like AI. We take this responsibility seriously.




We are an ambitious and committed team of engineers, AI specialists and customer-facing programme managers. We are looking for mission-driven people to join our European teams – and apply their skills to solve the most complex and impactful problems. We embrace an open and transparent culture that welcomes healthy debates on the use of technology in defence, its benefits, and its ethical implications.




The role




At Helsing we deliver AI-based capabilities and the enabling foundation that allow machines to perceive and assist human decision-making. You will have the unique opportunity to shape AI capabilities in one of the most challenging sectors, where high generalisation capabilities need to be paired with hardware constraints and robustness against adversarial attacks.




You will be part of a team focused on reinforcement learning, where you will design, train and deploy agents in complex multi-agent environments.




The day-to-day




You will contribute to our reinforcement learning stack by implementing, improving and extending the current state of the art in multi-agent reinforcement learning.




You will contribute to projects and will collaborate with people across several teams and backgrounds.




You should apply if you




Hold MSc in machine learning with a speciality in either reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, automation and control, or robotics.
Have excellent communication skills and the ability to report and present research findings clearly and efficiently both internally and externally
Are passionate about keeping up to date with current research and enjoy reimplementing / extending papers on state of the art Deep Learning-based approaches
Possess solid software engineering skills, writing clean and well-structured code in Python and/or languages like Rust, Java, or modern C++, and experience deploying AI software to production including testing, QA, and monitoring




Note: We operate at an intersection where women, as well as other minority groups, are systemically under-represented. We encourage you to apply even if you don’t meet all the listed qualifications; ability and impact cannot be summarised in a few bullet points.




Nice to have




PhD in reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, automation and control, robotics, or related fields and have authored publications in top-tier journals and conferences (eg, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAMAS).
Experience with large-scale RL training.
Experience modelling and training multi-agent controllers using state-of-the-art tools and techniques.
Experience deploying AI software to production including testing, quality assurance, and monitoring




Join Helsing and work with world-leading experts in their fields




Helsing’s work is important. You’ll be directly contributing to the protection of democratic countries while balancing both ethical and geopolitical concerns.
The work is unique. We operate in a domain that has highly unusual technical requirements and constraints, and where robustness, safety, and ethical considerations are vital. You will face unique Engineering and AI challenges that make a meaningful impact in the world.
Our work frequently takes us right up to the state of the art in technical innovation, be it reinforcement learning, distributed systems, generative AI, or deployment infrastructure. The defence industry is entering the most exciting phase of the technological development curve. Advances in our field of world are not incremental: Helsing is part of, and often leading, historic leaps forward.
In our domain, success is a matter of order-of-magnitude improvements and novel capabilities. This means we take bets, aim high, and focus on big opportunities. Despite being a relatively young company, Helsing has already been selected for multiple significant government contracts.
We actively encourage healthy, proactive, and diverse debate internally about what we do and how we choose to do it. Teams and individual engineers are trusted (and encouraged) to practise responsible autonomy and critical thinking, and to focus on outcomes, not conformity. At Helsing you will have a say in how we (and you!) work, the opportunity to engage on what does and doesn’t work, and to take ownership of aspects of our culture that you care deeply about.




What we offer




A focus on outcomes, not time-tracking
Competitive compensation and stock options
Relocation support
