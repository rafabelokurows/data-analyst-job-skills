About Us

Our mission is to help companies and individuals solve data analytics problems by covering the full spectrum of the data journey (from ingestion, transformation and finally distribution of data to downstream applications) with a Modern Data Stack. Most companies are lacking internal knowledge to leverage the limitless power of emerging Modern Data Stack tools and our goal is to educate them and implement powerful solutions with those technologies.

We achieve this by creating a new type of consulting company:


Embracing a culture that prioritizes creativity and strategic thinking
Incorporating education as one of our key output in each project we deliver
Ensuring the growth and well-being of our employees


Regarding our technology stack, we are a Google Cloud partner and host most of our solutions on Google Cloud. On the data side, we are relying on a Modern Data Stack and are savvy users of dbt, Airflow and Airbyte. We are always on the lookout for the best technologies and adapt ourselves quickly to market trends.

There has never been a better time to join our Kingdom than today!

Role Overview:

As a Data Scientist, you will be joining the AI team in a Product Engineering organisation that is 100% dedicated to delivering first-class experiences to our players through our sports and gaming products. You will have a great understanding of modern data science techniques (including Generative AI) and the practices that underpin successful outcomes. You will work hand-in-hand with the AI, data and product teams to design, build, deliver machine learning solutions.

What You Will Be Doing:

Build it: Take a leading role in developing advanced analytics and machine learning models, with a focus on:
Recommender Systems
NLP & Large (& Small) Language Models
Forecasting & Time Series
Unsupervised learning
Operate it: Drive automation of data processing, model training, and deployment processes using MLOps practices Develop insights:
Extract and interpret complex data to inform business decisions and strategy
Collaborate: Engage with cross-functional teams to lead and contribute to company-wide data-driven initiatives

What You Need for This Role:


Proven track record in applying data science techniques to real-world problems and delivering business impact
5+ years experience in relevant professional experience in data science
Experience with a wide range of data science techniques and tools
Expert proficiency in Python
Experience with big data technologies and platforms: Databricks & PySpark
Expertise in machine learning algorithms and their practical applications - this is 100% applied AI
Experience with cloud-based data platforms (e.g., Azure ML, AWS SageMaker) & deep learning frameworks (PyTorch)

Ownership & Accountability: We think like owners. If we see a problem, we find a solution. We are pragmatic and always strive to do more with less.
Speed & Focus: We plan, we strategize, but mostly, we DO. Without doing, there is no progress, we can always change direction but only if we start moving. Fast beats slow.
Low Ego: The best solutions are achieved when we leave our egos at the door. We always seek opportunities to learn in every situation. No job too small.
Fun: On balance, we believe in having fun whilst working. We maintain perspective as best as we can, and together, we celebrate our successes.

Halo is a silently controlled language generation product that seamlessly integrates generative AI with interfaces such as electromyography (EMG) signals and eye tracking. Halo facilitates communication through an AI Persona, which consists of a textual representation of personalized, distinctive, and individualized data, tailored specifically to each user and context. By dynamically retrieving and generating information from the AI Persona in real-time, we can effectively shape the model’s output through prompt engineering, ensuring the delivery of personalized and contextually appropriate responses for any given situation. Other techniques for developing a personalized large language model for each user are also considered.

This product is part of the next generation of products under the Center for Responsible AI. We aim to revolutionize how people communicate, particularly those who face communication difficulties. Join us in our mission to connect these individuals with their loved ones.
