We are a small team of young and international professionals who want to change how supply chains are run, from the ground up. We come from top companies and research centres (MIT, McKinsey, NASA, London Business School, Leonardo, Politecnico di Milano, Sant’Anna), we are backed by leading institutions from the Silicon Valley (Berkeley SkyDeck) and Italy (s2capital, B4i) and driven by a strong will to make things happen.

We are looking for individuals to join us in building the supply chain tech of the future.

🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🇮🇹 🇨🇭




Responsibilities

Our new team member will work directly with our Chief Analytics Officer, and in collaboration with the rest of the engineering team, to design, create and deploy Optimization and Machine Learning algorithms.




Examples of activities you will perform: 

Create geo-spatial forecasting models to predict demand for last-mile deliveries
Optimize large scale combinatorial problems using Operations Research algorithms (metaheuristics, genetic algorithms or exact methods)
Build datapipeline to extract insights from vast amounts of GPS datapoints
Develop custom clustering algorithms to speed up optimization model
Collaborate closely with the Software Engineering team to deploy all model in production within a real Web Application




What we offer:

A driver’s seat in a small, selected and very ambitious team. At Cargoful, every single individual matters and is crucial in transforming our vision into reality. WhatsApp only had 50 employees when sold to Facebook for $16 billion in 2014. What can we achieve in the era of one-person-billion-dollar companies? Let’s find out together.
Direct exposure to complex problems with no easy solutions. Building groundbreaking technology isn't smooth - we confront an endless stream of technical and managerial challenges that will test you rigorously and drive you to learn and improve. We all aspire to be the best professionals we can be, and to achieve this, we push ourselves hard.
Ownership, responsibility, impact. Cargoful is already powering the supply chains of large multinational corporations - there's significant room for accountability and little margin for error. Each of us takes ownership, cares for the rest of the team, and stands up when needed




What we don't offer

Regularity & smooth sailing. Every day is completely different from the previous one. The span of activities is extremely wide but we expect you to become a “little” expert in a variety of different fields. Your team-mates and clients will rely on you – that means you’ll need to be there when they need you.
The safe heaven of standards and procedures. We are building a brand new company and pre-cooked processes do not exists for us. We expect you to contribute to design how the company processes should look like in 2-5 years from now rather than adapting to rules.




Qualifications

Experience: 1-2 years
Education: Engineering, Math, Data science, Statistics or Physics degree
Language: At least B2 level (Intermediate) in English
Set-up: hybrid, 3 days/week in presence in our Milan office (Porta Romana)

There will be a focus on MLOps and the ability to scale modern NLP applications both in amount of users and data. But you don't do this in a vacuum. Rather, you're part of a multidisciplinary team where every member is equally responsible for the product's success
You keep up with the latest Data, Machine Learning & Generative AI advances, with a particular focus on what might be applicable in our context. In particular, your enthusiasm for ""what is possible"" motivates you and we expect you to transfer that enthusiasm to your team members and even our clients
You actively participate in knowledge sharing both towards peers (lessons learned, new advances, process improvements,..) as well as other people in our organisation (e.g. sales, marketing, product, strategy...). And it doesn't have to stop there: we happily support any initiatives to share our findings with the world, through blogs, talks, podcasts or guest lectures
You clearly communicate and set expectations. What realistic results can be expected? What are the greatest risks/unknowns? Always be open and honest, and don't be afraid to ask for help







Who you are:

You hold a bachelor/master/PhD degree in Computer Science (or related), and a master in Data Science / AI / Statistics or Machine Learning - or you have a proven track record in a similar role
You have a profound knowledge of Python and at least one of the most important machine learning frameworks (Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch,...) and are able to work AI platforms like Huggingface, replicate and/or AI cloud services like Vertex AI Studio, AWS Sagemaker or Azure AI Studio
You have relevant experience in going beyond running local ML experiments, but bringing ML to production, including MLOps, Data versioning, & LLM Orchestration frameworks
You have a broad awareness of the possibilities and limitations of ML, and see how Data and ML can help us build even better products for our clients.
You have an affinity with product design and engineering top-notch digital products
You highly value the principles of clean code, continuous improvement and rapid prototyping. Experience with continuous delivery and/or devops practices is a plus
Any experience with the broader services from Google Cloud Platform, AWS or Azure is a plus
You excel in sharing your knowledge with others, you enjoy coaching team members and helping them to gain more insights in your field of expertise
