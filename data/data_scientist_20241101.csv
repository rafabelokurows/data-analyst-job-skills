We are Bïrch. Our product helps marketing teams launch, manage, and analyze ads and social campaigns through automation and creative solutions. Recently, we rebranded from Revealbot to Bïrch, and we wrote about this transformation journey here. In short, we want the brand to reflect our personalities more: creative, inspiring, controversial, and diverse.

Why are we opening this hiring? To be frank, there are two reasons. The first is that we're looking to bring Machine Learning expertise to our team, aiming to leverage user data and build more automation into our product. Another reason is a happy one — our current Data Analyst is preparing to go on parental leave, and we will need backup with some analytics during this exciting time 👶

🌍 Who are we?

The answer to this question is always evolving. But for now, the answer is that we're a remote-first team of friends from around the world, with an HQ in Barcelona. And when we say friends, we mean it—Birch's founders are three school friends, so trust, playfulness, and personal touch are at our core. We hire globally and love meeting up in person: last October, we were in Barcelona, and the year before, we were in Istanbul. Our team's Instagram gives you a peek into our unique mix of cultures and backgrounds.

✍🏼 What will you do?

As part of the Product Team, you'll report directly to our CEO, Mike, and collaborate closely with the ML Squad, Product Managers, and Customer Success team. Your work will dive into Machine Learning, analytics, and statistics, and as we grow, so will your impact. Here's a taste of what your potential tasks might involve:


Explore customer data, seasonal trends, and patterns to develop recommendation models, suggest target audiences, and deliver valuable insights for our customers
Dig into creative analysis, using data to forecast performance—think ML decomposition and computer vision to understand key elements of an image
Set up A/B tests, conduct experiments, analyze results, and evaluate new feature launches
Jump into ad hoc analyses — say, investigating why conversions might be dipping
Craft clear, actionable dashboards with tools like Tableau and Mixpanel to guide team decisions

Über uns

Bereit, die Welt ein Stück weit besser zu machen? Willkommen bei envite consulting.

In unserem Home-turf der Softwareentwicklung verspüren wir eine ausgeprägte Leidenschaft für Nachhaltigkeit. Sie schweißt uns zusammen und liefert die Basis für ein starkes Miteinander. Unseren Veränderungswillen rund um Green IT kombinieren wir mit einem modernen unternehmerischen Mindset. Consulting-Knowhow und Umsetzungskompetenz gehen bei envite stets Hand in Hand.

Unser Umfeld – genau richtig für Dich!

envite bietet mehr: anspruchsvolle Beratungsprojekte, viel Verantwortung. Aber auch eine revolutionäre Organisationsform und jeder Menge Freiheiten. Um das zu tun, was einem beruflich am wichtigsten ist.

Pioniere der Arbeitswelt.

Teil des envite-Teams zu sein, geht weit über einen klassischen Job hinaus. Wir kennen keine Hierarchieebenen, treffen Business-relevante Entscheidungen gemeinsam und mit radikaler Transparenz. Und wir verzichten bewusst auf strenge Vorschriften, Befehls- und Kontrollstrukturen. Ergebnis ist ein außergewöhnlich gutes Betriebsklima mit großen individuellen Freiräumen. Wir haben Spaß bei der Arbeit – und das spürt jeder, die mit envite zu tun hat.

Ein Arbeitsumfeld, das motiviert.

Alle in unseren Beraterteams haben Aufgaben, die fachlich optimal zu ihr und zu ihm passen, die motivieren und einen wichtigen Beitrag für eine lebenswerte Welt leisten. Unsere Projekte decken viele unterschiedliche Aspekte der Green IT ab. Der Blick fürs Ganze ist dabei genauso wichtig wie die Liebe zum Detail. Wir arbeiten vor Ort bei Kunden, in modernen Co-Working-Spaces und im Homeoffice. Und wir

nutzen konsequent alle Vorteile einer digital gut vernetzten New-Work-Ausstattung. Sie macht uns flexibel, agil, örtlich und zeitlich unabhängig.

Das hast du dir verdient.

Wer bei envite consulting arbeitet, ist kein Gehaltsempfänger im herkömmlichen Sinn. Sie und er agieren als Unternehmer:innen und partizipieren am ökonomischen Erfolg der jeweiligen Practice. Sie kann erzielte Überschüsse eigenverantwortlich einsetzen und ausschütten. Klassische Gehaltsverhandlungen braucht es nicht. Steigen beispielsweise durch ständige fachliche Qualifikation die Beratersätze, die zur Verrechnung kommen, zahlt sich das doppelt positiv aus – auf das persönliche Vorankommen wie auf die Bezüge.

This is your chance to influence how we work with data science on these new initiatives.

Our products go beyond single use. We are on a mission to make digital devices for our products that support people with intimate health care needs even better.

“You’ll get to develop custom data models and algorithms for projects and use predictive modelling to impact our end-customer experience and give them a better life. It’s a purpose that’s important to all of us here,” says Data Scientist, Anna Puggaard.

Join the R&D organisation

At our HQ in Humlebæk, you will join our Innovation Unit, where we set the direction for the product development across the organization. More specifically, you will join our Embedded Solutions team of 8 colleagues. Embedded solutions is a new focus area within Coloplast aiming to incorporate digital devices into our products.

Be part of defining the product

You will work on various projects in Embedded Solutions, exploring how we can collect and analyse data from our products and develop the needed algorithms in collaboration with our development partners.

Furthermore, you will gather data and analyse it for products under development and generate insights that help define the final product, e.g., an intelligent stoma bag, giving an alert on the user’s phone.

Specifically, you will interpret the data and make it presentable to project teams and various management levels, as well as


Work with stakeholders (marketing, R&D, IT, scientific affairs) to identify opportunities for leveraging data to business opportunities and solutions
Develop custom models and algorithms for projects and use predictive modelling
Develop processes and tools to monitor and analyse model performance and data accuracy
Mine and analyse data to drive optimisation and improvement of product development, marketing, and customer support
Explore new technologies and models to solve problems

In this role, being able to collaborate with many stakeholders across the organisation, share your knowledge, and find use cases is crucial.

You can work in technical detail without losing your overview and ensure that we all understand what data tells us by communicating it in a clear and concise manner to stakeholders outside your field.

Finally, we imagine that you


Hold a degree within statistics, mathematics, computer science, or similar
May have graduated recently or have some experience working with data sets and building statistical models, perhaps within pharma or medical
Have experience with Python and libraries for machine learning or similar
Have experience with tools used to manipulate data and draw insights from large data sets
Are fluent in English




Interested?

If you would like to know more about the position, please call Head of Embedded Solutions, Henrik Pedersen on +45 4911 2011. We will take candidates into the recruitment process continuously, so do not hesitate to apply. This position will remain open until a suitable candidate has been found.

Pursuing an ambitious growth agenda, Coloplast develops and markets products and services that make life easier for people with intimate healthcare needs. Employing about 16.000 people and with products available in more than 143 countries, we are one of the world´s leading medical device companies. We are constantly growing our business and always looking for new ways to move forward – we explore, learn and look for new ways of doing things.

Coloplast is committed to being an inclusive organization, where people bring their differences to work each day, fulfil their potential and have a strong sense of belonging because – and not despite – of their differences. We therefore encourage all qualified candidates to apply regardless of gender, age, race, nationality, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious belief or physical ability.

What you bring to the team:

Confirmed experience with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP and expertise in handling cloud-native applications.
Hands-on experience with containerization and orchestration tools such as Docker and Kubernetes.
Strong understanding of platform engineering, including building reusable infrastructure components, designing internal developer platforms, and automating provisioning and deployments.
Proficiency in scripting languages such as Python, Bash, or PowerShell, and experience with configuration management tools like Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation.
Experience in implementing CI/CD pipelines and working with automation tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or Azure Pipelines.
Familiarity with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles and tools for automating and maintaining infrastructure.
Solid understanding of monitoring, logging, and alerting using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, or similar.

Develop prototypes of statistical and machine learning models in Python, ensuring they integrate seamlessly into existing data pipelines.
Work collaboratively with data scientists, product managers, project managers, and software engineers to align project goals and optimise product development.
Write detailed requirement documents and practical guides to facilitate the engineering team in deploying models into production environments efficiently.
Conduct thorough data investigations to ensure the quality and completeness of datasets and oversee quality control measures for modelling outcomes.
Actively engage in team knowledge-sharing sessions and deliver presentations to discuss findings, insights, and methodologies across the team and broader organisation.




Role Requirements

2 years minimum experience
Very strong mathematical and statistical skills, and with a passion for the development and implementation of new models.
Programming and data analysis experience in Python
Skilled in working with large and complex datasets with a keen eye for detail and accuracy.
Experienced in working independently.
An ability to demonstrate analysing data and looking for stories, patterns, trends, and insights.
A PhD/master’s degree in a quantitative, mathematical, or scientific subject area.
Alternatively, equivalent experience in a commercial and data science setting
At Kantar we have an integrated way of rewarding our people based around a simple, clear, and consistent set of principles. Our approach helps to ensure we are market competitive and to support a pay for performance culture, where your reward and career progression opportunities are linked to what you deliver.




We go beyond the obvious, using intelligence, passion, and creativity to inspire new thinking and shape the world we live in. Apply for a career that’s out of the ordinary and join us.




We want to create an equality of opportunity in a fair and supportive working environment where people feel included, accepted, and are allowed to flourish in a space where their mental health and wellbeing is taken into consideration. We want to create a more diverse community to expand our talent pool, be locally representative, drive diversity of thinking and better commercial outcomes.

Location:

Abingdon, Oxfordshire

Description & Scope

Numerical simulation remains the only reliable method to solve partial differential equations to predict future states of a complex physical system - be it weather, fluid flow, quantum dynamics or orbital mechanics. SLB’s state-of-the-art reservoir simulator is used to model such a fluid flow in porous media for various applications, including Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and geothermal energy systems. The drawback of traditional numerical methods, however, is that they are computational very intensive and are not practical for many realistic workflows.

In this project, you will work on developing a physics-informed machine learning model to predict how a reservoir system behaves when CO2 is injected into it. Machine Learning models have provably been shown to run orders of magnitude faster than conventional simulators and, once trained, provide a promising alternative or enhancement to traditional solvers. The ultimate goal is to use the developed machine learning model to find optimal locations and volumes of CO2 to inject into a subsurface in order to maximize carbon storage and accelerate the global push towards Net-zero.

Deliverables

As part of the Numerical Simulation team, you will work on developing a physics-informed machine learning model to solve Partial Differential Equations on general grids and geometries. You will have access to high-fidelity 3D simulator data to develop and train novel Neural Operator and Graph Neural Network architectures. You will also be integrating this model into full workflows to show that ML solutions run orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods and will have the opportunity to publish in top-tier ML and Applied Mathematics conferences/journals (ICML, NeurIPs, ICLR etc.)

Required Skills & Qualifications


Studying for a Masters or PhD in Machine Learning, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Computer Science or a related discipline
Theoretical and practical knowledge in machine learning and deep learning
Strong programming skills and experience with one of Scikit/PyTorch/Tensorflow etc.
Ability to quickly understand and implement models from research papers


Experience in one of the following would be advantageous


Neural Operators, DeepONets or Graph Neural Networks etc
Knowledge of mass conservation equations and material balance
Simulation basics (numerical methods for solving PDE systems)


We are open to flexible, hybrid working with a combination of on-site & home working days.

SLB is an equal employment opportunity employer. Qualified applicants are considered without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, or other characteristics protected by law.

Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity and encourages creative solutions to problems. All new engineers deploy working code their first week, and we strive to broaden individual impact with support from managers, mentors, and teams. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment.

Yelp’s mission of connecting people with great local businesses requires the use of cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to scale across a vast and diverse base of users and businesses spanning various geographical locations. As an ML engineer, you will have the opportunity to foster these connections across millions of users and business listings using cutting-edge industry tools such as neural networks (NNs), large language models (LLMs), and traditional ML methods like XGBoost or linear models. You’ll be responsible for turning raw data into valuable signals and building the ML system end-to-end. This includes the full ML lifecycle from training models to deploying them in production, as well as contributing to the ML platforms these models rely on or MLOps.

This opportunity requires you to be located in the United Kingdom. We’d love to have you apply, even if you don’t feel you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Yelp, we’re looking for great people, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.

Work in the content and contributor intelligence team on text and visual understanding, along with fine tuning transformer models to derive embeddings for multiple input types
Productionize and automate model pipelines within Python services.
Drive and advocate adoption of best practices in MLOps (Machine Learning Operations).


What It Takes To Succeed


Experience developing and productionizing machine learning models, including their supported data pipeline.
Experience with machine learning using packages such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Spark MLlib, XGBoost, Sklearn, etc.
Strong coding skills in Python or equivalent (Python, Java and C++).
Solid understanding of engineering and infrastructure best practices.
The curiosity to uncover promising solutions to new problems, and the persistence to carry your ideas through to an end goal.


What You'll Get


Full responsibility for projects from day one, a collaborative team, and a dynamic work environment.
Competitive salary, a pension scheme, and an optional employee stock purchase plan.
25 days paid holiday (rising to 29 with service), plus one floating holiday.
£150 monthly reimbursement to help cover remote working expenses.
