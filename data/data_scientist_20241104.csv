We are highly nimble, with a focus on velocity between conceptualization and initial output, and laser-focused on business impact.

What You’ll Do

As a Machine Learning Engineer, you will work on the development and implementation of the cutting edge machine learning and forecasting algorithms, collaborating with business, engineering, and analytics teams. You will be tasked to build scalable, reliable and highly performant forecasting algorithms to forecast company top-line metrics in a granular way, and empower human-in-the-loop for model iteration and reinforcement learning. Your daily responsibilities will encompass a broad spectrum of tasks such as business problem quantification, model development and evaluations.

Your background

On the first day, we'll expect you to have

Experience building and scaling forecasting and machine learning models in business applications using large amounts of data
Agile development mindset, appreciating the benefit of constant iteration and improvement
Ability to communicate and explain data science concepts to diverse audiences, craft a compelling story



It's Great, But Not Required, If You Have


Experience working in a consumer or B2C space for a SaaS product provider, or the enterprise/B2B space
Experience in writing production-quality code with clean, and using CICD pipelines to automate delivery process
Excelling in solving ambiguous and complex problems, being able to navigate through uncertain situations, breaking down complex challenges into manageable components and developing innovative solutions
