Make Wayve the experience that defines your career!

Where you will have an impact

We are seeking an experienced researcher to be a founding member of our Vancouver team! We are prioritising someone with experience actively participating in AI projects applied to autonomous driving or similar robotics or decision-making domains, inclusive, but not limited to the following specific areas:


Foundation models for robotics or embodied AI
Model-free and model-based reinforcement learning
Offline reinforcement learning
Large language models
Planning with learned models, model predictive control and tree search
Imitation learning, inverse reinforcement learning and causal inference
Learned agent models: behavioural and physical models of cars, people, and other dynamic agents


Challenges you will own

You'll be working on some of the world's hardest problems, and able to attack them in new ways. You'll be a key member of our diverse, cross-disciplinary team, helping teach our robots how to drive safely and comfortably in complex real-world environments. This encompasses many aspects of research across perception, prediction, planning, and control, including:


How to leverage our large, rich, and diverse sources of real-world driving data
How to architect our models to best employ the latest advances in foundation models, transformers, world models, etc, evaluating and incorporating state-of-the-art techniques into our workflows.
Which learning algorithms to use (e.g. reinforcement learning, behavioural cloning)
How to leverage simulation for controlled experimental insight, training data augmentation, and re-simulation
How to scale models efficiently across data, model size, and compute, while maintaining efficient deployment on the car
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate research findings into scalable, production-level solutions.
You also have the potential to contribute to academic publications for top-tier conferences like NeurIPS, CVPR, ICRA, ICLR, CoRL etc. working in a world-class team, contributing to the scientific community and establishing Wayve as a leader in the field.


What you will bring to Wayve

Essential


Proven track record of research in one or more of the topics above demonstrated through deployed applications or publications.
Strong programming skills in Python, with experience in deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, numpy, pandas, etc.
Experience bringing a machine learning research concept through the full ML development cycle
Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to work independently as well as in a team environment.
Demonstrated ability to work collaboratively in a fast-paced, innovative, interdisciplinary team environment.


Desirable:


Experience bringing an ML research concept through to production and at scale
PhD in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related field


What we offer you


The chance to be part of a truly mission driven organisation and an opportunity to shape the future of autonomous driving. Unlike our competitors, Wayve is still relatively small and nimble, giving you the chance to make a huge impact
Competitive compensation and benefits
A dynamic and fast-paced work environment in which you will grow every day - learning on the job, from the brightest minds in our space, and with support for more formal learning opportunities too
A culture that is ego-free, respectful and welcoming
A hybrid working policy that combines time together in our offices and workshops to fuel innovation, culture, relationships and learning, and time spent working from home. We also operate core working hours so you can be where you need to be for family and loved ones too. Teams determine the routines that work best for them


This is a full-time role based in our office in Vancouver. At Wayve we want the best of all worlds so we operate a hybrid working policy that combines time together in our offices and workshops to fuel innovation, culture, relationships and learning, and time spent working from home.

We understand that everyone has a unique set of skills and experiences and that not everyone will meet all of the requirements listed above. If you’re passionate about self-driving cars and think you have what it takes to make a positive impact on the world, we encourage you to apply.
