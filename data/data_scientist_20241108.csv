Skilled in extracting signals from texts using embeddings to enhance prediction model
Proficient in entity-extraction from text, e.g. using modern Transformer-based Large-Language Models
Solid understanding of machine learning techniques and their practical applications
Aptitude for programming in a numerical scripting language (we primarily use Python)
A meticulous and detail-oriented mind




Nice to have

Experience using RAGs (Retrieval-Augmentation-Generation)
Working with financial/trading data
Experience with C#, C/C++ or Java
Familiarity with software engineering (version control, unit testing, object oriented-design)
Degree in Computer Science / Engineering




What we can offer you

Flat hierarchy and high levels of trust and autonomy
Exciting problems to solve
Collaborative team made up of really smart and curious people
Nice office in central Copenhagen with a hybrid work model
Pension, Health Insurance and 30 days of vacation

Dine opgaver vil blandt andet være databehandling, strategisk analyse, datakvalitetskontrol og digitaliserings projekter. Vi arbejder primært i R som vores foretrukne værktøj, men vi er også fleksible og tilpasser vores tech stack alt efter opgavens behov. Som ny kollega vil du derfor også have mulighed for at præge vores værkstøjskasse i den retning, du finder mest relevant.

Du Vil Blandt Andet Få Ansvar For At


Omsætte organisationens behov for styring og controlling til konkrete løsninger via analyser og datamodellering
Håndtere datasæt fra politikredsens fagsystemer og gennemføre solide analyser af fx produktion og ressourceforbrug
Udvikle vores datamodeller til brug for statistisk analyse af bl.a. kredsens operative områder
Implementere og vedligeholde teamets løsninger i Rstudio
Formidle komplicerede analyseresultater så budskabet står knivskarpt, herunder udarbejde gode beslutningsoplæg
Implementering af digitale løsninger i kredsen, herunder machine learning-løsninger til eksempelvis prognoser og tekstgenerering


Om dig

Du har et analytisk mindset og flair for avanceret dataanalyse og kan samtidig proaktivt omsætte indsigten herfra til viden og konkrete løsningsmuligheder. Du bliver motiveret af at bidrage til professionel styring af en vigtig samfundsinstitution, der i sidste ende skaber et tryggere samfund med mindre kriminalitet.

Din Profil Er Kendetegnet Ved


Du har praktisk erfaring med databehandling, dataanalyse og databaser, gerne med minimum 2-4 års erfaring
Du går struktureret til problemløsning og analysedesign

Activities

Join our affiliate TotalEnergies EP Denmark AS in Esbjerg !

You will join the Digital Transformation and Innovation team at TotalEnergies Denmark, based in Esbjerg. The team's primary mission is to identify opportunities for developing digital solutions through advanced data exploration, prototyping, and, depending on the projects, the development of MVPs or transfer to the Total Digital Factory. The team covers a wide range of domains, including production optimization, carbon footprint reduction, safety, and environmental and industrial performance. The activities span offshore operations, maintenance logistics, interventions on wells and installations, mobilizing hundreds of people in one of the most complex offshore oil plants in the North Sea. The stated goal is to develop and deploy ambitious solutions (prescriptive rather than descriptive) from data exploration to the development of apps and solutions in collaboration with users. For the specific position in question, the initial focus will be on understanding the causes and minimizing production losses, particularly related to valve failures, using real-time time series data. Several ongoing use cases within the team in the field of operational performance leverage GenAI components (including Azure OpenAI) and NLP. These efforts aim to enrich datasets and will likely lead to new developments. In addition to maintaining some of the use cases in production, this role provides an opportunity to delve into extremely varied topics and explore equally diverse techniques

As a data scientist in the industrial domain, the main tasks will be as follows :


Advanced feature engineering and modeling for optimization studies (identifying points of industrial performance and costs) ;
Exploratory analysis and development of use cases in collaboration with subject matter experts ;
Analysis studies based on the developed models or enriched data ;
Whenever applicable, implementation of proof-of-concept applications on themes with high potential. The development/data engineering team usually intervenes at this stage, but it is common for comprehensive profiles to enhance their own experience by taking a significant part or even leadership in this area
Technology stacks: Primarily Python with Dash/Plotly or a combination of Python and React JS, in an Azure and/or server environment. You will have to build upon the proofs of concept already initiated on these themes by the VIE (Volunteer for International Experience) whom you will replace, before developing or participating in the creation of new proofs of concept.

We are looking for an NLP Researcher that will help us greatly improve the text-processing behind our models.




At Alipes Capital, we have been the market leader in automating the financial markets since we started back in 2008, shaping a fully automatic natural language processing system for reading and interpreting financial news.




Your work

Your work will support turning massive data sets of unstructured financial information into structured datasets and mathematical models that accurately predict movements in the equity markets. In doing so, you will:

Redesign and introduce new text-processing techniques to extract additional and more accurate entities from the text-sources that underlie our trading algorithms
Maintain and curate new and existing text data sources for our analyses
Automate monitoring and benchmarking of the trading strategies




You will enjoy a wide degree of autonomy and responsibility to optimize our machine-learning pipelines, from data-ingestion to live-model performance. There is no red tape, no sales people to consult and there is ample room for creativity.




The team

All of this will happen in an informal atmosphere where technical discussions are valued and you are encouraged to take ownership of, and pride in, your work. You will impact the direction of the team, prioritize your work and choose the tools that get the job done. We are a tight-knit modeling team with fourteen passionate quantitative researchers covering six nationalities – eleven PhD’s and three MSc’s- with expertise in statistical analysis, mathematical modeling and machine learning (seven of us working directly on the text-based equity models).




We enjoy collaboration, lending a helping hand and discussing the business cases built upon our data-sets. You will be working alongside a team of software developers and a team of traders who implement and conceive the trading models with us. All team members write code and are not afraid to discuss technical details.




Need to have

Skilled in extracting signals from texts using embeddings to enhance prediction model
Proficient in entity-extraction from text, e.g. using modern Transformer-based Large-Language Models
Solid understanding of machine learning techniques and their practical applications
Aptitude for programming in a numerical scripting language (we primarily use Python)
A meticulous and detail-oriented mind




Nice to have

Experience using RAGs (Retrieval-Augmentation-Generation)
Working with financial/trading data
Experience with C#, C/C++ or Java
Familiarity with software engineering (version control, unit testing, object oriented-design)
Degree in Computer Science / Engineering




What we can offer you

Flat hierarchy and high levels of trust and autonomy
Exciting problems to solve
Collaborative team made up of really smart and curious people
Nice office in central Copenhagen with a hybrid work model
Pension, Health Insurance and 30 days of vacation




Practicalities

To apply, please send us your CV and a cover letter telling us why you think this role is a great fit for you. If your profile looks like a good match, we will get in touch to coordinate an online technical test as a first step in the interview process.
