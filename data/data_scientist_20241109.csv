Their next vision was to develop an IoT sticker, a computing element that can power itself by harvesting radio frequency energy, bringing connectivity and intelligence to everyday products and packaging, things previously disconnect from the IoT. This revolutionary mixture of cloud and semiconductor technology is being used by some of the world’s largest consumer, retail, food and pharmaceutical companies to change the way we make, distribute, sell, use and recycle products.

Our investors include Softbank, Amazon, Alibaba, Verizon, NTT DoCoMo, Qualcomm and PepsiCo.

We are growing fast and need people that want to be part of the journey, commercializing Sensing as a Service and enabling “Intelligence for Everyday Thing”.

About The Role

We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer with hands-on experience in building and deploying generative AI tools at scale. You will be part of a team responsible for developing cutting-edge AI agents and chatbots for internal and external use. Your focus will be on creating production-level AI systems that leverage advanced techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM Frameworks, and Vector Databases to enhance the functionality of these agents.

Additionally, you will contribute to Proof-of-Concept (PoC) projects with potential customers, collaborating across Wiliot’s diverse teams to drive data-driven solutions. This role allows you to work closely with the data, network, and tag teams to shape how AI and data tools integrate into broader business solutions.

Responsibilities:

Generative AI Tool Development:

Build and deploy generative AI agents and chatbots that can handle complex, real-world use cases, leveraging frameworks such as LangChain, LangGraph, and Llama-Index.


Integration with Data Systems:


Collaborate with cross-functional teams to ensure AI tools are integrated into our broader data infrastructure. This includes optimizing retrieval systems and ensuring the AI agents interact smoothly with large-scale knowledge bases and cloud environments.


Chatbot Development:


Develop and optimize chatbot frameworks that can handle both structured and unstructured queries. Integrate with APIs, custom tools, and knowledge bases to improve functionality and user experience.


PoC Contributions:


Participate in Proof-of-Concept (PoC) initiatives with potential customers. Collaborate with internal teams to deliver AI-driven solutions tailored to customer needs, providing insights and support that shape Wiliot’s product offerings.

Requirements:

Experience:

2-4 years of practical experience building and deploying generative AI models in production environments. Familiarity with the full lifecycle of AI projects, from model development and experimentation to deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement in production settings.


Technical Skills:


Proficient in frameworks such as LangChain and LangGraph for building AI agents. Experience with vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Milvus) and their integration with generative models. Knowledge of alternatives for agent-based architectures and how to assess them is highly preferred.


Programming & ML Frameworks:


Strong Python skills, with a solid understanding of ML libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow for building or fine-tuning models. Experience in version control with Git and setting up CI/CD pipelines for AI models (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).


AI in Production:


Proven ability to scale and optimize generative AI models in production environments, handling model retraining, performance monitoring, and optimization. Experience deploying large language models (LLMs) and chatbots in real-time systems.


Cloud & DevOps:


Experience with cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure, including deploying AI systems in cloud environments and using containerization tools like Docker and Kubernetes to ensure scalability and reliability.


Collaboration & Communication:


Excellent collaboration and communication skills. Ability to work effectively with cross-functional teams and align AI tools with business goals.

Preferred Skills:

Experience with Generative AI agents and tools for production environments.


Familiarity with advanced search technologies for retrieval-augmented generation.
Experience working with data pipelines and real-time data integration for AI systems.
Strong understanding of chatbot frameworks and API integration for enhancing AI agent capabilities.
Strong Data Science background.


Why Join Us?

At Wiliot, you’ll be working at the cutting edge of AI and IoT, contributing to innovative projects that have a real-world impact. We offer a collaborative, forward-thinking environment where you’ll have the opportunity to drive the development of advanced AI tools.

You will work closely with the Portfolio Manager on how your analysis could impact their universe and ultimately PnL.




It’s a given this role has technical elements but equally as important is the ability to communicate your analysis and really look to monetize that. As they look to monetize the data, creativity surrounding the data and analysis is very much encouraged. They need someone who enjoys the technical elements but also wants to combine them with the fundamentals of working close to the markets.




As a senior hire you will lead the most impactful projects, you will also play a part in mentoring some of the junior team members.
