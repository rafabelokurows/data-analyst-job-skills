You've probably architected and maintained the end-to-end lifecycle of AI/ML models, from development to deployment and monitoring.




Could you do that for a fleet of AI-driven bipedal robots?




To make things interesting, your solution will need to be spread across edge, on-prem, and cloud compute systems, while making no sacrifices in terms of latency, throughput, or availability.




A greenfield project, you’ll be making architectural decisions from day one. Given the cutting-edge field, there isn’t yet a consensus on how you best do this, you might well have a hand in creating one.




Working alongside experts from AI, Robotics, and Software Development, you’ll likely be a principal-level MLOps expert elsewhere. However, there isn’t the possibility of siloes here. You’ll contribute across the sum of MLOps/DevOps – from CICD to Kubernetes, to TensorFlow, PyTorch, and the AWS native ML tools.




Based in central London, your office will have a fully-fledged robotics lab within it. They want you on-site as much as possible, but three days will be the minimum.




Compensation will be broken down between, base and stock options.




If you want to break ground in a truly revolutionary space, I’d be keen to speak further and answer any questions.




No up-to-date CV required at this point.

Through the interactive courses, you will gain knowledge in Python, R, Machine Learning, AI, and much more. You will also complete mini projects to gain practical experience and test your skills while you study.

Step 2 - CompTIA Data+

CompTIA Data+ is an early-career data analytics certification for professionals tasked with developing and promoting data-driven business decision-making. It teaches Data Mining, Visualization, Data Governance & Data Analytics. In any industry, gaining official certifications is very important in the recruitment process. Therefore, this globally recognized certification will enhance your CV and make you stand out from the crowd.

Step 3 - Official Exam

The CompTIA Data+ exam will certify that you have knowledge and skills required to transform business requirements in support of data-driven decisions through mining and manipulating data, applying basic statistical methods, and analysing complex datasets while adhering to governance and quality standards. The exam is 90 minutes long and can be sat either in your local testing centre or online.

Step 4 - Practical Projects

Now that you have completed your theory training and official exams, you will be assigned 2 practical projects by your tutor. The projects are the most important part of the traineeship as it will showcase to employers that you have skills required to work in a data science role. The projects will use real world scenarios where you be utilising all of the skill that you have learned.

Whilst you are progressing through the projects, you will have the ongoing support from your personal tutor. Once both projects have been completed and given the final sign off, you will have completed the traineeship and will be ready to move onto the recruitment stage.
