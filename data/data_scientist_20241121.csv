What we look for


A product-oriented mindset and enthusiasm for contributing to user-facing products. For you, ML is a means to an end - you're focused on delivering value to customers
Excellent English communication skills, both spoken and written, that allow you to communicate effectively with cross-functional partners and mentor fellow engineers. In our distributed team setup, strong writing communication skills are essential
Hands-on, you value writing clear, simple, and maintainable code. You understand that code is read more often than it is written
You embrace a growth mindset. You always continue learning and always seek new challenges.
Over 3 years of industry experience applying machine learning to solve business problems and writing production ML pipelines



Bonus


Previous experience in PropTech
Proficient in working with geospatial data and leveraging geospatial features

We are looking for a Data Scientist to join Bain’s Advanced Analytics Group (AAG).  As part of AAG, you will work with other members of AAG, Bain Generalist Consultants and our AAG Factory team to build robust data solutions that interact with our Data Science and Machine Learning models to serve our clients needs. We achieve this in two distinct ways:

Working with consulting teams on short-term projects which involve developing software solutions
Developing and maintaining long-lasting products that support internal or clients needs

At Bain, we work with leading companies innovating with data, often involving building digital products.

Many times, in the early stages of experimentation, we have to develop immature digital products as proofs of concept. Those can go from deploying a microservice with a predictive model, to quickly implementing pipelines that integrate client data with the developed products/models.

When any of those tests show potential value, we need to scale them up and help the team capture that unlocked value. Sometimes, this means transforming an immature digital project or product into a stable, usable, and resilient one and bring the most value to our clients.

Because of this, we are searching for innovative and fresh minds that want to join us to create elegant yet practical solutions to deal with the most challenging problems.

Who we are looking for

We are not looking for an expert on a specific domain or analytics framework. Instead, we are seeking people who have strong Data Science experience and feel comfortable moving through different types of data analysis and modeling challenges.

We are looking for individuals with experience building data-driven solutions, training machine learning models and integrating advanced analytics into business processes. Also, people that has worked with diverse data sources across different domains, and who can collaborate with multidisciplinary teams to drive insights and create analytic solutions from data.

While you may already have experience with certain tools or platforms, we encourage you to continually learn and adopt new technologies as you move forward. We want you to see learning as a challenge to embrace, not a chore

What we expect from you:

Enjoy learning new methodologies, tools and technologies
Familiar with statistics, linear algebra, databases and programming
Write code in Python
Skilled at manipulating data, extracting insights and communicating them through visualizations
Experience training machine learning models – both supervised and unsupervised
Comfortable using Git for versioning and collaborating
Strong interpersonal and communication skills to coordinate with both technical and business oriented team members
Have 1 or more years of experience

We are interested in you working with an interdisciplinary team where there are other roles who code and for you to be a reference regarding data science. Also, we need you to feel comfortable at every stage of a project: whether you are putting together a prototype of a crazy idea (that we don’t know what it’s going to evolve into), building production projects or leading the continuous improvement of an ongoing product.

About us

At Bain we say “Champion the bold to achieve the extraordinary”. In the Advanced Analytics Group we deeply embody that statement; we put remarkable data innovators in front of the world's toughest challenges, delivering impact that goes way beyond businesses. By doing that, we aim to challenge the status quo and redefine the domains in which we work.

We are building the most influential data innovation hub in South America. We are looking for creative yet courageous professionals like you to play a key role in helping us pursue this endeavor.

What can you expect from us?

We are people centered and team players: we want to provide an awesome environment to work and grow. An environment where we care about people, our wellbeing and a healthy and vibrant long term development. We believe in a place where autonomy is at the core, and where servant leadership provides direction, guidance and motivation, enabling the best version of each of us so we can build teams based on trust and where we help others shine.

We deliver positive impact and challenge the status quo: we are obsessed with unleashing our clients full potential by developing quick and dirty data products that evolve fast through agile experimentation. We design a vision not conquered yet, and we only seek to make it a reality and bring true impact to the domains we work on. Be it a very complex operational mining process, an NGO’s educational challenge, a retailer’s e-commerce, or a climate change endeavor, we bring state-of-the-art advanced analytics techniques to create new superior realities for our clients.

We are playful and seek for uniqueness: complex problems require thinking out-of-the-box, giving room to challenging ideas and points of view. How we enable that? By nurturing creativity and having fun exploring novel paths and promoting curiosity and learning in empowered teams that take seriously their instincts and passions. We’ve seen over and over again that this never-ending learning philosophy make us better and stronger, broaden our capability range and enlighten our version in the future to tackle challenges that we haven’t seen before.

We’d love if:

You are a curious person.
You are obsessed by learning new things, tackling new problems and being constantly challenged.
You describe yourself as a proactive and creative person.
You don’t feel bad facing failure, instead you learn the reason behind it and learn from it.
You value learning from others, but you also love learning by yourself and teaching yourself new skills.
You value when things are well-written, so you put your best effort on it. Be it code, documentation or an email.
You feel comfortable reading, writing and speaking in English.
You speak Spanish or Portuguese (⭐️ if you dominate both).
You have strong communication skills and feel comfortable working with people that have different roles and seniority levels.
You enjoy working on constantly iterative processes.
You embrace a deep respect for diversity.
