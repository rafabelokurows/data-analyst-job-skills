          Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few roles based in offices. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.<br><br>The company is founder led, profitable and growing.

These solutions may be run on servers or on the cloud, on machines or on Kubernetes, on developer desktops, or as web services.<br><br>We serve the needs of individuals and community members as much as the needs of our Global 2000 and Fortune 500 customers; we make our primary work available free of charge and our Pro subscriptions are also available to individuals for personal use at no cost.
