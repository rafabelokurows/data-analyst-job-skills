Soils are the unsung hero in the fight against climate change. With your help we want to uncover and use this secret. As data engineer at Seqana you will acquire and harmonize data on soils to unlock the potential of soil carbon sequestration for climate protection.

About Seqana:

Seqana is an EU- and venture-backed start-up building monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) tools to drive soil carbon sequestration and the transition towards regenerative and climate-preserving agriculture.

One of the most powerful (and underutilized) solutions to climate change is capturing carbon in soils via regenerative agricultural practices. This approach has the potential for several times more climate impact than planting forests, while also providing extensive co-benefits such as erosion mitigation and improved water quality, food security, and biodiversity.

Existing solutions for MRV for the carbon market are one of the main drivers of cost and effort, and often the limiting factor for new project development. At Seqana, we combine satellite imagery, our extensive proprietary library of soil datasets, and machine learning to provide an accurate, cost-effective, and efficient MRV solution for soil organic carbon. Our product enables project developers, large corporations and NGOS with a scalable solution to measure and quantify the impact of their regenerative agricultural practices on soil carbon sequestration, enabling them to report credible CO2 reductions.

Tasks

Our growing team is looking for an ambitious and driven soil data scientist to help us quantify soil organic carbon and its sequestration by using better data. You will play a crucial part in ensuring and improving the quality of soil data we work with, and the accuracy of the statistical models derived from it. Your work will directly contribute to the advancement of our MRV and sampling tools, helping to drive effective climate solutions through innovative technology.

We're looking for someone who brings a deep understanding in soil science, an analytical mindset, and data science skills. You will be part of a passionate team that aims to have a direct positive impact on the world. We value proactivity, authenticity, creativity, and empathy in our company culture.

Impact you’ll own:


Manage the onboarding of new datasets and implement rigorous data quality processes
Apply a soil science perspective and ensure that our data pipelines and modeling approaches are grounded in a deep understanding of soil processes and dynamics
Standardize our data discovery, acquisition, and harmonization processes
Develop analytical data models and dashboards to serve the needs of insights and analytics
Collaborate with stakeholders across the company to constantly optimize the data infrastructure and associated processes



Requirements

What you bring:


A track record of research in soil science, particularly in SOC and its implications for climate change and agricultural land management
2-4 years of experience in data science roles or equivalent, with a strong foundation in statistical analysis
Proficiency in Python and SQL - with experience in automating data processing and conducting data analyses
Experience with soil sampling methods, laboratory analysis techniques, and understanding of SOC measurement best practices and standards
Ability to work and communicate effectively in an agile, fast-paced startup environment
A proactive, can-do attitude with the ability to quickly adapt, learn, and embrace change
Passion for environmental sustainability and climate tech



What makes you stand out:


Bonus: Knowledge of leading voluntary carbon standards and methodologies, e.g. VCS, Gold Standard or CAR
Bonus: Experience in carbon statistical modeling or process-based models such as Century, RothC, or DNDC
Bonus: Experience with machine learning, including model training and evaluation, is a big plus



Benefits

Benefits you can expect:


Be part of our highly motivated, committed, and international team with flat hierarchies that is working on solving one of societies’ biggest challenges: Climate Change
Witness and shape the evolution of a new business being built
Collaborative DevOps culture with opportunities for continuous learning and improvement
Work in a casual environment with flexible hours and some ability to work from home
Competitive salary, benefits, and compensation package
Drinks, snacks, team events, and your choice of hardware



Seqana is committed to building a workplace culture based on the values of proactivity, authenticity, creativity, and empathy, where equal employment opportunity is guaranteed to all applicants and team members regardless of their race, color, ethnicity, sex, sexual identity, religion, or disability. If this job intrigues you, but you’re thinking you might not have all of the qualifications, please do apply anyway. We are looking for well-rounded people from around the world who can contribute in more ways than just what is listed in this job description. We are excited to build a team that celebrates diversity in all its forms.

Join us if you want to advance climate action in your daily work and are open to new insights and opportunities everyday. Please apply with a short motivational letter and your CV.

Berlin based - m/f/d - full-time

What we do at Plato

Plato is building the digital backbone of the global trade economy. Starting with the $48T wholesale industry, we empower the modern wholesaler to connect their people and data in a single analytics and workflow hub. By leveraging data science and AI, we automate workflows and combat labor shortages, making SMB wholesalers competitive with large corporations.

Why we do what we do

The future of wholesale is data-driven. Unlike popular opinion, Industrial SMEs are ready to make the step to become more proactive in their processes but lack the technology to steer them to success. Our founders come from a wholesale family and gathered a rock star team of ex-Big Tech, VC, and top-tier consulting companies to reshape the operations of this $48tn industry. Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.

About Us

Chemical simulations – this might sound abstract and academic buts it’s much closer to everyday life than you think. Whether it's a smartphone, toothpaste, or the oil on a bicycle chain: all these products contain an incredible amount of chemical know-how. And in all these cases, the development process started in a lab at some point.

During hundreds of development cycles, researchers have worked their way toward the optimal properties of a material or a chemical agents. Until the ideal conductivity of a semiconductor is achieved, or the desired viscosity of a cosmetic product is given. This takes a lot of time and, of course, a lot of money.

We have the opinion that this can be done more easily nowadays! Quantistry Lab - our cloud-native simulation platform - replaces countless development cycles in the lab. It reduces the investment costs of researching companies, accelerates their R&D, and improves their environmental footprint at the same time. Our customers think that’s pretty cool, so do we. What about you?

Quantistry - The new way to R&D
