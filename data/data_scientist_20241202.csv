As a senior member of an engineering- and innovation-first company, you will be empowered to discuss, design, and implement solutions throughout our platform from ideation all the way to production.

A successful candidate should have a solid understanding of the full “AI” space, including machine learning, model training, and natural language processing. Knowing where large language models fall into this space and how they can best be utilized in conjunction with other ML tools and techniques is important, as is keeping up-to-date with the newest developments in LLMs/AI and being interested in experimenting with them.

Qualifications

What You’ll Do:


Ideate and discuss roadmap ideas with the rest of the organization and advise on how AI can be leveraged to create magical customer experiences
Act as an AI evangelist and teacher throughout the org, educating others on how it works and can best be utilized both for internal operations and throughout the user-facing product
Work with the rest of our development team to help establish the infrastructure and tooling required to leverage AI offerings
Plan, document, and develop AI features and tooling for the Sagetap marketplace and organization
Collaborate with, learn from, and teach others on the team about languages, tooling, techniques, etc.


What We're Looking For


3+ years professional working experience in AI/ML engineering
Strong foundations in computer science, data science, math, machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and generative AI concepts
3+ years experience with a programming language (we anticipate using Python for ML/AI initiatives, but we use Kotlin for the rest of our backend)
Experience with git or other version control systems
An empathetic mindset (for our users and the rest of our team), the ability to collaborate and communicate effectively, and a willingness and desire to learn
Experience with databases and confidence with core SQL preferred
Experience in an online marketplace is strongly preferred


What We Offer


Competitive salary.
Stock options.
Fully remote. Work from anywhere! However, we do like to have a significant overlap in working hours, so you should be willing to work on a schedule between UTC-9 and UTC-5.
Reasonable flexibility in hours. We’re a fully remote team across multiple timezones and with various responsibilities, so this is more of a “code in main"" than “butts in seats” sort of workplace. As long as you’re around for calls, can chime in when folks need help, and execute upon your commitments, then it’s up to you when, where, and how you work.
Medical, dental, and vision insurance.
Generous vacation and holiday policy.
Remote office equipment budget.


Diversity drives innovation, enables better decisions to support our customers, and inspires change for the better. We’re building a culture where differences are valued and welcomed. We work together to bring out the best in each other.
