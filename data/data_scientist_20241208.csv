From designing our data models to implementing the subtle interaction behaviors that differentiate good software from great software. We work closely with UI designers and are supported by our infrastructure team. We aim to delight users with both large new features and smaller, daily product enhancements—thanks to our continuous deployment architecture. We want to create a superlative user experience, down to the smallest details.

We are looking for a Staff Software Engineer to join the Data Management team in our Vancouver Office. The team plays a vital role in understanding the Asana data graph and ensuring the integrity and compliant use of data across the product. You’ll work on essential features touching the entire customer data lifecycle, such as data exports, object archiving, trashing & recovery, and audit logs. All of these are fundamental for Enterprise customers and involve handling and managing large-scale datasets to ensure smooth and secure operations.

Being part of this team will provide you with the opportunity to dive deep into Asana’s data graph, gaining a deep understanding of how data is managed at scale. While compliance is a key focus, our work goes beyond and empowers customers to efficiently manage their data across large, complex environments. You will implement efficient algorithms for handling vast datasets and work closely with cross-functional teams, including core infrastructure, product, and legal, to deliver scalable, secure solutions.

This role is based in our Vancouver office with an office-centric hybrid schedule. The standard in-office days are Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Most Asanas have the option to work from home on Wednesdays. Working from home on Fridays depends on the type of work you do and the teams with which you partner. If you're interviewing for this role, your recruiter will share more about the in-office requirements.

What You’ll Achieve


Work in a high-performance, dynamic team with a strong focus on velocity and software quality
Contribute to building a complex SaaS application that is a market leader in its segment
Work closely with Product Managers and Engineers to create simple and scalable technical solutions that have a strong impact on the application’s architecture and design.
Drive technical strategies that cross over other team surfaces and align with such teams and stakeholders to get buy-in and implement such strategies.
Be exposed to Asana’s core infrastructure, particularly how data is represented, stored and deleted in the storage layer.
Put to practice your strong knowledge of data structures, algorithms and scalability patterns in various technical aspects of the platform such as working with asynchronous jobs and efficiently traversing the Asana Work Graph.
Work with legal to implement data ownership rules, requiring simple and effective technical solutions to make this process easy and clear to customers.
Drive large, impactful projects, delivering features that will be rolled out and used in large organizations


About You


5+ years of software development experience with 2+ years mentoring/coaching other engineers on impactful software projects.
Experience working in ambiguous and complex technical spaces and creating clarity and alignment with partners and stakeholders.
Have a track record of designing and implementing solutions to complex business problems. You have skillfully influenced and got buy-in from stakeholders and other teams to adopt/implement these solutions.
Comfortable and autonomously debugging and fixing tricky issues in various parts of the software stack, particularly on the backend.
Have a strong breath of knowledge of software concepts and design patterns that you can comfortably apply to make technical solutions scalable and robust.
Excited about mentoring and coaching teammates and stakeholders and contributing to leveling the team
Experience driving projects of medium to large complexity.
You have a continuous improvement mindset and are never satisfied with the status quo, whether it's about the architecture, the code or the team's processes


At Asana, we're committed to building teams that include a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, as this is critical to helping us achieve our mission. If you're interested in this role and don't meet every listed requirement, we still encourage you to apply.

What We’ll Offer

Our comprehensive compensation package plays a big part in how we recognize you for the impact you have on our path to achieving our mission. We believe that compensation should be reflective of the value you create relative to the market value of your role. To ensure pay is fair and not impacted by biases, we're committed to looking at market value which is why we check ourselves and conduct a yearly pay equity audit.

For this role, the estimated base salary range is between $211,000 - $269,000 CAD. The actual base salary will vary based on various factors, including market and individual qualifications objectively assessed during the interview process. The listed range above is a guideline, and the base salary range for this role may be modified.

In addition to base salary, your compensation package may include additional components such as equity, sales incentive pay (for most sales roles), and benefits. If you're interviewing for this role, speak with your Talent Acquisition Partner to learn more about the total compensation and benefits for this role.

We strive to provide equitable and competitive benefits packages that support our employees worldwide and include:

Debug problems found by our automated test programs and fix the problems.
Work on a team implementing, testing, and debugging solutions to larger routing protocol problems.
Worth with Customer Support Engineers to analyze problems in customer networks and provide fixes for those problems when needed in the form of new software releases or software patches.
Work with the System Test Engineers to analyze problems found in their tests and provide fixes for those problems.
Mentor new and junior engineers to bring them up to speed in Arista’s software development environment.
Review and contribute to the specifications and implementations written by other team members.
Help to create a schedule for the implementation and debugging tasks, update that schedule weekly, and report it to the project lead.


Qualifications


BSc, MS or Ph.D. in Computer Science/Electrical Engineering/Computer Engineering with 2+ years of related post graduate work experience
Knowledge of C, C++, and/or python.
Knowledge of UNIX or Linux.
Understanding of L2/L3 networking including at least one of the following areas is desirable:
IP routing protocols, such as RIP, OSPF, BGP, IS-IS, or PIM.
Layer 2 features such as 802.1d bridging, the 802.1d Spanning Tree Protocol, the 802.1ax Link Aggregation Control Protocol, the 802.1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol, or RFC 1812 IP routing.
Ability to utilize, test, and debug packet forwarding engine and a hardware component’s vendor provided software libraries in your solutions.
Infrastructure functions related to distributed systems such as messaging, signalling, databases, and command line interface techniques.
Hands on experience in the design and development of ethernet bridging or routing related software or distributed systems software is desirable.
Hands on experience with enterprise or service provider class Ethernet switch/router system software development, or significant PhD level research in the area of network routing and packet forwarding.
Applied understanding of software engineering principles.
Strong problem solving and software troubleshooting skills.
Ability to design a solution to a small-sized problem, and implement that solution without outside help. Able to work on a small team solving a medium-sized problem with limited oversight.


Additional Information



The new hire base pay for this role has a pay range of $95,000 to $145,000. Arista offers different pay ranges based on work location, so that we can offer consistent and competitive pay appropriate to the market. The actual base pay offered will be based on a wide range of factors, including skills, qualifications, relevant experience, and work location.
