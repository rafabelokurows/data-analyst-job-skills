Imagine yourself building the next breakthrough AI/Machine-Learning technology, enabling ""AI for everyone"" at the start of the company's explosive growth.

Super.AI is used by global enterprises across all industries, from banks, logistics, and insurance companies to Testing, Inspection, and certification (TIC) or retail companies. Super.AI has created the world’s most advanced AI automation platform to extract data from any document with guaranteed quality. We enable companies to leverage the latest AI models, including. LLMs, and super.AI Data Processing Crowd for human-in-the-loop (HITL) review to automate business processes end-to-end with guaranteed results.

Your profile

What You'll Do


Measure and ensure the high-quality output of AI workloads for our enterprise customers.
Deploy and manage production workloads for a global customer base.
Write, rewrite, and extend Python code, and deploy it to containers (e.g., Docker).
Conduct local testing using tools like Jupyter Notebook.
Integrate AI cloud solutions and adapt them to our large-scale use cases.
Perform prompt engineering for customer use cases.
Fine-tune and deploy Large Language Models (LLMs).
Develop software that scales to meet the demands of high-load customer workloads.


What We Are Looking For


Smart, humble, hardworking, and collaborative
By smart we don't necessarily mean high IQ (although a huge plus), but an affinity toward learning. We want to automate as much as possible so we can focus on the few things that require human intelligence and creativity.
By humble we don't mean submissive or unambitious, we mean it in the same way Roger Federer is humble.
By hardworking, we don't mean long hours (be with your family). What we mean is while you're here you're doing the best work of your life. It means being disciplined, professional, focused, gritty, resilient, and resourceful.
By collaborative, we don't mean submissive or deferential, it means taking leadership from everywhere. ""I'm taking responsibility to fix this system"", if there's a lack of trust ""I'm going to address it"" if goals are unclear ""I'm going to deal with it"", it's about being a meritocracy
All four of the above are required. We all know people missing one of these and it's not nice to work with them (e.g. someone who is smart and hardworking but not humble and collaborative).
Paradoxical
The people we like the most are smart but humble
Wants to win no matter what, but will not cross lines of integrity to get there
Strong beliefs weakly held, etc.

Your Experience


3-5 years of professional experience in software development.
Proven ability to work backwards from customer needs to deliver AI-based features that meet those needs.
Ability to organize and prioritize competing workloads.
Familiarity with distributed systems and cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
Solid understanding of machine learning principles.
Experience with container frameworks such as Docker or Kubernetes.
Proficiency in using REST APIs.


If this resonates with you, it would be amazing to get to know each other.

Why us?

At super.AI our mission is to make AI accessible to all and use AI to enrich the human experience and make the world a better place. We are a group of smart, creative people who have come together from MIT, Microsoft Research, AWS, Google, and Apple to work toward that mission. As a first step towards that goal, we have built an AI platform to help businesses make sense of unstructured data. Our culture is collaborative and fun that puts customers first.

About Us


We believe AI is going to be the most impactful technology ever invented. It may be the last technology we ever needed to invent as humans. We don’t want it to be in the hands of the few, but the hands of the many. Our technology promises to transform the way AI is created and consumed to make this vision possible.
We are searching for the best-of-the-best to build a massive company, but at the same time a company where people are happy with their lives, feel healthy, passionate and satisfied.
We're at an inflection point, so you will have the opportunity to shape things and see the company grow
Although super.AI is young, this is not our first rodeo: our CEO previously founded a few hundred person company, and between us we've held senior positions at Google, Amazon, Adobe, Microsoft, Docusign and others

Cherry Ventures is supporting our portfolio with this hire

Berlin based - m/f/d - full-time

What we do at Plato

Plato is building the digital backbone of the global trade economy. Starting with the $48T wholesale industry, we empower the modern wholesaler to connect their people and data in a single analytics and workflow hub. By leveraging data science and AI, we automate workflows and combat labor shortages, making SMB wholesalers competitive with large corporations.

🎯 Why we do what we do

The future of wholesale is data-driven. Unlike popular opinion, Industrial SMEs are ready to make the step to become more proactive in their processes but lack the technology to steer them to success. Our founders come from a wholesale family and gathered a rock star team of ex-Big Tech, VC, and top-tier consulting companies to reshape the operations of this $48tn industry. Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.

🔮 What we’re looking for

As a Data Scientist at Plato you will be tackling the complex challenge of building versatile models that serve multiple industries, ranging from construction and steel to technical and HVAC wholesalers. Each industry presents unique data sets and requires a tailored approach.

You will have the opportunity to develop a variety of models, such as recommendation engines, dynamic pricing systems, churn prediction models, and customer segmentation algorithms. You will be responsible for the entire lifecycle of these models, from creation to deployment, and ensuring they scale across different industries.

Our platform generates a wealth of data from user interactions, and a key part of your role will be feeding this data back into the models to continuously improve their performance. You’ll collaborate closely with our data engineering and product teams to ensure our portfolio of data products provide value to our users.

🚀 What you’d be working on


Develop, test, and deploy a wide range of machine learning models, including recommendation systems, dynamic pricing models, churn prediction algorithms, and customer categorisation systems.
Tackle the challenge of building adaptable models that can be customized across various industries, such as construction, technical, and HVAC wholesale, ensuring that industry-specific needs are met.
Continuously refine and update models based on real-time platform data and customer feedback to ensure they evolve with our users’ needs.
Collaborate with data engineers and ML engineers to build efficient data pipelines that feed into and optimise machine learning models.
Recommendations System knowledge
Design experiments to assess model performance and iteratively improve accuracy and scalability.
Implement automated model retraining and monitoring systems to ensure that models remain relevant and continue to perform in production environments.
Work closely with the product and engineering teams to align model outputs with business goals and deliver actionable insights to customers.
Build processes to efficiently manage the lifecycle of machine learning models, including versioning, experimentation, and reproducibility across different deployments.



🏅 What you bring along


5+ years of professional experience in data science, with a strong focus on the development and deployment of machine learning models.
Hands-on experience with recommender systems is highly valued—this will be a core component of the role.
A strong generalist mindset, capable of owning the full product lifecycle—from translating business problems into data science solutions to building and maintaining models in production.
Experience in building and running machine learning models end-to-end; you will own your models, ensuring they run smoothly in production and are continuously optimised.
Experience with MLFlow for model tracking and lifecycle management is desirable.
Hands-on experience with data engineering tools and platforms; a background in Databricks is highly valued.
Familiarity with NLP techniques is a plus, especially for customer segmentation and categorisation tasks.
Ability to wear multiple hats and thrive in a startup environment where flexibility and initiative are key.
Proficiency in German is plus.
Based in Germany/EU: We are unfortunately not able to sponsor visas - for this role, you will need to possess an existing EU/German work permit.



🛠️ The tools you will be using


Python
PySpark
Databricks
MLFlow
Model Serving Technologies

About Merchant Group at Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business. Their core mission is to provide merchants with self-service tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use.

About The Merchant Analytics Team

Merchant Analytics is an embedded analytics function within the Merchant Group. The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4-5+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

🎄Please note that we might have delays due to the festive season.

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.<br><br>The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.<br><br><strong>Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion<br><br></strong>We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.<br><br>Join us today to build Wolt together!<br><br>

What we do at Plato

Plato is building the digital backbone of the global trade economy. Starting with the $48T wholesale industry, we empower the modern wholesaler to connect their people and data in a single analytics and workflow hub. By leveraging data science and AI, we automate workflows and combat labor shortages, making SMB wholesalers competitive with large corporations.

Why we do what we do

The future of wholesale is data-driven. Unlike popular opinion, Industrial SMEs are ready to make the step to become more proactive in their processes but lack the technology to steer them to success. Our founders come from a wholesale family and gathered a rock star team of ex-Big Tech, VC, and top-tier consulting companies to reshape the operations of this $48tn industry. Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.

What we’re looking for

Implement model serving solutions to deploy and manage real-time inference pipelines.
Work closely with our product, engineering, and data science teams to build and maintain a data platform that scales with our growing customer base.
Establish and enforce best practices for data and ML pipeline versioning, experimentation, and reproducibility.



What you bring along

Healthcare workers speak freely and our AI automatically generates the correct structured forms.

We are YC-funded and grow quickly. Our customers like Caritas, Contilia, and TÜV NORD create thousands of documentation records every single day.

Today speech recognition is primarily used as a “fun” gimmick for consumers, who set kitchen timers with their Alexa speaker. We build a completely new class of speech-powered applications, to supercharge the professional workforce. By focusing on individual workflows like healthcare or vehicle inspections, we create truly magical user experiences and save each user 30 minutes per day in administrative work. Don’t believe it? See for yourself in our 3-minute product demo (https://youtu.be/AlkVD4OwCQk).

The entire system is built in-house, giving us full control over the user experience, product design, NLP models, and speech recognition. Our custom speech recognition models already outperform Google with 10x lower error rates and we are just getting started!

If you ever wanted to work at the bleeding edge of product design, applied machine learning research, and MLOps, you should apply. You get to build products with daily user feedback, train AI models on real-world data, and ship to production on a daily basis.

At voize new software is deployed to production every 5h on average! We deploy new AI models every 24h and have one of the largest speech data sets for medical documentation.

Tasks

We’re looking for team members who enjoy talking to customers, iterating & shipping quickly.

As an ML developer, you will take core responsibility for the design, training, evaluation, and deployment of our deep learning models in the space of speech recognition and NLP. The models you will build and work on are at the heart of our applications and are directly impacting the end-user. You get to engineer large self-supervised trainings as well as fast inference for mobile devices and hosted environments.

Requirements

You should be comfortable with the following tech stack


Python
Deep Learning Frameworks (preferably PyTorch)
Speech recognition or NLP & Transformer models
Typical Software Engineering skills like Git, Docker, etc
Bonus: Kotlin, React Native / Typescript



Team Work & Personal Skills:


You have to be able to work in a team, communicate clearly, take ownership over your work and share feedback with your teammates.
You need to feel empathy for the user and have a deep passion for great product experiences. You will talk to users, listen to their feedback, understand their daily challenges, and translate those insights into product decisions.
You need great time management skills and be self-sufficient. Your colleges have to be able to rely on you.



Language & Region


You need to be able to speak German fluently. (especially to talk to customers)
You need to live in Germany and be legally allowed to work in Germany.



Benefits


voize is based in Berlin and has a remote-friendly workplace.
We offer flexible work hours and believe that you know best when you want to work
We have an open culture and regular team events
As a fast-growing startup, there are new challenges daily and plenty of learning opportunities for your personal development
Own part of the company through stock option packages



Interview Process

To help us determine that we are both a great fit for each other and are happy to change the world together for years to come, we run a 4 stage interview process. This process is usually completed in 2-3 weeks.


First Call with the founder (Remote):



This is a more informal video call with you and one of our founders, to get to know you, and share more details on the role. Together we want to determine if this role is a great fit for you and get a basic understanding of your personal interests and technical & soft skills.


Technical Interview with CTO (Remote):



In this video call, we want to learn more about your technical skills and past projects you have worked on.

The best way to impress us is by showing us a project you’ve built and walking us through the 2 hardest technical/design decisions you had to make.

Mostly, we want to know that you can code and ship fairly involved systems, and speak to them with clarity on the details. This tends to be a good indication that an engineer had strong ownership and showed autonomy in making a product or technical decisions.


Pair Programming Challenge (Remote):



At this stage, we want to show you the kind of challenges we are facing on a daily basis. In a pair programming setting, you will get access to a portion of our system and will debug an Error we’ve introduced or build a prototype of a new feature.


Onboarding



If you and our team both see a great culture and technical fit, we will send you a job offer and walk you through our onboarding process.

In your first week, you will ship your very own first feature to production! We will prepare a great first task, help you along the way and celebrate the release and direct user feedback.

Our AI-focused software connects distributors with their customers to operate waste-free and efficiently. A problem of this magnitude requires a massive scale and only the best people will be able to solve it. Are you in?

Here’s what we’re up to: https://bit.ly/4fyXonB

We are seeking a Senior Machine Learning Engineer ready to make a true impact.

At Choco we went within 16 months from 0 AI revenue to AI driving 100% of our new revenue. We took AI seriously, not for window dressing, but to bring us to our vision faster and to drive a significant part of our revenue. Because only when AI drives a majority of revenue is it at the core of the company.

We have assembled an absolutely world-class AI team that you will be working with. We work with cutting-edge tech and are an innovation driver in our industry and the broader European ecosystem.

You’ll need to be at the forefront of applied AI research and development, staying on top of industry advancements and constantly seeking ways to improve, validate, and deploy the latest models effectively.

Excellence in engineering skills is a must, as you will be responsible for ensuring our AI models run efficiently, can scale, and meet the rigorous demands of our platform.

We’re looking for someone who thrives in a fast-paced, high-execution environment—someone who can learn quickly, adapt to new technologies, take ownership and deliver impactful solutions. You will collaborate with an amazing team, working alongside peers, engineers, and other experts to help us realize our ambitious vision.

One week, you might be validating hypotheses and assumptions, demonstrating your conclusions in a defendable and reproducible way. The next week, you could be building a proof of concept, and in the third, you'll be shipping the first iteration of your work directly to our users.


Lead end-to-end development of AI and ML systems, incl. experimentation, deployment, optimization and monitoring
Collaborate with and be part of cross-functional teams to integrate sophisticated models into our systems
Carry the team through support, coaching, feedback, tooling, documentation, establishing best practices and knowledge sharing
Develop innovative solutions for complex business challenges


Your Responsibilities


Understand and interpret complex business and customer challenges, translating them into actionable AI solutions.
Ensure AI systems are scalable, efficient, and effective.
Lead by example, demonstrating a strong work ethic, quick iterations, and a commitment to continuous delivery. Embrace and drive Choco's ambitious goals, thriving in a fast-paced, challenging startup environment.
Employ an agile approach, emphasizing swift delivery, responsiveness to feedback, and continuous improvement.


What We’re Looking For


Expertise with LLMs: Hands-on experience with state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4o, including safely deploying them in production environments. Familiarity with applications and architectures involving conversational agents, fine-tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
Search and Recommendations: Proven expertise in building personalized search and recommendation systems, with a deep understanding of information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP) challenges like Named Entity Recognition (NER).
Engineering Excellence: Strong programming and engineering skills, with the ability to design, build, and maintain scalable AI systems.
Communication and Collaboration: Clear, effective communication skills, with the ability to translate complex AI concepts into practical, actionable solutions for cross-functional teams.
Startup Mindset: Experience in fast-paced environments, with the ability to navigate ambiguity, take ownership of projects, and - most importantly - get shit done


At Choco, we're experiencing rapid growth and leading the AI revolution in the food supply chain. Our industry-leading Choco AI solution has achieved strong product-market fit, demonstrating the impact of our approach. As a Machine Learning Engineer here, you'll work end-to-end, from conducting deep-dive analyses to building and deploying production-ready ML and AI systems.

Choco was founded in 2018 in Berlin. Now, we are a dedicated team of over 200 Chocorians across Europe and the US. We seek hungry and humble individuals who embrace hard work, put our team first, and are committed to building a lasting company. Our mission demands urgency and speed while maintaining a long-term vision.

Job Description

Strategy, Planning and Budget

Strategy, Planning and Budget operates at the heart of the Treasury to develop the Department’s overall strategy and business plan, assess performance and risk, and help deliver its objectives with a large, flexible project team who work on ministerial priorities across the whole range of the department’s policy responsibilities. We also co-ordinate the Chancellor’s annual Budget, the Finance Bill and the Treasury’s tax strategy, as well as coordinate the Treasury’s responses to the COVID-19 Public Inquiry and provide support to ministers and officials who are Inquiry witnesses. SPB also promotes excellent policymaking across the department and houses the Darlington Leadership Team, which works to ensure the successful delivery of the Darlington Economic Campus (DEC).

About The Team

The Growth Delivery Unit (GDU) is a new team established to drive delivery of the Chancellor’s priorities and support her leadership of the growth mission – the government’s ambition to grow the UK economy. We do that by combining policy, analytical, project management and data science skills to monitor the progress of policies and projects from announcement to actually delivering real-world outcomes; identify when and why progress is being blocked; and intervene to overcome those barriers. This role is part of our recruitment to put the GDU on a permanent footing across both our London and Darlington offices.

We are a friendly team with a can-do attitude. Our work can be fast paced but we work flexibly to support each other. We offer lots of development support to help you thrive. Diversity and team wellbeing are very important to us. Our work is relatable and interesting because it is focused on priority issues which are often in the news and have tangible impacts.

About The Job

This is a new role, working directly on a priority of the Chancellor and her team, shaping work on the Growth Mission.

As data scientist, you will be instrumental in the success of priority growth programmes. You will shape the journey of this data from source to use by system leaders, exercising significant range in the techniques you choose to deploy. You will help implement data engineering solutions, understanding a range of architectures (including using the cloud) and data transformation tools.

You will help collect data, conduct high quality analysis, create engaging visualisations and develop insights, all to inform critical decision making by the Chancellor, HMT ministers, and Civil Service Leaders. You will identify opportunities to add statistical insight, and use a variety of data analytics techniques (such as data mining and prescriptive and predictive analytics) for complex data analysis through the whole data life cycle.

You will also contribute to the cross-government data science community, engaging with a range of stakeholders to champion the value of data science. GDU aims to be a centre of excellence within HMT applying cutting edge technologies to policy and delivery problems, drawing on capabilities in Python and cloud computing.

Key Responsibilities


Support the Range E and E2 analytical team in developing and maintaining innovative, clear, and engaging analytical products. Use Python and tools like Plotly Dash to create insights and interactive dashboards that effectively communicate delivery progress on priority projects.
Applying data science and other analytical techniques to extract delivery-relevant insight from data and communicating those insights in a clear and engaging manner for senior decision makers.
Maintain and build data flows and pipelines from a wide range of sources across Whitehall by establishing relationships and promoting technological solutions such as APIs. Maintenance of said pipelines in Microsoft Azure.
Excellent communication skills, and ability to build and maintaining relationships across HMT. Build and maintain strong relationships with analytical teams in No10, CO and across government to ensure Ministers are presented with a single source of truth.

Benefits

We offer competitive salaries, access to a generous pension scheme, 30 days’ leave per annum (pro-rata for part-time/fixed-term), a season ticket loan scheme and access to a comprehensive range of personal and professional development opportunities. In addition, we offer a range of work life balance and family friendly, inclusive employment policies, flexible working arrangements, and campus facilities.

Centre for Net Zero 🌎 – Data /

Fixed Term Contract /

Hybrid



Centre for Net Zero (CNZ) is a not-for-profit, impact-driven energy research institute, founded by the Octopus Energy Group. Operating autonomously, our goal is to accelerate the journey to a fully sustainable, global energy system ♻️ 🌎

While technology is transforming the energy sector, both modelling and policymaking are typically based on data from the past. By contrast, CNZ can access unprecedented insight into future human behaviours by leveraging Octopus Energy’s global customer base. We design and run research and field trials around the world to generate and democratise data about the future energy system.

We are seeking an Economist/Data Scientist to join our Trials and Analysis team at the Centre for Net Zero (CNZ) for an 18-month fixed-term contract. CNZ operates a hybrid working arrangement, where most colleagues come to the office 2-3 times per week.

The Trials and Analysis team leads the design and delivery of field trials and quasi-experimental analyses, in collaboration with a range of delivery partners – including companies within the Octopus Energy Group, including Octopus Energy Limited, the largest electricity supplier in the UK, Octopus Electric Vehicles, Octopus Electroverse, and Octopus Energy Group companies supplying energy to consumers in France, Spain, Italy, Japan, Texas, and other markets; as well as external partners such as National Energy System Operator and OVO Energy.

The main responsibilities of this role are the design and analysis of various randomised control trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental analyses related to low carbon technology adoption, automation, energy flexibility, and the intersection of these topics. In turn, our vision is that this research shapes policy for the better.

What You'll Do


Trial design: Designing field trials and drafting pre-analysis plans, often in close collaboration with delivery partners within and outside Octopus Energy Group – this requires a pragmatic approach given the commercial sensitivity of the data we work with and the interventions we evaluate.
Implementation: Working closely with a project manager on our team to help the delivery partner(s) deliver the trial in a way that maintains fidelity to the pre-analysis plan and enables rigorous analysis once complete.
Data analysis: Carrying out data analyses of our field trials as well as conducting quasi-experimental analyses, structuring these analyses to turn them into high quality reporting.
Reporting: Contributing to and leading the write-up of these analyses into academic papers and accessible, policy-facing materials. At CNZ, this phase of a project is especially collaborative, involving one or more rounds of feedback from other members of CNZ.
Partner engagement: Liaising with partners, managing and coordinating implementation across partners, and communicating updates to key partners and external stakeholders.



Our reporting generally takes two main forms: 1) academic journal articles, and 2) accessible, policy-facing materials.


We will generally assign an individual data scientist to lead on specific trials and quasi-experimental analyses. You will work closely with the Director of the Trials and Analysis team, as well as our Chief Economist, in the writing of academic journal articles based on the trial or quasi-experimental analysis. Here are examples of this output for the impact of heat pumps on energy demand and the impact of the demand flexibility service on energy demand. We also do smaller pieces of analysis for blogposts or white papers for policymakers.
To create the policy-facing materials, the Trials and Analysis team then works closely with CNZ’s external affairs and communications team to package our analyses into high-quality reporting that is useful for policymakers.



In summary, we are looking for someone who has the intellectual capacity to perform and report high-quality analyses for diverse audiences. CNZ prioritises collaboration and distributed decision-making with technical and non-technical staff across the organisation at all stages of research and reporting. In this vein, you will work closely with a range of members of CNZ – other researchers in CNZ’s Trials and Analysis team, as well as the Director of the team and our Chief Economist; project managers who liaise with partners and assist you in ensuring the fidelity of implementation to the pre-analysis plan; CNZ’s External Affairs team, to package our analyses into high-quality reporting and relevant recommendations; and CNZ’s leadership team, to ensure our research delivers as much impact as possible.

What You'll Need


Experience designing and analysing randomised controlled trials
Experience managing multiple simultaneous projects, with an ability to prioritise and adapt to changing circumstances
Experience handling and analysing large amounts of data, using clear, maintainable code, ideally in R or Python
Experience communicating coherently and handling multiple stakeholdersExperience delivering research collaboratively as part of a larger team
Experience setting up and analysing quasi-experimental designs (such as staggered difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity designs)



It would be great if you also have…


Experience working in energy is great, but not critical – we’re looking for curiosity and an eagerness to learn more about the energy industry
Experience writing accessible, policy-facing summaries of researchExperience in empirical industrial organisation or public finance
Experience working directly with policymakers as well as academics
Facility using SQL to wrangle and process data



Sounds good, what's next? ⚡️


We recommend to apply soon as you can, as applications will close on January 1st 2025. Once you’ve submitted your application, our Talent team will review and provide feedback—along with details about the next steps, if you’re successful. We plan to make an offer in January 2025, with a flexible start date to suit your schedule



Here’s what to expect, if you're successful:


An initial call with our Talent team to discuss your experience, motivations & the role within CNZ
Task & interview: You’ll complete a task, followed by an online interview with the CNZ team to go over your findings
Final interview: Either on-site or virtual, depending on your location and availability



Wondering what the salary for this role is? Just ask us! On a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Octopus - what's more important to us is finding the right octofit!

Octopus Energy is a unique culture. An organisation where people learn, decide, and build quicker. Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about! We won best company to work for in 2022, on Glassdoor we were voted 50 best places to work in 2022 and our Group CEO, Greg has recorded a podcast about our culture and how we empower our people. We’ve also been placed in the top 10 companies for senior leadership

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.




Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.




Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.




As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is to maximise business impact within one of many business areas. You will help answer questions like:





Which markets/cities should we enter next?


How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?


What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?


How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?


What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?


How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?


What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?


How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?





The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.




Requirements





A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)


Experience conducting A/B experiments


Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences


A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset


Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems


A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail


A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact


Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems

We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & BenefitsAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




DiversityAt Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

Join our startup-to-scaleup journey as an AI/ML Data Scientist. In this fully remote role, working from anywhere in Canada, you'll be part of an interdisciplinary team innovating our flagship assessment platform, Casper, with AI.

Working at the intersection of machine learning innovation and ethical AI in higher education, you'll work on complex, ambiguous problems, and lead the end-to-end design, build, and deployment of an AI-powered evaluation system.

This role offers you, a machine learning professional with advanced proficiency in Python and deep knowledge of ML libraries, the chance to work without a predefined playbook and grow your career with a people-focused company that values work-life balance, invests in learning, and creates products with real-world impact on education, admissions, and social equity.

The Future We're Building

Imagine a world powered by everyone's full potential.

That's what we're building at Acuity Insights.

Our company was founded on the need for a higher education admissions method that looks beyond academic performance and considers the whole student—their unique qualities, experiences, and strengths.

Today, our solutions help discover, nurture and realize people's potential, supporting holistic success from admissions to graduation for students, education programs, and higher education institutions across North America, the U.K., Australia, and the Gulf.

Our core assessment product, Casper, provides education programs with a more holistic view of applicants by evaluating their soft skills. Incorporating Casper's insights into the admissions process results in a larger applicant pool, enables student success, and graduates better professionals. Since 2014, Casper has been adopted by over 600 higher education programs, and more than 1 million applicants have registered to take the test.

With our core education program management solution, One45, we help medical schools and other health professions programs optimize the complex processes and critical components of their curriculum and student assessments to generate data-informed insights needed to graduate competent future healthcare professionals.

With our fast-growing data and insights solution, Analytics, we leverage critical integrations with our data warehouse and powerful dashboards to provide medical schools with deep insights and intelligence on student and program performance, powering real-time decision-making and continuous quality improvement.

Join our startup-to-scaleup journey as an AI/ML Data Scientist. In this fully remote role, working from anywhere in Canada, you'll be part of an interdisciplinary team innovating our flagship assessment platform, Casper, with AI.

Working at the intersection of machine learning innovation and ethical AI in higher education, you'll work on complex, ambiguous problems, and lead the end-to-end design, build, and deployment of an AI-powered evaluation system.

This role offers you, a machine learning professional with advanced proficiency in Python and deep knowledge of ML libraries, the chance to work without a predefined playbook and grow your career with a people-focused company that values work-life balance, invests in learning, and creates products with real-world impact on education, admissions, and social equity.

The Future We're Building

Imagine a world powered by everyone's full potential.

That's what we're building at Acuity Insights.

Our company was founded on the need for a higher education admissions method that looks beyond academic performance and considers the whole student—their unique qualities, experiences, and strengths.

Today, our solutions help discover, nurture and realize people's potential, supporting holistic success from admissions to graduation for students, education programs, and higher education institutions across North America, the U.K., Australia, and the Gulf.

Our core assessment product, Casper, provides education programs with a more holistic view of applicants by evaluating their soft skills. Incorporating Casper's insights into the admissions process results in a larger applicant pool, enables student success, and graduates better professionals. Since 2014, Casper has been adopted by over 600 higher education programs, and more than 1 million applicants have registered to take the test.

With our core education program management solution, One45, we help medical schools and other health professions programs optimize the complex processes and critical components of their curriculum and student assessments to generate data-informed insights needed to graduate competent future healthcare professionals.

With our fast-growing data and insights solution, Analytics, we leverage critical integrations with our data warehouse and powerful dashboards to provide medical schools with deep insights and intelligence on student and program performance, powering real-time decision-making and continuous quality improvement.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$128,600 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Join our startup-to-scaleup journey as an AI/ML Data Scientist. In this fully remote role, working from anywhere in Canada, you'll be part of an interdisciplinary team innovating our flagship assessment platform, Casper, with AI.

Working at the intersection of machine learning innovation and ethical AI in higher education, you'll work on complex, ambiguous problems, and lead the end-to-end design, build, and deployment of an AI-powered evaluation system.

This role offers you, a machine learning professional with advanced proficiency in Python and deep knowledge of ML libraries, the chance to work without a predefined playbook and grow your career with a people-focused company that values work-life balance, invests in learning, and creates products with real-world impact on education, admissions, and social equity.

The Future We're Building

Imagine a world powered by everyone's full potential.

That's what we're building at Acuity Insights.

Our company was founded on the need for a higher education admissions method that looks beyond academic performance and considers the whole student—their unique qualities, experiences, and strengths.

Today, our solutions help discover, nurture and realize people's potential, supporting holistic success from admissions to graduation for students, education programs, and higher education institutions across North America, the U.K., Australia, and the Gulf.

Our core assessment product, Casper, provides education programs with a more holistic view of applicants by evaluating their soft skills. Incorporating Casper's insights into the admissions process results in a larger applicant pool, enables student success, and graduates better professionals. Since 2014, Casper has been adopted by over 600 higher education programs, and more than 1 million applicants have registered to take the test.

With our core education program management solution, One45, we help medical schools and other health professions programs optimize the complex processes and critical components of their curriculum and student assessments to generate data-informed insights needed to graduate competent future healthcare professionals.

With our fast-growing data and insights solution, Analytics, we leverage critical integrations with our data warehouse and powerful dashboards to provide medical schools with deep insights and intelligence on student and program performance, powering real-time decision-making and continuous quality improvement.

Backed by National Geographic, the Environmental Defense Fund, Canada’s Ocean Supercluster, and many more, we stand at the forefront of AI for ocean conservation & protection. Our software has been deployed by governments, Indigenous nations, scientists, NGOs, and industry around the world. 




What you'll be doing

We’re excited to be pushing the boundaries of what is possible in computer vision: creating grounded visual reasoning & fine-grained classification, and searching for absolutely anything in thousands of hours of video footage. What you’ll be doing is extending our NeurIPS workshop paper across several domains, scaling it to thousands of classes, and bridging the gap between video understanding models and our methods. We’ll provide the dedicated cloud GPUs and research autonomy for you to keep pushing the boundaries of visual reasoning.




You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside our engineering team to bring this applied research into reality, watching as your research turns into real products in just a few weeks. And you’ll get to publish to conferences and journals too.




Impact and scope of work

You will have ownership over mission-critical research, propelling us towards the frontier of ocean tech and our goal of end-to-end visual automation. In this mix of machine learning research and research engineering, you will:

Develop state-of-the-art machine learning models that can reason about visual data and retrieve relevant answers from external knowledge sources. 
Research, implement, and optimize for various tasks, including object detection, species classification, and multi-object tracking for scalable ocean vision systems and environmental monitoring.
Devise better data-driven models for information retrieval, hierarchical classification, multi-modal fusion, generation and media understanding (CV & NLP).
Collaborate with engineers to translate research into products, as well as communicating research plans, progress, results, and impact to the whole organization and in conference/journal papers.
Collaborate and work across teams to develop concepts that advance the entire product pipeline, all the way to production (infrastructure, software, data collection, machine learning, etc.).
Conduct research that enables learning the semantics of data across multiple modalities (images, video, text, physical sensors, and other modalities).




You will also get visibility of the business and product side, and see how OnDeck is commercializing machine learning systems and infrastructure to deliver recurring value to customers and real change to ocean sustainability.
