Join our startup-to-scaleup journey as an AI/ML Data Scientist. In this fully remote role, working from anywhere in Canada, you'll be part of an interdisciplinary team innovating our flagship assessment platform, Casper, with AI.

Working at the intersection of machine learning innovation and ethical AI in higher education, you'll work on complex, ambiguous problems, and lead the end-to-end design, build, and deployment of an AI-powered evaluation system.

This role offers you, a machine learning professional with advanced proficiency in Python and deep knowledge of ML libraries, the chance to work without a predefined playbook and grow your career with a people-focused company that values work-life balance, invests in learning, and creates products with real-world impact on education, admissions, and social equity.

The Future We're Building

Imagine a world powered by everyone's full potential.

That's what we're building at Acuity Insights.

Our company was founded on the need for a higher education admissions method that looks beyond academic performance and considers the whole student—their unique qualities, experiences, and strengths.

Today, our solutions help discover, nurture and realize people's potential, supporting holistic success from admissions to graduation for students, education programs, and higher education institutions across North America, the U.K., Australia, and the Gulf.

Our core assessment product, Casper, provides education programs with a more holistic view of applicants by evaluating their soft skills. Incorporating Casper's insights into the admissions process results in a larger applicant pool, enables student success, and graduates better professionals.
