Imagine yourself building the next breakthrough AI/Machine-Learning technology, enabling ""AI for everyone"" at the start of the company's explosive growth.

Super.AI is used by global enterprises across all industries, from banks, logistics, and insurance companies to Testing, Inspection, and certification (TIC) or retail companies. Super.AI has created the world’s most advanced AI automation platform to extract data from any document with guaranteed quality. We enable companies to leverage the latest AI models, including. LLMs, and super.AI Data Processing Crowd for human-in-the-loop (HITL) review to automate business processes end-to-end with guaranteed results.

Your profile

What You'll Do


Measure and ensure the high-quality output of AI workloads for our enterprise customers.
Deploy and manage production workloads for a global customer base.
Write, rewrite, and extend Python code, and deploy it to containers (e.g., Docker).
Conduct local testing using tools like Jupyter Notebook.
Integrate AI cloud solutions and adapt them to our large-scale use cases.
Perform prompt engineering for customer use cases.
Fine-tune and deploy Large Language Models (LLMs).
Develop software that scales to meet the demands of high-load customer workloads.


What We Are Looking For


Smart, humble, hardworking, and collaborative
By smart we don't necessarily mean high IQ (although a huge plus), but an affinity toward learning. We want to automate as much as possible so we can focus on the few things that require human intelligence and creativity.
By humble we don't mean submissive or unambitious, we mean it in the same way Roger Federer is humble.
By hardworking, we don't mean long hours (be with your family). What we mean is while you're here you're doing the best work of your life. It means being disciplined, professional, focused, gritty, resilient, and resourceful.
By collaborative, we don't mean submissive or deferential, it means taking leadership from everywhere. ""I'm taking responsibility to fix this system"", if there's a lack of trust ""I'm going to address it"" if goals are unclear ""I'm going to deal with it"", it's about being a meritocracy
All four of the above are required. We all know people missing one of these and it's not nice to work with them (e.g. someone who is smart and hardworking but not humble and collaborative).
Paradoxical
The people we like the most are smart but humble
Wants to win no matter what, but will not cross lines of integrity to get there
Strong beliefs weakly held, etc.

Your Experience


3-5 years of professional experience in software development.
Proven ability to work backwards from customer needs to deliver AI-based features that meet those needs.
Ability to organize and prioritize competing workloads.
Familiarity with distributed systems and cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
Solid understanding of machine learning principles.
Experience with container frameworks such as Docker or Kubernetes.
Proficiency in using REST APIs.


If this resonates with you, it would be amazing to get to know each other.

Why us?

At super.AI our mission is to make AI accessible to all and use AI to enrich the human experience and make the world a better place. We are a group of smart, creative people who have come together from MIT, Microsoft Research, AWS, Google, and Apple to work toward that mission. As a first step towards that goal, we have built an AI platform to help businesses make sense of unstructured data. Our culture is collaborative and fun that puts customers first.

About Us


We believe AI is going to be the most impactful technology ever invented. It may be the last technology we ever needed to invent as humans. We don’t want it to be in the hands of the few, but the hands of the many. Our technology promises to transform the way AI is created and consumed to make this vision possible.
We are searching for the best-of-the-best to build a massive company, but at the same time a company where people are happy with their lives, feel healthy, passionate and satisfied.
We're at an inflection point, so you will have the opportunity to shape things and see the company grow
Although super.AI is young, this is not our first rodeo: our CEO previously founded a few hundred person company, and between us we've held senior positions at Google, Amazon, Adobe, Microsoft, Docusign and others

Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.

About Merchant Group at Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business. Their core mission is to provide merchants with self-service tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use.

About The Merchant Analytics Team

Merchant Analytics is an embedded analytics function within the Merchant Group. The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4-5+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

🎄Please note that we might have delays due to the festive season.

We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Healthcare workers speak freely and our AI automatically generates the correct structured forms.

We are YC-funded and grow quickly. Our customers like Caritas, Contilia, and TÜV NORD create thousands of documentation records every single day.

Today speech recognition is primarily used as a “fun” gimmick for consumers, who set kitchen timers with their Alexa speaker. We build a completely new class of speech-powered applications, to supercharge the professional workforce. By focusing on individual workflows like healthcare or vehicle inspections, we create truly magical user experiences and save each user 30 minutes per day in administrative work. Don’t believe it? See for yourself in our 3-minute product demo (https://youtu.be/AlkVD4OwCQk).

The entire system is built in-house, giving us full control over the user experience, product design, NLP models, and speech recognition. Our custom speech recognition models already outperform Google with 10x lower error rates and we are just getting started!

If you ever wanted to work at the bleeding edge of product design, applied machine learning research, and MLOps, you should apply. You get to build products with daily user feedback, train AI models on real-world data, and ship to production on a daily basis.

At voize new software is deployed to production every 5h on average! We deploy new AI models every 24h and have one of the largest speech data sets for medical documentation.

Tasks

We’re looking for team members who enjoy talking to customers, iterating & shipping quickly.

As an ML developer, you will take core responsibility for the design, training, evaluation, and deployment of our deep learning models in the space of speech recognition and NLP. The models you will build and work on are at the heart of our applications and are directly impacting the end-user. You get to engineer large self-supervised trainings as well as fast inference for mobile devices and hosted environments.

Requirements

You should be comfortable with the following tech stack


Python
Deep Learning Frameworks (preferably PyTorch)
Speech recognition or NLP & Transformer models
Typical Software Engineering skills like Git, Docker, etc
Bonus: Kotlin, React Native / Typescript



Team Work & Personal Skills:


You have to be able to work in a team, communicate clearly, take ownership over your work and share feedback with your teammates.
You need to feel empathy for the user and have a deep passion for great product experiences. You will talk to users, listen to their feedback, understand their daily challenges, and translate those insights into product decisions.
You need great time management skills and be self-sufficient. Your colleges have to be able to rely on you.



Language & Region


You need to be able to speak German fluently. (especially to talk to customers)
You need to live in Germany and be legally allowed to work in Germany.



Benefits


voize is based in Berlin and has a remote-friendly workplace.
We offer flexible work hours and believe that you know best when you want to work
We have an open culture and regular team events
As a fast-growing startup, there are new challenges daily and plenty of learning opportunities for your personal development
Own part of the company through stock option packages



Interview Process

To help us determine that we are both a great fit for each other and are happy to change the world together for years to come, we run a 4 stage interview process. This process is usually completed in 2-3 weeks.


First Call with the founder (Remote):



This is a more informal video call with you and one of our founders, to get to know you, and share more details on the role. Together we want to determine if this role is a great fit for you and get a basic understanding of your personal interests and technical & soft skills.


Technical Interview with CTO (Remote):



In this video call, we want to learn more about your technical skills and past projects you have worked on.

The best way to impress us is by showing us a project you’ve built and walking us through the 2 hardest technical/design decisions you had to make.

Mostly, we want to know that you can code and ship fairly involved systems, and speak to them with clarity on the details. This tends to be a good indication that an engineer had strong ownership and showed autonomy in making a product or technical decisions.


Pair Programming Challenge (Remote):



At this stage, we want to show you the kind of challenges we are facing on a daily basis. In a pair programming setting, you will get access to a portion of our system and will debug an Error we’ve introduced or build a prototype of a new feature.


Onboarding



If you and our team both see a great culture and technical fit, we will send you a job offer and walk you through our onboarding process.

In your first week, you will ship your very own first feature to production! We will prepare a great first task, help you along the way and celebrate the release and direct user feedback.

JustWatch delivers data-driven digital marketing for the global entertainment business. From the biggest blockbusters to award-winning shows, major sporting events, and best-selling console games. Not only are we entertainment obsessives ourselves, but we also own the world's largest streaming guide, which gives us unparalleled data and insights on audience behaviors and content tastes.




From a small startup, we've evolved into a 200+ strong team, based in Berlin, around the world, or working remotely. We've been all about building a profitable business while riding that wave of impressive growth.




Who we need

Are you tired of academia?
Do you get more satisfaction from delivering business results and great questions instead of producing research papers?
Are you building a deep intuition about data and how to define success before going deep with algorithms?




If you're a builder who is fearless in challenging conventions and bringing new ideas to the table to bring our tailor-made tools for the needs of the movie industry to the very next level, we want to hear from you!




What you will be doing

Own the machine room of the data products driving our business. Given a proper understanding of our business model, what would you like to do?
Improve our automated campaign steering and drive home every flight on target and on time.
Work on our mean hybrid interest signals data machine.
Collaborate directly with the founders of JustWatch on the business brain of our company and lead your team to deliver on time.
And advance our targeting by extracting every ounce of entertainment intelligence from our recommendation system based on massive user and item data.
Don't start from scratch. Draw from years of data engineering excellence and a treasure trove of meaningful quality data you can model on from day one. Iterate with boring technology and keep it simple. Snowflake, Python, Pytorch, Scipy, XGBoost. You'll start introducing more complexity where it makes sense.
Build prototypes based on smart assumptions in three days instead of planning to outperform the SoTA in three months.
Understand our rich internal Recommendations-ML-Engine to pull from. Work on classical (non-)linear optimization problems through tabular modeling, forecasting, normalization, and NLP.
Steal liberally from basic research instead of attempting it yourself.




What we need from you

You are an expert in machine learning and data science, but you see yourself more as a solutions engineer than a scientist.
An executionist mentality- someone who is less academic more of a renegade.
You get satisfaction from delivering business results and asking great questions rather than from producing research papers.
A system thinker who intuitively understands data and defines success well before diving into algorithms.
Constant learning, delivering results, and creating value are the core characteristics of everyone at JustWatch and we are looking for these values in every person we hire.




What we offer you

An open-minded and international team that loves to collaborate to reach our goals.
We believe in a permission-less environment that lets us focus on delivering value without overcomplicating things.
We prioritize meaningful work over perks and that true fulfillment comes from intrinsic motivation, personal growth, and making a lasting impact.
We trust our skilled professionals to maintain a no-nonsense attitude and create an environment that promotes innovation.
We are committed to helping you achieve your personal and professional goals, and we offer a collaborative and supportive environment to do so.
Truly a hybrid work environment. You are not required to come to the office, but you will want to.




While a solid technical background is crucial, we are looking for someone who is not just a scientist or nerd but also can think strategically and work effectively with different stakeholders in JustWatch. If you have the personality, skills, and experience we are looking for, and if you are genuinely excited about the opportunity to drive business growth through machine learning and data science, we want to hear from you!




Media is important to us and we are always happy to hear from people who enjoy film! If you feel like you are missing some of the hard skills – don’t worry, we are hiring for the attitude, values, and personality.




If we caught your attention and you're eager to delve into our perspectives and thought processes, we recommend immersing yourself in our blog post, which elaborates on these subjects:




A company culture that really works
Audience as a Service

At Doctolib, we're on a mission to transform the way healthcare is delivered by leveraging the power of AI. You can play a key role in developing and implementing cutting-edge AI models that power our AI phone assistant for medical practices. The phone assistant allows patients to make, reschedule, or cancel appointments via phone without long hold times, providing more flexibility and around-the-clock access to healthcare services. It addresses a significant challenge in the healthcare sector: managing the high volume of telephone calls in order to improve the efficiency of healthcare professionals in their daily tasks.

As a Senior Data Scientist, you will enhance Doctolib’s phone assistant by improving speech-to-text accuracy through fine-tuning while ensuring low latency. You will also develop a conversational flow based on intent classification, information extraction (potentially using LLMs, Agentic Framework or traditional ML techniques) and internal API calls. You will improve user experience by adapting to users’ emotions in real time and reducing dropout rates by making the conversation feel ever more smooth, seamless and natural. You will also ensure safety by implementing guardrails that catch prediction errors before they happen, or mitigate their impact. The phone assistant will be the playground where you can do your best work and stay at the edge of innovation.

Your responsibilities include, but are not limited to:


Creating, finding or adapting model architecture.
Designing the right annotation and data collection strategy
Implementing and putting new ideas to the test to improve model performance and ultimately user experience.

Job Description

Strategy, Planning and Budget

Strategy, Planning and Budget operates at the heart of the Treasury to develop the Department’s overall strategy and business plan, assess performance and risk, and help deliver its objectives with a large, flexible project team who work on ministerial priorities across the whole range of the department’s policy responsibilities. We also co-ordinate the Chancellor’s annual Budget, the Finance Bill and the Treasury’s tax strategy, as well as coordinate the Treasury’s responses to the COVID-19 Public Inquiry and provide support to ministers and officials who are Inquiry witnesses. SPB also promotes excellent policymaking across the department and houses the Darlington Leadership Team, which works to ensure the successful delivery of the Darlington Economic Campus (DEC).

About The Team

The Growth Delivery Unit (GDU) is a new team established to drive delivery of the Chancellor’s priorities and support her leadership of the growth mission – the government’s ambition to grow the UK economy. We do that by combining policy, analytical, project management and data science skills to monitor the progress of policies and projects from announcement to actually delivering real-world outcomes; identify when and why progress is being blocked; and intervene to overcome those barriers. This role is part of our recruitment to put the GDU on a permanent footing across both our London and Darlington offices.

We are a friendly team with a can-do attitude. Our work can be fast paced but we work flexibly to support each other. We offer lots of development support to help you thrive. Diversity and team wellbeing are very important to us. Our work is relatable and interesting because it is focused on priority issues which are often in the news and have tangible impacts.

About The Job

This is a new role, working directly on a priority of the Chancellor and her team, shaping work on the Growth Mission.

As data scientist, you will be instrumental in the success of priority growth programmes. You will shape the journey of this data from source to use by system leaders, exercising significant range in the techniques you choose to deploy. You will help implement data engineering solutions, understanding a range of architectures (including using the cloud) and data transformation tools.

You will help collect data, conduct high quality analysis, create engaging visualisations and develop insights, all to inform critical decision making by the Chancellor, HMT ministers, and Civil Service Leaders. You will identify opportunities to add statistical insight, and use a variety of data analytics techniques (such as data mining and prescriptive and predictive analytics) for complex data analysis through the whole data life cycle.

You will also contribute to the cross-government data science community, engaging with a range of stakeholders to champion the value of data science. GDU aims to be a centre of excellence within HMT applying cutting edge technologies to policy and delivery problems, drawing on capabilities in Python and cloud computing.

Key Responsibilities


Support the Range E and E2 analytical team in developing and maintaining innovative, clear, and engaging analytical products. Use Python and tools like Plotly Dash to create insights and interactive dashboards that effectively communicate delivery progress on priority projects.
Applying data science and other analytical techniques to extract delivery-relevant insight from data and communicating those insights in a clear and engaging manner for senior decision makers.
Maintain and build data flows and pipelines from a wide range of sources across Whitehall by establishing relationships and promoting technological solutions such as APIs. Maintenance of said pipelines in Microsoft Azure.
Excellent communication skills, and ability to build and maintaining relationships across HMT. Build and maintain strong relationships with analytical teams in No10, CO and across government to ensure Ministers are presented with a single source of truth.
