Hos Fellowmind søger vi en Data Scientist, der kan forvandle data til værdifulde indsigter og hjælpe os med at forudsige morgendagens udfordringer og muligheder inden for den grønne omstilling, øget elektrificering og kapacitet.

Din rolle i Energy & Utility teamet

Som Data Scientist hos os bliver du en del af et innovativt og ambitiøst team, der arbejder målrettet med at skabe datadrevne og intelligente løsninger til branchen. Din opgave bliver at konsolidere og modellere store mængder data og identificere mønstre og sammenhænge, som kan hjælpe os og vores kunder med at træffe bedre beslutninger om net-planlægning og -udbygning samt identificere uregelmæssigheder og fejl før de opstår.

Du vil arbejde med store mængder data og derudfra bygge avancerede modeller, der kan forudsige kapacitetsudfordringer og besvare spørgsmål som: Hvor vil der opstå behov for nye ladestandere? Hvordan påvirker hele boligområders overgang til elbiler vores elnet? Og hvordan kan vi bedst planlægge udbygning og vedligeholdelse af infrastrukturen baseret på historiske data og fremtidige prognoser?

Dine ansvarsområder:


Udførende i at skabe værdifulde indsigter fra data, også med udvikling af AI/ML-funktioner til datadrevne og intelligente løsninger.
Udvikle og implementere modeller til at forudsige fremtidige energibehov baseret på data fra de seneste år, på forskellige områder.
Muliggøre analyse af eksempelvis belastningen på elnettet og danne grundlag for løsninger til at imødekomme kapacitetsudfordringer.
Identificere og genkende mønstre i komplekse datasæt for at skabe operationelle anbefalinger.
Arbejde med scenarieanalyse og ""what-if""-problemstillinger
Skabe grundlag for indsigt og forudsigelser, der hjælper vores kunder med at navigere i deres investeringer i fremtidens energiløsninger.



Hvem er du?

Vi forestiller os, at du har en stærk baggrund inden for dataanalyse og modellering. Du har måske en uddannelse i fysik, matematik eller data engineering, data science og forstår komplekse energidomæner. Du er god til at arbejde med data og kan hurtigt lære nye teknologier og værktøjer. Hvis du har erfaring med at arbejde med store datasæt og interesse for energisektoren er det et stort plus.

Du er skarp i kommunikation og formår at formidle komplekse ""findings"" i et letforståeligt sprog.

Rent teknisk forestiller vi os at du har flere af følgende egenskaber:


Er knivskarp til SQL og forstår relationelle data helt ud til fingerspidserne.
Praktisk erfaring med Machine Learning og udvikling af funktionelle AI/ML løsninger.
Praktisk erfaring med MLOPs (Machine Learning Operations).
Har erfaring med Databricks, Data Factory og Data Lake eller tilsvarende teknologier.
DevOps-processer/pipelines og relaterede cloudtjenester/teknologier til udrulning af ML-løsninger.



Om din kommende arbejdsplads:

Fellowmind er et landsdækkende og førende IT-konsulenthus og samtidig landets mest prisvindende Microsoft-partner med mere en 15 års branche fokus på energi- og forsyning. Med dybe spidskompetencer og målrettede løsninger er vi aktiv medspiller i at drive den grønne omstilling ved hjælp af data. Som ny kollega i Fellowmind vil du møde en organisation, der ikke kun tillader, men tilskynder personlig og faglig udvikling, hvorfor selve arbejdsmiljøet også i høj grad bærer præg af tillid, nysgerrighed og respekt alle kollegaer imellem.

Vi tror på at arbejdsglæde og trivsel er fundamentet for både glade kollegaer og høj kundetilfredshed. Vi tilbyder derfor bl.a. en fleksibel arbejdsplads, hvor du har friheden til at tilpasse din arbejdstid efter dine behov. Vi har stor tillid til, at du selv kender de rammer, der får dig til at trives. Vi synes dog selv, at det er vigtigst at fremhæve, at du får et stærkt team, der støtter dig hele vejen, og du kommer til at indgå i en fed virksomheds kultur.

Såfremt du har nogle spørgsmål til stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte vores Rekrutteringskonsulent, Mathias på +45 2332 4290.

This is a newly established role, created as part of our ambition to elevate our performance management capability to the next level!

In this role, you will collaborate with teams across the organisation to turn data into actionable insights, ensuring that our processes are optimised and consistent and aligned with business goals. Your key responsibilities include:

At the same time, you have the curiosity and creativity to think outside the box and find innovative solutions.
We expect you to have several years of experience with R, VBA, robotics or similar, and the ability to leverage these technologies to drive automations.
You are proactive, motivated to push things forward and you enjoy working at the intersection of data, technology and business optimisation.

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.




To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.




For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.




We’re seeking exceptional engineers with a passion for backend, data, infrastructure, mobile, or security & privacy. While we'll consider your preferences, our engineers are encouraged to move across different areas of the company, and everyone holds the title of software engineer.




No matter your seniority, you will work on production code, directly improving our products or adding new exceptional features. At the moment, most teams use Python, Typescript, or Java for the backend, and Kotlin and Swift for mobile. Our approach to software development is highly flexible, and we adapt our tech stack to the needs of the different products.




Please note that our internships (both full- and part-time) require a minimum commitment of 6 months.




A few examples of your responsibilities:

Work closely with other software engineers to expand our set of libraries and make our processes ever-more efficient.
Learn about the latest and greatest technologies, testing the promising ones to make sure we don’t miss out on game-changing opportunities to boost our productivity and potential for impact.
Constantly improve the quality of our products, tools, or infrastructures by fixing bugs and refactoring the code base where necessary.




What we look for

Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.
You can work at least 20 hours per week. A full-time commitment is preferred, but we’ll consider applicants who can commit to at least 20 hours per week.




What we offer

Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of €63,965. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between €105,737 and €143,330. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.




Commitment & contract

Internship. Part-time or Full-time.




Location

Milan (Italy) or fully remote.




Before you apply

Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We’re extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don’t hesitate to apply.




The selection process

If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.




Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested at accommodations-ext@bendingspoons.com.




Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

At the Bank of England, we want all colleagues to feel valued and respected, so we're working hard to build an inclusive culture which supports people from all backgrounds and communities to be at their best at work.

ecobee introduced the world’s first smart Wi-Fi thermostat to help millions of consumers save money, conserve energy, and bring home automation into their lives. That was just the beginning. We continue our pursuit to create technology that brings peace of mind into the home and allows people to focus on the moments that matter most. We take pride in making a meaningful difference to the environment, all while being part of the exciting, connected home revolution.

In 2021, ecobee became a subsidiary of Generac Power Systems. Generac introduced the first affordable backup generator and later created the category of automatic home standby generator. The company is committed to sustainable, cleaner energy products poised to revolutionize the 21st century electrical grid. Together, we take pride in making a meaningful difference to the environment.

Why we love to do what we do:

We’re helping build the world of tomorrow with solutions that improve everyday life while making a positive impact on the planet. Our products and services work in harmony to provide comfort, efficiency, and peace of mind for millions of homes and businesses. While we’re proud of what we’ve done so far, there’s still a lot we can do—and you can be part of it.

Join our extraordinary team.

We're a rapidly growing global tech company headquartered in Canada, in the heart of downtown Toronto, with a satellite office in Leeds, UK (and remote ecopeeps in the US). We get to work with some of North America and UK's leading professionals. Our colleagues are proud to bring their authentic selves to work, confident that what we do is grounded in a greater purpose. We’re always looking for curious, talented, and passionate people to join our team.

Who you'll be joining:

The ecobee Smart Security service, launched in 2020 to rave reviews, is the intelligent solution that protects home and families.  Our system uses machine learning and advanced sensor technology to protect our customers most precious asset – their home.  This is just the beginning!  We’re embarking on a journey to combine our Energy and Security products to create industry leading, world class features to create safer and greener homes. Join us to help make ecobee the best eco-friendly smart security product on the planet.

Working as part of our Smart Security Camera team, you’ll play a pivotal role within our UK-based engineering function, both delivering knockout features and maintaining existing systems and platforms. You’ll be working across a large part of the Camera tech stack, from cloud services written primarily in Python to on-device code implemented in Golang (although it’d be great if you had experience here, we’re also welcome to hearing from candidates who are eager to learn on the job). Some of the highlights of things you’ll be involved with include building cutting-edge AI-driven algorithms for object detection and designing power-optimized algorithms for our next-gen devices.

The engineering teams believe strongly in operational excellence – taking ownership of the services and systems they build right through to production. From monitoring, troubleshooting and optimizing the services running in GCP to analysing real-time fleet metrics from tens of thousands of real-world home security devices.

As part of a large, globally distributed engineering function you’ll have regular opportunity to interface with teams working on other parts of the ecobee product range – from subscription services to energy products and mobile apps.

You’ll benefit from regular learning days (with lots of smart people around to inspire your upskilling choices!), a dedicated learning and development budget, an annual (optional) trip to Toronto for our TechConnect conference, as well as other opportunities for growth and development! 

Technologies we use:   


Golang, Python
Apollo GraphQL   
GitHub Actions (CI/CD), CircleCI   
Google Cloud, GKE, CloudSQL, PubSub, Cloud Run, DataStore, BigQuery, Dataflow, etc.  
Terraform


How you’ll make an impact:


Deliver robust software as cloud services in GCP and on distributed IoT devices
Work with best practice – help keep our engineering standard high
Helpmentor more junior engineers, supporting their journey to becoming superstar individual contributors
Contribute to key architectural design decisions for our next generation devices


What you bring to the table:

We've built the below list as a guideline for some of the skills and interests of our development team - but we strive to build our team with members from a diverse background and skill set, so if any combination of these apply to you, we'd love to chat! 


Familiarity with crafting production code in object-oriented Python. Experience in Golang would be nice, or a strong desire to learn it on the job
Excellent ability to balance technical excellence with getting stuff done – you’re not fazed by pressure to deliver and know when and where tradeoffs should be made (and when they shouldn’t)
A great team player and proactive communicator – being part of a large engineering function, you’ll regularly be working with peers in other teams
Strong experience with GCP, AWS or Azure
You enjoy finding better and faster way to solve complex problems, even if it means challenging the status quo
You love to be challenged and are fearless in diving into issues with a high degree of uncertainty attached in areas such as scale, redundancy, performance optimisation and concurrency
Embrace running a production environment as well as building it. You’ll be responsible for getting your code live and monitoring the services that you (and others) have created, responding to incidents, and generally making sure the team builds software that is robust, resilient and observable


Just so you know: The hired candidate will be required to complete a background check

What happens after you apply:

Application review: It will happen. By an actual person in Talent Acquisition. As we sometimes get upwards of 100+ applications for some roles, it can take a few days, but every applicant can expect a note regarding their application status.

Interview Process:


Round 1: A 30-minute phone call with a member of Talent Acquisition
Round 2: A 45-minute virtual interview with the Hiring Manager and a member of the team
Round 3: A 90-minute technical deep dive interview with the team (2 engineers) on a take home task we'll provide 1 week in advance of your interview


With ecobee, you’ll have the opportunity to:


Be part of something big: Get to work in a fresh, dynamic, and ever-growing industry.
Make a difference for the environment: Make a sustainable impact while on your daily job, and after it through programs like ecobee acts.
Expand your career: Learn with our in-house learning enablement team, and enjoy our generous professional learning budget.
Put people first: Benefit from competitive salaries, health benefits, and a progressive Parental Top-Up Program (75% top-up or five bonus days off).
Play a part on an exceptional culture: Enjoy a fun and casual workplace with an open concept office, located at Queens Quay W & York St. ecobee Leeds is based at our riverside office on the Calls.
Celebrate diversity: Be part of a truly welcoming workplace. We offer a mentorship program and bias training.


Are you interested? Let's make it work.

The Data and Analytics Transformation Directorate (DAT) helps the Bank make the best use of data and analytics to fulfil its mission. Almost everything the Bank does depends on data and our ability to use it effectively. The Bank is prioritising investment to modernise how we manage our data and carry out our analytical processes. DAT comprises four divisions: Advanced Analytics Division; Data Strategy and Implementation Division; Data Transformation Programmes Division; and the Data and Statistics Division.

The Data and Statistics Division (DSD) is the Bank's centre of expertise for the collection, compilation, dissemination, and publication of regulatory and statistical data. As part of this, DSD encourages innovation and promotes quality to support analysis, and policy' and decision-making by the Bank's various committees, as well as UK government departments and international organisations.

DSD collects data from banks and buildings societies, credit unions, insurance companies, regulated mortgage lenders and mortgage administrators. This is done via nearly 40 statistical collections and over 200 regulatory collections. We cleanse a sizeable proportion of these datasets and publish a large volume of statistical data via our interactive database. We support the Bank's policy committees and the Prudential Regulation Authority Board. Our data are used in a number of publications, such as the Inflation Report, Financial Stability Report, Credit Conditions Review, Stress Test Results, FPC Core Indicators, and Quarterly Bulletins. This role sits in the Industrial Team of the Money and Credit Group (MCG).

Job description

The Research Assistant role will support the Team within MCG to ensure the quality and timeliness of data related to deposits from and lending to UK businesses and households. This is an operational role where you will manually investigate unusual data points to check possible data quality issues and communicate with reporting institutions to fix them by acting as a key point of contact. You will also ensure business processes run timely and liaise with internal support areas when issues arise. This will entail building a network of contacts within DSD and beyond, and effective stakeholder management, as you will need to find solutions while keeping stakeholders, including senior managers informed of progress. Additionally, you'll play a key role in implementing lessons learned across the Research Assistant team.

MCG's role as centre of expertise means you should be able to interpret, understand, and provide context for emerging stories in our data. A wider interest in broader macroeconomic themes, a keenness to analyse large data series, and the ability to observe and link patterns across data sets will be useful here.

Alongside the core data assurance element, this role also offers the opportunity to undertake a range of projects. These include (but are not limited to): implementing process improvements - which may call on basic coding and data manipulation skills; undertaking broader analytical pieces of work to understand stories that have emerged from our data sets; and carrying out analyses into the data sets we are responsible for to help further our understanding of any potentially anomalous reporting.

Role Requirements

Minimum (Essential) Criteria


You have proven professional experience in a context that requires being organised and managing deadlines with competing priorities.
Demonstrate good interpersonal skills and an ability to build networks and work as part of a team.
Demonstrated ability to work autonomously and to self-direct learning.
Demonstrate strong numerical skills and an ability to investigate and draw stories from datasets.
Demonstrate proficiency manipulating data using Excel and R or Python (or demonstrate evidence of being in the process of learning).
Interest in understanding broader economic developments and how they translate into statistical reporting.


Desirable Criteria

Ability to use programming techniques using R or Python to automate and improve data workflow processes.
A keen interest to explain developments in the data by applying macroeconomic principles.
Our Approach to Inclusion
The Bank values diversity, equity and inclusion. We play a key role in maintaining monetary and financial stability, and to do that effectively, we believe we need a workforce that reflects the society we serve.


At the Bank of England, we want all colleagues to feel valued and respected, so we're working hard to build an inclusive culture which supports people from all backgrounds and communities to be at their best at work. We celebrate all forms of diversity, including (but not limited to) age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, race, religion, sexual orientation and socioeconomic status.

          <p><strong>Data and Analytics Transformation </strong></p><p>The Data and Analytics Transformation Directorate (DAT) helps the Bank make the best use of data and analytics to fulfil its mission. Almost everything the Bank does depends on data and our ability to use it effectively. The Bank is prioritising investment to modernise how we manage our data and carry out our analytical processes. DAT comprises four divisions: Advanced Analytics Division; Data Strategy and Implementation Division; Data Transformation Programmes Division; and the Data and Statistics Division.</p><p>The Data and Statistics Division (DSD) is the Bank's centre of expertise for the collection, compilation, dissemination, and publication of regulatory and statistical data. As part of this, DSD encourages innovation and promotes quality to support analysis, and policy' and decision-making by the Bank's various committees, as well as UK government departments and international organisations.</p><p>DSD collects data from banks and buildings societies, credit unions, insurance companies, regulated mortgage lenders and mortgage administrators. This is done via nearly 40 statistical collections and over 200 regulatory collections. We cleanse a sizeable proportion of these datasets and publish a large volume of statistical data via our interactive database. We support the Bank's policy committees and the Prudential Regulation Authority Board. Our data are used in a number of publications, such as the Inflation Report, Financial Stability Report, Credit Conditions Review, Stress Test Results, FPC Core Indicators, and Quarterly Bulletins. This role sits in the Industrial Team of the Money and Credit Group (MCG). </p><p><strong>Job description</strong></p><p>The Research Assistant role will support the Team within MCG to ensure the quality and timeliness of data related to deposits from and lending to UK businesses and households. This is an operational role where you will manually investigate unusual data points to check possible data quality issues and communicate with reporting institutions to fix them by acting as a key point of contact. You will also ensure business processes run timely and liaise with internal support areas when issues arise. This will entail building a network of contacts within DSD and beyond, and effective stakeholder management, as you will need to find solutions while keeping stakeholders, including senior managers informed of progress. Additionally, you'll play a key role in implementing lessons learned across the Research Assistant team. </p><p>MCG's role as centre of expertise means you should be able to interpret, understand, and provide context for emerging stories in our data. A wider interest in broader macroeconomic themes, a keenness to analyse large data series, and the ability to observe and link patterns across data sets will be useful here. </p><p>Alongside the core data assurance element, this role also offers the opportunity to undertake a range of projects. These include (but are not limited to): implementing process improvements - which may call on basic coding and data manipulation skills; undertaking broader analytical pieces of work to understand stories that have emerged from our data sets; and carrying out analyses into the data sets we are responsible for to help further our understanding of any potentially anomalous reporting. </p><p><strong>Role Requirements<br><br></strong><strong>Minimum (Essential) Criteria<br></strong> </p><ul><li>You have proven professional experience in a context that requires being organised and managing deadlines with competing priorities. </li><li>Demonstrate good interpersonal skills and an ability to build networks and work as part of a team.</li><li>Demonstrated ability to work autonomously and to self-direct learning.</li><li>Demonstrate strong numerical skills and an ability to investigate and draw stories from datasets.</li><li>Demonstrate proficiency manipulating data using Excel and R or Python (or demonstrate evidence of being in the process of learning). </li><li>Interest in understanding broader economic developments and how they translate into statistical reporting.</li></ul><p><br><strong>Desirable Criteria</strong></p><ul><li>Ability to use programming techniques using R or Python to automate and improve data workflow processes. </li><li>A keen interest to explain developments in the data by applying macroeconomic principles. </li></ul><strong>Our Approach to Inclusion<br></strong>The Bank values diversity, equity and inclusion. We play a key role in maintaining monetary and financial stability, and to do that effectively, we believe we need a workforce that reflects the society we serve. <br><br> <br>At the Bank of England, we want all colleagues to feel valued and respected, so we're working hard to build an inclusive culture which supports people from all backgrounds and communities to be at their best at work.
