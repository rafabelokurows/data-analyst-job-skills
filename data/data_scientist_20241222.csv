SPB also promotes excellent policymaking across the department and houses the Darlington Leadership Team, which works to ensure the successful delivery of the Darlington Economic Campus (DEC).

About The Team

The Growth Delivery Unit (GDU) is a new team established to drive delivery of the Chancellor‚Äôs priorities and support her leadership of the growth mission ‚Äì the government‚Äôs ambition to grow the UK economy. We do that by combining policy, analytical, project management and data science skills to monitor the progress of policies and projects from announcement to actually delivering real-world outcomes; identify when and why progress is being blocked; and intervene to overcome those barriers. This role is part of our recruitment to put the GDU on a permanent footing across both our London and Darlington offices.

We are a friendly team with a can-do attitude. Our work can be fast paced but we work flexibly to support each other. We offer lots of development support to help you thrive.

You will help collect data, conduct high quality analysis, create engaging visualisations and develop insights, all to inform critical decision making by the Chancellor, HMT ministers, and Civil Service Leaders. You will identify opportunities to add statistical insight, and use a variety of data analytics techniques (such as data mining and prescriptive and predictive analytics) for complex data analysis through the whole data life cycle.

You will also contribute to the cross-government data science community, engaging with a range of stakeholders to champion the value of data science. GDU aims to be a centre of excellence within HMT applying cutting edge technologies to policy and delivery problems, drawing on capabilities in Python and cloud computing.

We are here to win - not just to take part. Just like our clients who operate at the elite level of sport, we understand that in order to win; we need to put in the work. This means going the extra mile, being willing to do what others will not and holding ourselves to a higher standard. Some companies play to not lose, we play to win. We are proactive, decisive and have the courage to take risks.

We pay it forward - we are always helpful. To customers, to partners and most importantly to each other. Not because it will ‚Äòpay back', because it's the right thing to do.

We are adaptable - we understand in a world that is changing faster than ever before - the only constant is change. The average lifespan of a Fortune 100 company in 1958 was 61 years, now it is 18 years. We adapt to a changing world, constantly iterating, moving forward and staying relevant.

Impossible is an opinion - we are on a mission to build something which has never been done before from the ground up. It will be a hard journey full of challenges which are currently unsolved. Our culture is defined by the fact that when we are confronted with challenges, we work from the assumption that it is possible to overcome them.

We always trust, respect and care for each other - it's no easy feat working in a startup, let alone one with goals as ambitious as ours. At sequel we believe no one is ever too busy to support fellow team members and that we should always be helpful, inclusive and selfless in the way we work. Diversity of background and thought is celebrated as we respect and appreciate what makes us all different. We don't tolerate free riders, egos or workplace politics.

Centre for Net Zero üåé ‚Äì Data /

Fixed Term Contract /

Hybrid



Centre for Net Zero (CNZ) is a not-for-profit, impact-driven energy research institute, founded by the Octopus Energy Group. Operating autonomously, our goal is to accelerate the journey to a fully sustainable, global energy system ‚ôªÔ∏è üåé

While technology is transforming the energy sector, both modelling and policymaking are typically based on data from the past. By contrast, CNZ can access unprecedented insight into future human behaviours by leveraging Octopus Energy‚Äôs global customer base. We design and run research and field trials around the world to generate and democratise data about the future energy system.

We are seeking an Economist/Data Scientist to join our Trials and Analysis team at the Centre for Net Zero (CNZ) for an 18-month fixed-term contract. CNZ operates a hybrid working arrangement, where most colleagues come to the office 2-3 times per week.

The Trials and Analysis team leads the design and delivery of field trials and quasi-experimental analyses, in collaboration with a range of delivery partners ‚Äì including companies within the Octopus Energy Group, including Octopus Energy Limited, the largest electricity supplier in the UK, Octopus Electric Vehicles, Octopus Electroverse, and Octopus Energy Group companies supplying energy to consumers in France, Spain, Italy, Japan, Texas, and other markets; as well as external partners such as National Energy System Operator and OVO Energy.

The main responsibilities of this role are the design and analysis of various randomised control trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental analyses related to low carbon technology adoption, automation, energy flexibility, and the intersection of these topics. In turn, our vision is that this research shapes policy for the better.

What You'll Do


Trial design: Designing field trials and drafting pre-analysis plans, often in close collaboration with delivery partners within and outside Octopus Energy Group ‚Äì this requires a pragmatic approach given the commercial sensitivity of the data we work with and the interventions we evaluate.
Implementation: Working closely with a project manager on our team to help the delivery partner(s) deliver the trial in a way that maintains fidelity to the pre-analysis plan and enables rigorous analysis once complete.
Data analysis: Carrying out data analyses of our field trials as well as conducting quasi-experimental analyses, structuring these analyses to turn them into high quality reporting.
Reporting: Contributing to and leading the write-up of these analyses into academic papers and accessible, policy-facing materials. At CNZ, this phase of a project is especially collaborative, involving one or more rounds of feedback from other members of CNZ.
Partner engagement: Liaising with partners, managing and coordinating implementation across partners, and communicating updates to key partners and external stakeholders.



Our reporting generally takes two main forms: 1) academic journal articles, and 2) accessible, policy-facing materials.


We will generally assign an individual data scientist to lead on specific trials and quasi-experimental analyses. You will work closely with the Director of the Trials and Analysis team, as well as our Chief Economist, in the writing of academic journal articles based on the trial or quasi-experimental analysis. Here are examples of this output for the impact of heat pumps on energy demand and the impact of the demand flexibility service on energy demand. We also do smaller pieces of analysis for blogposts or white papers for policymakers.
To create the policy-facing materials, the Trials and Analysis team then works closely with CNZ‚Äôs external affairs and communications team to package our analyses into high-quality reporting that is useful for policymakers.



In summary, we are looking for someone who has the intellectual capacity to perform and report high-quality analyses for diverse audiences. CNZ prioritises collaboration and distributed decision-making with technical and non-technical staff across the organisation at all stages of research and reporting. In this vein, you will work closely with a range of members of CNZ ‚Äì other researchers in CNZ‚Äôs Trials and Analysis team, as well as the Director of the team and our Chief Economist; project managers who liaise with partners and assist you in ensuring the fidelity of implementation to the pre-analysis plan; CNZ‚Äôs External Affairs team, to package our analyses into high-quality reporting and relevant recommendations; and CNZ‚Äôs leadership team, to ensure our research delivers as much impact as possible.

What You'll Need


Experience designing and analysing randomised controlled trials
Experience managing multiple simultaneous projects, with an ability to prioritise and adapt to changing circumstances
Experience handling and analysing large amounts of data, using clear, maintainable code, ideally in R or Python
Experience communicating coherently and handling multiple stakeholdersExperience delivering research collaboratively as part of a larger team
Experience setting up and analysing quasi-experimental designs (such as staggered difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity designs)



It would be great if you also have‚Ä¶


Experience working in energy is great, but not critical ‚Äì we‚Äôre looking for curiosity and an eagerness to learn more about the energy industry
Experience writing accessible, policy-facing summaries of researchExperience in empirical industrial organisation or public finance
Experience working directly with policymakers as well as academics
Facility using SQL to wrangle and process data

Join our startup-to-scaleup journey as an AI/ML Data Scientist. In this fully remote role, working from anywhere in Canada, you'll be part of an interdisciplinary team innovating our flagship assessment platform, Casper, with AI.

Working at the intersection of machine learning innovation and ethical AI in higher education, you'll work on complex, ambiguous problems, and lead the end-to-end design, build, and deployment of an AI-powered evaluation system.

This role offers you, a machine learning professional with advanced proficiency in Python and deep knowledge of ML libraries, the chance to work without a predefined playbook and grow your career with a people-focused company that values work-life balance, invests in learning, and creates products with real-world impact on education, admissions, and social equity.

The Future We're Building

Imagine a world powered by everyone's full potential.

That's what we're building at Acuity Insights.

Our company was founded on the need for a higher education admissions method that looks beyond academic performance and considers the whole student‚Äîtheir unique qualities, experiences, and strengths.

Today, our solutions help discover, nurture and realize people's potential, supporting holistic success from admissions to graduation for students, education programs, and higher education institutions across North America, the U.K., Australia, and the Gulf.

Our core assessment product, Casper, provides education programs with a more holistic view of applicants by evaluating their soft skills. Incorporating Casper's insights into the admissions process results in a larger applicant pool, enables student success, and graduates better professionals. Since 2014, Casper has been adopted by over 600 higher education programs, and more than 1 million applicants have registered to take the test.

With our core education program management solution, One45, we help medical schools and other health professions programs optimize the complex processes and critical components of their curriculum and student assessments to generate data-informed insights needed to graduate competent future healthcare professionals.

With our fast-growing data and insights solution, Analytics, we leverage critical integrations with our data warehouse and powerful dashboards to provide medical schools with deep insights and intelligence on student and program performance, powering real-time decision-making and continuous quality improvement.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies‚Äîfrom the world‚Äôs largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups‚Äîuse Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone‚Äôs reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We‚Äôre looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We‚Äôre looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You‚Äôll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it‚Äôs our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We‚Äôre looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $167,400 - $251,200. For sales roles, the range provided is the role‚Äôs On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate‚Äôs experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

You understand that clarity and simplicity -- in code and in communication -- are worth striving for
You have 5+ years of professional experience in software engineering and are able to present as an expert in client-facing situations


As a distributed team, some key qualities are particularly important for all of us at Hop Labs:


A strong sense of ownership and initiative: You take your task or issue seriously and proactively drive it start-to-finish
Clear and consistent communication: You can speak to lay people and engineers alike about issues, and keep teammates and clients informed on progress
A collaborative mindset: You approach your work as part of a larger team effort, and can take and give constructive feedback well
Clear thinking and attention to detail for complex projects: You are committed to a crisp understanding of what you're doing and why, paired with careful planning and attention to details
Comfort with operating independently as well as part of a small, targeted team: You are flexible in working successfully in either context, in a fully remote environment


What we're looking for specifically for this role:


Experience with construction and design of the entire ML pipeline, including training, deployment, and hosting in a production environment, using engineering best practices (e.g., unit testing, monitoring, logging)
Fluency in the Python ML/data science stack (e.g., PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Pandas)
Proficiency in cloud engineering (AWS/Azure/GCP) and infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Terraform or equivalent)
Proficiency with ETL/data pipelines and data stores
Facility with web application technologies (e.g., FastAPI, UI development)
Open to all backgrounds, though deep learning/LLM background strongly preferred


Residency and authorization to work in the U.S. or Canada is required.

If this role sounds like a good fit for you, please apply! We've made an effort to create a hiring process that is low-pressure, skills-focused, and compatible with the other commitments in your life.

Local Logic is digitizing the built world to make it universally understandable and actionable for consumers, investors, developers, and governments with the ambition of helping build cities that are more sustainable and equitable for the people who live in them.

To achieve that dream, we‚Äôve built a digital twin of cities, quantifying the built world using data and AI to interpret the $217T real estate market throughout the US and Canada.

We started our journey at McGill University‚Äôs urban planning department, where we came to see that cities were being developed in all kinds of unsustainable ways. Why were sprawling suburbs still being built, when doing so would increase pollution and inequality? Why were new business parks being built far from mass transit, when doing so would make traffic congestion skyrocket? Why was social housing being built in places that would exacerbate social problems rather than improve them?

It became clear to us why: cities are incredibly difficult to understand. However, we realized that with recent advances in data science, all the complexity of cities could be made simple enough for anyone to understand. And that understanding would be essential to making the sustainable, equitable, and prosperous cities that we so desperately need.

Today, Local Logic delivers sophisticated location insights through webtools, APIs, one-click reports and a data analytics platform. Our insights are powered by billions of data points we‚Äôve generated that describe all aspects of cities -- from the distance to the nearest bus stop, the quietness on the street, to the most recent trends in the housing market and more.

Your Mission

As Data Scientist at Local Logic, you will be responsible for quantitative research on cities and real estate, on the one hand, and our product usage, on the other hand ‚Äì all with the goal of helping to inform product strategy and to discover hidden value in our city and real estate data.

You are an agile researcher and strategist at your core, able to rapidly and creatively identify the right questions to ask, help others reframe their questions so they uncover bigger opportunities, understand the value of combining quantitative and qualitative exploratory and evaluative methods, and are excited about doing this at variable speeds and depths to respond to a constantly evolving start-up environment.

You believe in our mission and want to help us achieve it. You bring your own unique perspective to the team, so you can challenge the way we do things for the better. You‚Äôre able to speak up when you disagree, ask questions when you don‚Äôt understand, and take ownership of your work.

As Our Data Scientist, Your Responsibilities Will Include:


Conduct research on the value of our city and real estate data for the problems that matter for our target users and customers, which include home seekers, cities, real estate listing websites, and real estate developers and investors
Setup product analytics pipelines and reports for internal and external use
Develop the proof-of-concept for new data products and collaborate with data engineers to productionize them
Contribute to a culture of data-informed decision-making
Be a steward of data quality
Collaborate with product managers, developers, designers, other data scientists, and data engineers to contribute to product roadmap and requirements-gathering activities
Communicate across technical and non-technical teams internally about insights you generate in your analyses and about the strengths and risks of the methodologies and data you used to get there
Write reports for clients in French and English


Key Requirements:


At least 2 years of experience working as a data scientist in a company with very large quantities of data
At least 3 years of experience doing quantitative research (academic experience counts)
Experience with product analytics
Experience with machine learning and/or other modeling techniques
Experience with programming in Python and SQL for data analysis
Fluent in French and English
Embracing change. This is a startup environment and we sometimes pivot quickly
Embracing ambiguity. Figuring out the right thing to do is part of the job (rather than executing a perfectly specified plan)
This is a hybrid position and it is expected that you will work from the Montreal office 2 days a week


Nice to Have:


Domain knowledge about the real estate sector and urban planning, especially as it relates to real estate investment, zoning, city planning, etc
Experience working with geospatial, multivariate and spatio-temporal data


Why Should You Work Here?

At Local Logic, you have an amazing opportunity to be an early team member of a Series B backed startup. We are focused on understanding the world and its cities to predict the future and make the real estate market more transparent.

We are a people-first company that strives to create the best experience for our employees by creating an inclusive, collaborative, challenging environment to learn and problem-solve on a daily basis.

You will have access to benefits such as:


Comprehensive health insurance on us
A health platform (telemedicine, Employee and Family Assistance Program (EFAP), mental health and stress management assistance) (*for Canadians only)
Stock options
Unlimited vacation
Intentional Fridays
Health and benefit allowance per year
Initial WFH allowance
Bike sharing membership on us
A cool office in the heart of Montreal


Your professional development is our priority. With a 1500 CAD annual professional development credit you‚Äôre encouraged to keep learning, explore new skills, and advance in your career. We want you to thrive, grow, and feel fulfilled while working on work that matters. Join us, and help us build a brighter future for cities around the world.

Our Commitment to Diversity & Inclusion

We‚Äôre aiming to build a diverse team and inclusive company culture. We are an equal opportunity employer (EOE) and do not discriminate based on race, color, ethnicity, ancestry, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran status, genetic information, marital status or any legally protected status.

Notre Mission

Chez Local Logic, notre mission est d'am√©liorer toutes les d√©cisions immobili√®res, qu'il s'agisse des consommateurs √† la recherche d'un quartier qui correspond √† leur style de vie, des investisseurs qui cherchent √† rep√©rer les meilleurs emplacements √† d√©velopper, ou des gouvernements locaux qui s'efforcent de construire des villes plus durables gr√¢ce √† une meilleure planification urbaine.

Nous avons commenc√© notre parcours au d√©partement d'urbanisme de l'universit√© McGill, o√π nous avons constat√© que les villes se d√©veloppaient de toutes sortes de mani√®res non durables. Pourquoi continuer √† construire des banlieues tentaculaires, alors que cela a pour effet d'accro√Ætre la pollution et les in√©galit√©s ? Pourquoi de nouvelles zones d'activit√©s sont-elles construites loin des transports en commun, alors que cela fait exploser les embouteillages ? Pourquoi les logements sociaux sont-ils construits dans des endroits qui exacerbent les probl√®mes sociaux au lieu de les am√©liorer ?

Nous avons compris pourquoi : Les villes sont incroyablement difficiles √† comprendre. Mais, nous avons r√©alis√© qu'avec les progr√®s r√©cents de la science des donn√©es, toute la complexit√© des villes peut √™tre simplifi√©e pour que n'importe qui puisse la comprendre. Cette compr√©hension est essentielle pour cr√©er des villes durables, √©quitables et prosp√®res dont nous avons d√©sesp√©r√©ment besoin.

Aujourd'hui, notre vaste ensemble de plus de milliards de points de donn√©es fournit des informations et des analyses in√©gal√©es qui ont influenc√© des transactions immobili√®res d'une valeur de plusieurs milliards de dollars et qui aident en permanence plus de 15 millions d'utilisateurs mensuels, sur 8 000 sites web aux √âtats-Unis et au Canada, √† prendre des d√©cisions plus √©clair√©es.

Au cours de l'√©t√© 2023, nous avons obtenu un financement de s√©rie B afin d'agrandir notre √©quipe, d'am√©liorer nos produits et, en fin de compte, d'aider √† construire les villes de demain.

Votre Mission

En tant que scientifique de donn√©es chez Local Logic, vous √™tes responsable de faire de la recherche quantitative sur les villes et l'immobilier, d'une part, et de l'utilisation de nos produits, d'autre part, le tout dans le but d'aider √† √©clairer la strat√©gie produit et √† d√©couvrir la valeur cach√©e dans nos donn√©es urbaines et immobili√®res.

Vous √™tes un chercheur et un strat√®ge agile, capable d'identifier rapidement et de mani√®re cr√©ative les bonnes questions √† poser et d'aider les autres √† recadrer leurs questions afin qu'ils d√©couvrent de plus grandes opportunit√©s. Vous avez de l'int√©r√™t pour combiner des m√©thodes quantitatives et qualitatives, et vous √™tes enthousiaste de travailler dans un environnement de start-up en constante √©volution.

Vous croyez en notre mission et souhaitez nous aider √† la r√©aliser. Vous apportez votre propre perspective unique √† l‚Äô√©quipe, afin de pouvoir remettre en question notre fa√ßon de faire les choses pour le mieux. Vous √™tes capable de vous exprimer lorsque vous n‚Äô√™tes pas d‚Äôaccord, de poser des questions lorsque vous ne comprenez pas et de vous approprier votre travail.

En tant que Data Scientist, vos responsabilit√©s incluront :


Mener des recherches sur la valeur de nos donn√©es sur les villes et l'immobilier pour les probl√®mes importants pour nos utilisateurs et clients cibles, notamment les villes, les sites Web d'annonces immobili√®res, ainsi que les promoteurs et investisseurs immobiliers
Mettre en place les cha√Ænes de traitement de donn√©es pour l'analyse de produits ainsi que des rapports √† usage interne et externe
D√©velopper la preuve de concept pour les nouveaux produits de donn√©es et collaborer avec les ing√©nieurs de donn√©es pour les mettre en production

Promouvoir une culture de la qualit√© des donn√©es
Collaborer avec les chefs de produit, les d√©veloppeurs, d'autres scientifiques de donn√©es et ing√©nieurs de donn√©es pour contribuer √† la feuille de route du produit et aux activit√©s de collecte des exigences
Communiquer en interne entre les √©quipes techniques et non techniques sur les informations que vous g√©n√©rez dans vos analyses et sur les avantages et les risques des m√©thodologies et des donn√©es que vous avez utilis√©es pour y parvenir
R√©diger des rapports pour les clients en fran√ßais et en anglais


Exigences cl√©s :


Au moins 2 ans d'exp√©rience en tant que scientifique des donn√©es dans une entreprise avec de tr√®s grandes quantit√©s de donn√©es

Appr√©cier l‚Äôambigu√Øt√©. D√©terminer la bonne chose √† faire fait partie du travail (plut√¥t que d'ex√©cuter un plan parfaitement sp√©cifi√©)
Il s'agit d'un poste hybride et il est pr√©vu que vous travailliez depuis le bureau de Montr√©al 2 jours par semaine


Pourquoi travailler ici

Rejoignez-nous et aidez-nous √† construire un avenir meilleur pour les villes du monde entier.

How can we develop a technical model to predict ride wait times and communicate this to drivers?
What is the most helpful way to display ride information to drivers so they can make informed decisions?
What rider segments should we target with ride incentives to grow our marketshare for these verticals?


Responsibilities


Leverage data and analytic frameworks to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency, recommending technical solutions to drive business impact
Construct and fit statistical or machine learning models to make production decisions such as changes to ride offerings; focusing on model proposal and offline model development
Design and analyze online experiments; communicate results and act on launch decisions
Partner with product managers, engineers, marketers, designers, and operators to translate data insights into decisions and action
Develop analytical frameworks to monitor business and product performance, leveraging experiments and causal inference
Establish metrics that measure the health of our products, the business, as well as the driver experience

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies‚Äîfrom the world‚Äôs largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups‚Äîuse Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone‚Äôs reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We‚Äôre looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We‚Äôre looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You‚Äôll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it‚Äôs our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We‚Äôre looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area or San Francisco Bay Area



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $167,400 - $251,200. For sales roles, the range provided is the role‚Äôs On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate‚Äôs experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

100% remote, primarily based in the U.S
10-15 team members, depending on our project mix at any given time
Exclusively focused on technical consulting around production-scale machine learning
Results-oriented work environment with a lot of flexibility -- we value life outside of work

You understand that clarity and simplicity -- in code and in communication -- are worth striving for
You have 5+ years of professional experience in software engineering and are able to present as an expert in client-facing situations


As a distributed team, some key qualities are particularly important for all of us at Hop Labs:


A strong sense of ownership and initiative: You take your task or issue seriously and proactively drive it start-to-finish
Clear and consistent communication: You can speak to lay people and engineers alike about issues, and keep teammates and clients informed on progress
A collaborative mindset: You approach your work as part of a larger team effort, and can take and give constructive feedback well
Clear thinking and attention to detail for complex projects: You are committed to a crisp understanding of what you're doing and why, paired with careful planning and attention to details
Comfort with operating independently as well as part of a small, targeted team: You are flexible in working successfully in either context, in a fully remote environment


What we're looking for specifically for this role:


Experience with construction and design of the entire ML pipeline, including training, deployment, and hosting in a production environment, using engineering best practices (e.g., unit testing, monitoring, logging)

Proficiency in cloud engineering (AWS/Azure/GCP) and infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Terraform or equivalent)
Proficiency with ETL/data pipelines and data stores
Facility with web application technologies (e.g., FastAPI, UI development)
Open to all backgrounds, though deep learning/LLM background strongly preferred


Residency and authorization to work in the U.S. or Canada is required.

If this role sounds like a good fit for you, please apply! We've made an effort to create a hiring process that is low-pressure, skills-focused, and compatible with the other commitments in your life.

Benefits

For our employees, we offer:


Medical, dental, and vision benefits
Life and disability insurance
Paid holidays and vacation time
Flexible work schedules

We‚Äôre redefining how humans interact with massive amounts of imagery & video.




What that means

We‚Äôre building a near future where people can get information out of imagery at scale without building their own ML models. Collaborating with users around the world, our AI research and products change how people monitor and protect our oceans.




Our core technology: Find Anything & Video Search. We make it possible to find anything in imagery/video, without having seen it in training. Advancing the field of computer vision, pioneered in-house at OnDeck and published at one of the world‚Äôs most distinguished AI conferences (NeurIPS).¬†




Backed by National Geographic, the Environmental Defense Fund, Canada‚Äôs Ocean Supercluster, and many more, we stand at the forefront of AI for ocean conservation & protection. Our software has been deployed by governments, Indigenous nations, scientists, NGOs, and industry around the world.¬†




What you'll be doing

We‚Äôre excited to be pushing the boundaries of what is possible in computer vision: creating grounded visual reasoning & fine-grained classification, and searching for absolutely anything in thousands of hours of video footage. What you‚Äôll be doing is extending our NeurIPS workshop paper across several domains, scaling it to thousands of classes, and bridging the gap between video understanding models and our methods. We‚Äôll provide the dedicated cloud GPUs and research autonomy for you to keep pushing the boundaries of visual reasoning.




You‚Äôll have the opportunity to work alongside our engineering team to bring this applied research into reality, watching as your research turns into real products in just a few weeks. And you‚Äôll get to publish to conferences and journals too.




Impact and scope of work

Develop state-of-the-art machine learning models that can reason about visual data and retrieve relevant answers from external knowledge sources.¬†
Research, implement, and optimize for various tasks, including object detection, species classification, and multi-object tracking for scalable ocean vision systems and environmental monitoring.
Devise better data-driven models for information retrieval, hierarchical classification, multi-modal fusion, generation and media understanding (CV & NLP).
Collaborate with engineers to translate research into products, as well as¬†communicating research plans, progress, results, and impact to the whole organization and in conference/journal papers.
Collaborate and work across teams to develop concepts that advance the entire product pipeline, all the way to production (infrastructure, software, data collection, machine learning, etc.).
Conduct research that enables learning the semantics of data across multiple modalities (images, video, text, physical sensors, and other modalities).




You will also get visibility of the business and product side, and see how OnDeck is commercializing machine learning systems and infrastructure to deliver recurring value to customers and real change to ocean sustainability.




Minimum Qualifications

Ph.D. degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or relevant technical field.
Experience as a machine learning researcher, including internships and full-time.
Proficiency in programming and implementing machine learning workflows using Python (experience with C, C++, and JavaScript/TypeScript is an asset)
Research experience with vision language models/large vision models, multi-modal encoder-decoder design, domain adaptation of open-vocabulary models, information retrieval problems, or other areas related to NLP and CV.
Proven track record of achieving significant results as demonstrated by awards, fellowships, patents, as well as first-authored publications at leading journals or conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, JMLR, AAAI, KDD, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ACL, NAACL, EACL, or similar.
Experience communicating research for public audiences of peers.
Experience manipulating and analyzing complex, large scale, potentially high-dimensionality data from varying sources.
Experience in utilizing theoretical and empirical research to solve problems.
Strong technical communication skills in English, both written and verbal
Enthusiasm for research that revolutionizes visual reasoning and ocean tech




Preferred Qualifications

Previous work experience designing and implementing ML models in production environments
Extensive experience in machine learning products, computer vision-as-a-service, serving ML models, and/or optimizing model performance
Experience in software engineering including cloud/edge development, Unix/Linux environments, distributed and parallel systems, and data engineering
Proficiency with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and multiple machine learning frameworks/tools
Authorized to work in Canada (work permit or other).

C‚Äôest donc pour cela que la flexibilit√© d‚Äôhoraires et de conditions de travail fait partie de notre culture. Lorsque nous nous sentons soutenus au travail comme √† la maison, il n‚Äôy a rien que nous ne puissions accomplir dans l‚Äôenvironnement de l‚Äôinfonuagique.

You will be a key driver in taking something from an idea to an experiment to a prototype and finally to a live production system.

Our team packs a punch with principal level product, science, engineering, and leadership talent. We are a results focused team and you have the opportunity to lead and establish a culture for the big things to come. We combine the culture of a startup, the innovation and creativity of a R&D Lab, the work-life balance of a mature organization, and technical challenges at the scale of AWS. We offer a playground of opportunities for builders to build, have fun, and make history!

About The Team

Diverse Experiences

AWS values diverse experiences. Even if you do not meet all of the qualifications and skills listed in the job description, we encourage candidates to apply. If your career is just starting, hasn‚Äôt followed a traditional path, or includes alternative experiences, don‚Äôt let it stop you from applying.

Why AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world‚Äôs most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. We pioneered cloud computing and never stopped innovating ‚Äî that‚Äôs why customers from the most successful startups to Global 500 companies trust our robust suite of products and services to power their businesses.

Inclusive Team Culture

Here at AWS, it‚Äôs in our nature to learn and be curious. Our employee-led affinity groups foster a culture of inclusion that empower us to be proud of our differences. Ongoing events and learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences, inspire us to never stop embracing our uniqueness.

Mentorship & Career Growth

We‚Äôre continuously raising our performance bar as we strive to become Earth‚Äôs Best Employer. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôll find endless knowledge-sharing, mentorship and other career-advancing resources here to help you develop into a better-rounded professional.

Work/Life Balance

We value work-life harmony. Achieving success at work should never come at the expense of sacrifices at home, which is why we strive for flexibility as part of our working culture. When we feel supported in the workplace and at home, there‚Äôs nothing we can‚Äôt achieve in the cloud.

Hybrid Work

We value innovation and recognize this sometimes requires uninterrupted time to focus on a build. We also value in-person collaboration and time spent face-to-face. Our team affords employees options to work in the office every day or in a flexible, hybrid work model near one of our U.S. Amazon offices.
