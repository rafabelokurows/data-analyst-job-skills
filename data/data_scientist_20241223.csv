We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $136,000 - $230,000 per year.

By clicking “Submit Application”, I understand and agree that Notion and its affiliates and subsidiaries will collect and process my information in accordance with Notion’s Global Recruiting Privacy Policy.

As a Data Scientist at Kikoff, you work closely with cross functional teams incl. Product, Engineering, Data Engineering, Marketing, Operation. By applying your technical skills, analytical mindset, and product intuition, you will help our customers improve their financial security. You will use data to identify and solve product development’s biggest challenges. Your responsibilities includes:


Product leadership: use data to shape product development, quantify new opportunities, set goals, identify upcoming challenges, and ensure the products we build bring value to our customers.
Analytics: develop hypotheses and employ a diverse toolkit of rigorous analytical approaches, different methodologies, frameworks, and technical approaches to test them.
Communication and influence: convince and influence your partners by telling clear data stories.


Qualifications


Bachelors’ or above in quantitative discipline: Statistics, Applied Mathematics, Economics, Computer Science, Engineering, or related field
A minimum of 2 years of work experience in analytics
Expert knowledge of SQL and experience with Python
Deep understanding of statistical analysis, experimentation design, and common analytical techniques like regression, decision trees
Strong verbal and written communication skills
A humble collaborative can-do attitude and natural curiosity


What We’re Like


Scrappy. We had a product goal and put out the MVP, collecting our first users with steady growth via paid channels in four months. We don’t cut corners when we know we’ll need them but we don’t build things without that need. We don’t like inefficiency but we dislike operationalizing one-off tasks even more.
Risk-oriented. Everything has risk, but a mature team knows how to make these tradeoffs. That’s why we built the MVP fast––because time is your most valuable asset and is practically fungible with money in the startup world.
Data-obsessed. We all look at data and pull it, and we believe that understanding the mechanics can yield valuable insights. Complex systems require elegant, not just simple solutions. You absolutely need to be interested in data if you want to leverage your knowledge of systems.
Lucky. That’s how we look at this journey so far. From our timing of fundraising, to the circumstances in which we came together, to the initial product traction we’re getting, there’s no other word to describe it. We are grateful you are reading this, and we know that if you’re meant to be with us on this journey, then we will see you soon.

About The Job

As an organization, Google maintains a portfolio of research projects driven by fundamental research, new product innovation, product contribution and infrastructure goals, while providing individuals and teams the freedom to emphasize specific types of work. As a Research Scientist, you'll setup large-scale tests and deploy promising ideas quickly and broadly, managing deadlines and deliverables while applying the latest theories to develop new and improved products, processes, or technologies. From creating experiments and prototyping implementations to designing new architectures, our research scientists work on real-world problems that span the breadth of computer science, such as machine (and deep) learning, data mining, natural language processing, hardware and software performance analysis, improving compilers for mobile platforms, as well as core search and much more.

As a Research Scientist, you'll also actively contribute to the wider research community by sharing and publishing your findings, with ideas inspired by internal projects as well as from collaborations with research programs at partner universities and technical institutes all over the world.

One of the requirements from generative models like Gemini is to produce outputs that are consistent with their input context, grounded in real world factual information and offer attribution to support their claims. These needs become more challenging as generative models contexts are longer and more complex. In this role, you will research new modeling approaches for improving the grounding and factuality of Google's Large Language Models that power prominent Google products such as search Artificial Intelligence (AI) Overviews, Gemini Chat, Cloud Vertex AI and YouTube.

Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software developers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world's fast-paced business needs.

The US base salary range for this full-time position is $136,000-$200,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. The range displayed on each job posting reflects the minimum and maximum target salaries for the position across all US locations. Within the range, individual pay is determined by work location and additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your preferred location during the hiring process.

Descartes was born out of the conviction that the ever-increasing complexity of risks faced by corporations, governments and vulnerable communities calls for a renewed approach in insurance. Our team brings together industry veterans from the most renowned institutions (AXA, SCOR, Swiss Re, Marsh, Aon, ...) and scientists on top of their field to bring underwriting excellence. After 5 years of existence, Descartes has secured a leading position in parametric insurance for weather and climate-related risks utilizing machine learning, real-time monitoring from satellite imagery & IoT. After a successful Series B raise of $120M USD, we launched Descartes Insurance, a 'full stack' insurer licensed to underwrite risk by the French regulator ACPR. With a growing corporate client base (400+ and counting), our diverse team is headquartered in Paris and operates out of our 17 global offices in North America, Europe, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. Descartes is trusted by a panel of A-rated (re)insurers to carry out its activities.







ABOUT YOUR ROLE

Due to rapid growth, at the core of our company’s strategy, we are seeking to expand our Data science team, either across our *Underwriting* or our *R&D* functions.

On the other hand, the Underwriting team takes action subsequently in structuring and pricing of parametric insurance covers to deliver insurance products to a worldwide based public sector and corporate clients.




These roles will allow you to gain knowledge of the insurance industry and the emerging risks (natural catastrophes, cyber…), all while collaborating closely with other internal teams (Software, Operations, Legal and Commercial) and our external partners.




If you are interested in joining the Underwriting team, your key missions will include:

Conducting structuring work, risk analysis and insurance proposal for worldwide public sector and corporate clients;
Discussing business opportunities with Descartes’ partners and being responsible for technical documentation and insurance contracts redaction;
Collaborating with the business team to understand client needs and issues to further improve our product offering;
Participating in the development of Descartes’ technological platform to differentiate Descartes from its competitors (nat cat models and pricing tools);
Working autonomously and pragmatically to make appropriate technical decisions with attention to details.




If you are interested in joining the R&D team, your key missions will include:

Developing new models to improve our understanding of climate risks;
Conducting research and identifying new and innovative ideas on the modeling of climate risks and machine learning methods;
Testing state-of-the-art methods from scratch based on recent research articles;
Collaborating with the Underwriting, Business and Software teams to ensure our products are efficiently integrated into the underwriting process and meet our client’s needs;
Working autonomously and pragmatically to make appropriate technical decisions.

          <p><strong>ABOUT DESCARTES UNDERWRITING</strong></p><p>Descartes was born out of the conviction that the ever-increasing complexity of risks faced by corporations, governments and vulnerable communities calls for a renewed approach in insurance. Our team brings together industry veterans from the most renowned institutions (AXA, SCOR, Swiss Re, Marsh, Aon, ...) and scientists on top of their field to bring underwriting excellence. After 5 years of existence, Descartes has secured a leading position in parametric insurance for weather and climate-related risks utilizing machine learning, real-time monitoring from satellite imagery &amp; IoT. After a successful Series B raise of $120M USD, we launched Descartes Insurance, a 'full stack' insurer licensed to underwrite risk by the French regulator ACPR.

We may then invite you to submit a video interview for the review of the hiring manager. This video interview is often followed by a test or short project that allows us to determine whether you will be a good fit for the team.
At this point, we will invite you to interview with our hiring manager and/or the interview team. Please note: We do not conduct interviews via text message, Telegram, etc. and we never hire anyone into our organization without having met you face-to-face (or via Zoom). You will be invited to come to a live meeting or Zoom, where you will meet our INFUSE team.
From there on, it’s decision time! If you are still excited to join INFUSE and we like you as much, we will have a conversation about your offer. We do not make offers without giving you the opportunity to speak with us live. After all, we consider our team members our family, and we want you to feel comfortable and welcomed.

Meet Your Team: WAVE Data Science

Did you know that in-app ads are sold in a real-time auction before they get rendered in thousands of mobile apps? Dozens of ad networks compete for every single view, choosing their best ad and deciding what price to bid in just a couple hundred milliseconds. We at adjoe have developed our own ad network that takes part in this competition, fighting against giants like Google, Meta and TikTok to present its own ads. To stand a chance in this fierce competition, the WAVE Data Science team builds creative algorithms using technologies ranging from simple linear regression to advanced deep learning models. Everything we do is based on solid research about user behavior as well as publisher and advertiser analysis to build competitive bidding algorithms that balance the advertisers’ goals, the publishers’ expectations and of course the user experience. To make our inventions come to life we use state-of-the art technology and work closely with the product and business teams to shape the future of adjoe’s core business and technologies.

Vos missions / Your job description

Le projet WildPosh (Pan-european assessment, monitoring, and mitigation of chemical stressors on the health of wild pollinators) rassemble 17 partenaires de 10 pays européens. Il a pour principal objectif d’améliorer significativement l’évaluation du risque des pollinisateurs sauvages par rapport aux pesticides et d’améliorer la santé des pollinisateurs et du service de pollinisation en Europe. Dans le cadre d’une section du projet dédiée à la collecte de données, vous devrez créer un jeu de données portant sur l’usage des pesticides au niveau national et les données écotoxicologiques concernant les pollinisateurs, afin de définir des scenarios d’exposition et de toxicité. Au sein de l’Unité de Pathologie de l’Abeille et en lien avec la pilote de la tâche « Collection on ecotox end points », vous devrez chercher puis rassembler les données déjà existantes, disponibles sur différents supports (dans la littérature scientifique, dans des bases de données européennes ou nationales). Dans un second temps, vous devrez analyser statistiquement ces données afin de les décrire et d’en dégager des points forts et des axes d’amélioration.




The WildPosh project (Pan-European assessment, monitoring, and mitigation of chemical stressors on the health of wild pollinators) gathers 17 partners of 10 European countries. WildPosh is a multi-actors, transdisciplinary project whose overarching mission and ambition are to significantly improve the evaluation of the risk to wild pollinators of pesticide exposure, and enhance the sustainable health of pollinators and pollination services in Europe. In a work package dedicated to data collection, you will develop a dataset to collate data on pesticide exposure and effects, other stressors able to amplify adverse effects on pollinators and pesticide use at national level. The objective is to define exposure and toxicity scenarios. Working within the Unit of Honeybee Pathology, and supervised by the task leader, you will identify various sources of data such as scientific literature, European and national databases. You will look for and gather existing data. Subsequently, you will statistically analyse these data to describe key strengths and areas of improvement.

Het Nationaal Dataportaal Wegverkeer (NDW) speelt een sleutelrol in het verzamelen en verwerken van verkeersdata om de bereikbaarheid, verkeersveiligheid en duurzaamheid in Nederland te verbeteren.

Als data scientist bij NDW werk je in een gedreven Scrum team aan innovatieve oplossingen, zoals machine learning-modellen en verkeersvoorspellingen. Je verbetert de kwaliteit van complexe datasets en vertaalt analyses naar impactvolle inzichten voor wegbeheerders, appbouwers en beleidsmakers. Met jouw analytische vaardigheden draag je direct bij aan slimmer en duurzamer verkeersmanagement. Wil jij impact maken met data? Solliciteer direct!

Hoe jij bijdraagt in jouw rol

Als data scientist bij NDW werk je in een dynamische Agile omgeving waar verkeersdata en technologie samenkomen. Je speelt een cruciale rol in het verbeteren van datakwaliteit en het ontwikkelen van innovatieve oplossingen zoals verkeersvoorspellingen, machine learning en beeldherkenning. Door complexe uitdagingen te vertalen naar concrete resultaten draag je direct bij aan slimme en duurzame mobiliteitsoplossingen.

Samen met het datakwaliteit DevOps-team werk je aan user stories die datakwaliteit verbeteren en nieuwe inzichten bieden. Je ontwikkelt en implementeert modellen, analyseert datasets en visualiseert resultaten om kwaliteitsproblemen te detecteren en op te lossen. Ook draag je bij aan de ontwikkeling van software waarmee klanten data optimaal kunnen benutten.

You will develop and deploy models that enable scalable curation of RWD. This will include multi-source integrations and reconciliations, creating derived features from the source data (e.g., abstraction of clinical concepts from unstructured data), and facilitating data quality assessments. You will work with a diverse cross-functional team to build reusable and scalable tools and to deliver products that unlock information from structured and unstructured clinical data.

Responsibilities


Work closely with cross-functional partners to design and create longitudinal datasets integrating multiple data sources.
Build and implement highly accurate machine learning models / AI tools using sparsely labeled healthcare datasets.
Implement, build on and augment existing LLM/NLP tools to maximize the value of using unstructured medical data across a range of research and care applications.
Become an expert in our data’s capabilities and limitations. Solve difficult, non-routine analysis problems, handling data challenges from a real-world setting.
Communicate technical methods and results clearly in well structured reports and presentations to a range of technical and non-technical audiences.


Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications


Advanced degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., data sciences, statistics, biomedical informatics, computer science, applied mathematics, or similar), or equivalent practical experience.
2+ years experience applying advanced machine learning and AI techniques (supervised and unsupervised methods, LLMs, NLP) to clinical data.
Direct experience working with and curating real-world data, such as EHR, including a deep understanding of the complexities of this structured and unstructured clinical data.
Strong proficiency in Python.


Preferred Qualifications


Familiarity with medical terminologies and ontologies.
Familiarity with software engineering practices and experience developing production software.
Experience working with clinical subject matter experts.
Ability to work cross-functionally on teams, with a tolerance for ambiguity.
Creative and methodical problem solving: understand needs, identify options, form hypotheses, generate robust results, make informed decisions, and learn faster through feedback.
