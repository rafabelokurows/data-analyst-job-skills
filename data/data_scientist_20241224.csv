Join our startup-to-scaleup journey as an AI/ML Data Scientist. In this fully remote role, working from anywhere in Canada, you'll be part of an interdisciplinary team innovating our flagship assessment platform, Casper, with AI.

Working at the intersection of machine learning innovation and ethical AI in higher education, you'll work on complex, ambiguous problems, and lead the end-to-end design, build, and deployment of an AI-powered evaluation system.

This role offers you, a machine learning professional with advanced proficiency in Python and deep knowledge of ML libraries, the chance to work without a predefined playbook and grow your career with a people-focused company that values work-life balance, invests in learning, and creates products with real-world impact on education, admissions, and social equity.

The Future We're Building

Imagine a world powered by everyone's full potential.

That's what we're building at Acuity Insights.

Our company was founded on the need for a higher education admissions method that looks beyond academic performance and considers the whole student—their unique qualities, experiences, and strengths.

Today, our solutions help discover, nurture and realize people's potential, supporting holistic success from admissions to graduation for students, education programs, and higher education institutions across North America, the U.K., Australia, and the Gulf.

Our core assessment product, Casper, provides education programs with a more holistic view of applicants by evaluating their soft skills. Incorporating Casper's insights into the admissions process results in a larger applicant pool, enables student success, and graduates better professionals. Since 2014, Casper has been adopted by over 600 higher education programs, and more than 1 million applicants have registered to take the test.

With our core education program management solution, One45, we help medical schools and other health professions programs optimize the complex processes and critical components of their curriculum and student assessments to generate data-informed insights needed to graduate competent future healthcare professionals.

With our fast-growing data and insights solution, Analytics, we leverage critical integrations with our data warehouse and powerful dashboards to provide medical schools with deep insights and intelligence on student and program performance, powering real-time decision-making and continuous quality improvement.

Role & Opportunity Overview

As an AI/ML Data Scientist, you will join our Research team, which includes experts from the humanities, social sciences, and hard sciences. Research underpins our company's mission and provides data-driven, ethical insights. The team has been at the forefront of developing assessment methodologies that move beyond traditional metrics and ensure our products' scientific integrity and reliability.

In this role, you'll report to Jill Derby, our Senior Research Manager, and partner closely with Cole Walsh, our Research Scientist, on your initial project. You'll also collaborate closely with key team members from Rating, Content and New Product Development, as well as with product directors, product marketing managers, and design and engineering teams.

In your first 12 months, you get to lead the development of our first AI-powered evaluation system for the Casper platform, leveraging machine learning to transform how we assess applicants. You'll oversee the entire process, from data collection and validation to model training, implementation, and monitoring, while addressing challenges like aligning with human rater standards and ensuring demographic fairness.

Your work will drive significant business impact, including market scalability, operational efficiency, and an improved applicant experience. Over time, you'll expand to other market verticals, optimize product offerings, and lead responsible AI innovations to tackle key growth challenges.

As our AI/ML Data Scientist, you'll also help build a world-class AI and machine learning practice, define processes, tackle uncharted problems, and shape how AI/ML capabilities are embedded within Acuity Insights. Drawing from your expertise, you'll lead transformative AI projects, set performance benchmarks, and embed fairness and explainability at every stage. Your work will deliver scalable, impactful solutions that align with our ethical standards and foster trust across diverse partners.
