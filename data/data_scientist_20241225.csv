Context And Mission

The Global Health Resilience (GHR) group led by ICREA Research Professor Rachel Lowe at the BSC-CNS is seeking a highly motivated data scientist to co-create robust harmonised datasets and dashboards for decision-support tools to enhance surveillance, preparedness, and response to global health challenges, including climate-sensitive infectious diseases.

The GHR group conducts cutting-edge methodological research on disentangling the impacts of global environmental change on infectious disease risk and co-developing impact-based forecasting models at sub-seasonal to decadal timescales in collaboration with public health, disaster risk management, and humanitarian agencies. The GHR group works closely with the Earth System Services (ESS) group, whose mission is to research the impact of weather, atmospheric chemistry and climate upon socio-economic sectors, including renewable energy, agriculture, water management, forest fires, urban development and health and demonstrate the ongoing value of earth system services to society and the economy.

The selected candidate will conduct data audits and exploratory data reports to summarise characteristics, biases and completeness of both open-source and stakeholder provided data to provide decision-support at multiple spatial scales and different forecasting horizons. They will perform data linkage, involving post-processing, downscaling, integration, harmonization and machine learning techniques, and visualization of multi-source, multi-scale epidemiological, climatic, environmental, demographic, socio-economic, human movement, and health systems datasets. They will develop dashboards to summarise and visualisation multi-sourced data and facilitate communication with the team and stakeholders and prepare and deliver material for stakeholder training and capacity building activities. The successful candidate will work in close collaboration with the Data and Diagnostics team that co-develops the analysis packages. This position presents an opportunity to work alongside a wide range of leading international climate and health scientists delivering cutting-edge climate services for the health sector to inform policymakers in Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia, Europe, and worldwide.

Successful candidates will benefit from expert training and BSC-CNS staff benefits: international multidisciplinary scientific environment and advanced applied research training. We encourage applications from highly motivated candidates with demonstrated experience in impact modelling for public health and an interest in applied research in the context of climate and environmental change.

About Us

Our mission is to help companies and individuals solve data analytics problems by covering the full spectrum of the data journey (from ingestion, transformation and finally distribution of data to downstream applications) with a Modern Data Stack. Most companies are lacking internal knowledge to leverage the limitless power of emerging Modern Data Stack tools and our goal is to educate them and implement powerful solutions with those technologies.

We achieve this by creating a new type of consulting company:


Embracing a culture that prioritizes creativity and strategic thinking
Incorporating education as one of our key output in each project we deliver
Ensuring the growth and well-being of our employees


Regarding our technology stack, we are a Google Cloud partner and host most of our solutions on Google Cloud. On the data side, we are relying on a Modern Data Stack and are savvy users of dbt, Airflow and Airbyte. We are always on the lookout for the best technologies and adapt ourselves quickly to market trends.

In this role, you'll be developing the tools and technology for building and maintaining this new generation of container images. You'll be working with multiple teams, both inside and outside Canonical, to ensure we deliver container images with the highest quality whilst maintaining a seamless Ubuntu user experience.

About The Role

Our Technology team isn‚Äôt just one of the best in the industry. It's one of the best in the world. And we‚Äôre proud of it. It‚Äôs our driving force ‚Äî our engine üöÄ

From building a new financial backend to creating an innovative app, there‚Äôs nothing they can‚Äôt do. Our Technology team isn‚Äôt here to fix legacy systems ‚Äî it‚Äôs here to build world-class financial features from the ground up that'll be used by millions of people around the world üåé

You may expect our Python Engineers to work on heavily regulated financial systems, but we love the unexpected. We‚Äôre better known internally for writing high-quality code and building complex novel solutions end-to-end.

These geniuses have created our chatbot ‚Äî the lovely Rita ‚Äî and they didn‚Äôt stop there. They also created automated financial crime quality controls in just a few weeks. They‚Äôre that good.

You‚Äôll never work alone, either. As a Python Engineer, you‚Äôll sit within a Product Team simultaneously working with Data Scientists, Analysts, Engineers, Product Owners, and Operations Managers to solve problems and make our rocket ship fly even higher.

What You‚Äôll Be Doing


Building APIs, making sure they're properly designed and scaled according to business needs
Creating data pipelines to pull data from production services into our data warehouse, powering reporting, data analytics, and data science
Writing event consumers to build new data models for new flows and processes


What You'll Need


5+ years of experience working as a Software Engineer
3+ years of experience engineering with Python as your primary language
An academic background in STEM
Fluency in Python, SQL, and other OOPLs
Experience with API development and integration
A practical understanding of distributed systems
The ability to write concurrent code in IO/CPU bound situations
Experience with Docker, K8s, Ansible, Teamcity, monitoring, and alerting


Nice to have


Experience with prototyping and sketching
Multiple side projects or open source contributions
Exposure to GCP
Experience with Django Framework
