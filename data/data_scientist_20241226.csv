Smartcat is on a mission to become the wall-to-wall Language AI platform, addressing the diverse needs in multilingual content for various user personas within global enterprises.

Smartcat is uniquely positioned within the $100+ billion multilingual content industry, which is currently served by tens of thousands of agencies. This results in a highly fragmented and inefficient supply chain, high costs, unacceptable turnaround times, and quality issues. Using highly qualified internal resources to translate or create multilingual content (insourcing) solves the quality problem for enterprises, but if done manually, it can't solve for scalability, high cost, and slow turnaround.

Smartcat changes the ROI equation in favor of insourcing with its Language AI platform for enterprise end-users. It delivers high-quality, instantaneous AI translations or generates new content in any language by tapping into a customer-specific multilingual content library. The AI output is further refined through human editing by the client's internal reviewers or experts from the Smartcat's embedded global marketplace of linguists and content editors. This AI output continuously improves through the editing feedback loop, ensuring consistent and customer-tailored results.

More than 1,000 global companies including ~20% of the Fortune 1,000 trust Smartcat to communicate their innovations and ideas all over the world.

As a dynamic Series C company, Smartcat is growing at 130% YoY, thanks to the high and quick ROI it delivers to global enterprises. It's well-funded by notable VCs, and is capital efficient, offering a unique blend of hyper-growth potential with downside protection and the capacity for long-term planning and strategy.

We always strive to do better. That means venturing beyond our comfort zones, learning from our mistakes, and helping each other grow.

Diversity and Inclusion

Diversity is one of our biggest strengths. Our differences are what make us distinct. We respect each other and believe in equal opportunities for all.

Diversity & Inclusion

Diversity is not a vision of the future or something we wish to have one day, it is a non-negotiable value of who we are.

We practice inclusion, plurality, and respect. And we count on the governance of the Diversity Committee, which works together with HR, leadership and identity groups - 99Adapta, 99Afro, 99Cores, 99Mulheres, and 99Mamães. This part of our journey has been written, there remains a long road before us.

We reinforce that this position is open to everyone, including pregnant people and people with disabilities (PwD).
