Almost 600,000 tech employees have been laid off since 2022 and it's still ongoing. The effect of this has led hundreds of thousands of laid off Tech employees competing with existing Jobseekers.

Entry level Job seekers struggle to get responses to their applications, are getting ghosted after interviews. In such a scenario the Job seekers need to differentiate themselves by ensuring to obtain exceptional skills and technologies so that they can wear multiple roles at a client as clients now would want to expand roles and responsibilities assigned to a particular job to save costs.

Since 2010 Synergisticit has helped Jobseekers differentiate themselves by providing candidates the requisite skills and experience to outperform at interviews and clients. Here at SynergisticIT We just don't focus on getting you a Job we make careers.

All Positions are open for all visas and US citizens

We are matchmakers we provide clients with candidates who can perform from day 1 of starting work. In this challenging economy every client wants to save $$$​'s and they want the best value for their money. Jobseekers need to self-evaluate if they have the requisite skills to meet client requirements and needs as Clients now post covid can also hire remote workers which increases even more competition for jobseekers

.We at Synergisticit understand the problem of the mismatch between employer's requirements and Employee skills and that's why since 2010 we have helped 1000's of candidates get jobs at technology clients like apple, google, Paypal, western union, Client, visa, walmart labs etc to name a few

.We have an excellent reputation with the clients. Currently, We are looking for entry-level software programmers, Java Full stack developers, Python/Java developers, Data analysts/ Data Scientists, Machine Learning engineers for full time positions with clients

.Who Should Apply Recent Computer science/Engineering /Mathematics/Statistics or Science Graduates or People looking to switch careers or who have had gaps in employment and looking to make their careers in the Tech Industry

. We assist in filing for STEM extension and also for H1b and Green card filing to Candidate

Working at Atlassian

Atlassians can choose where they work – whether in an office, from home, or a combination of the two. That way, Atlassians have more control over supporting their family, personal goals, and other priorities. We can hire people in any country where we have a legal entity. Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company.

Atlassian is looking for a Machine Learning Engineer to join our Core Machine Learning team based in Mountain View, CA. The Core Machine Learning team builds and deploys ML modeling solutions to drive revenue generation, expand our active user base and provide sophisticated forecasting for company top-line metrics. This is accomplished by driving the complete end-to-end ML development cycle. This is a unique opportunity to work in a collaborative environment, implement the cutting edge machine learning techniques, especially recommendation systems, and tackle challenging and distinctive problems.

That's the specific reason there are so many techies both experience and freshers who are unemployed.

Clients have now the option to hire remote workers from anywhere so for a Jobseeker its important to introspect and see how they can become better and have the skills and technologies to meet client requirements.

We at Synergisticit understand the problem of the mismatch between employer's requirements and Employee skills and that's why since 2010 we have helped thousands of candidates get jobs at technology clients like apple, google, Paypal, western union, Client, visa, walmart labs etc to name a few.

We have an excellent reputation with the clients. Currently, We are looking for entry-level software programmers, Java Full stack developers, Python/Java developers, Data analysts/ Data Scientists, Machine Learning engineers for full time positions with clients.

Twitch is the world’s biggest live streaming service, with global communities built around gaming, entertainment, music, sports, cooking, and more. It is where thousands of communities come together for whatever, every day.

We’re about community, inside and out. You’ll find coworkers who are eager to team up, collaborate, and smash (or elegantly solve) problems together. We’re on a quest to empower live communities, so if this sounds good to you, see what we’re up to on LinkedIn and Twitter, and discover the projects we’re solving on our Blog. Be sure to explore our Interviewing Guide to learn how to ace our interview process.

About The Team

The Community Discovery Machine Learning (CDML) team powers the systems that help millions of active viewers find the creators and communities they'll enjoy most. Powering the home page recommendations, browse, search, and feed ranking experiences, this team and its algorithms are at the heart of enabling the connections that make Twitch a great place for so many users.

About The Role

Data is critical to the algorithms that power the recommendation, search, and ranking systems. It's also critical to making decisions, especially working on systems that are themselves data-driven. As a Senior Data Scientist on the CDML team, you'll be responsible for helping drive improvements to the machine learning systems as well as analytics to drive decision-making.

While there is a team of Applied Scientists building and shipping the algorithms themselves, data science can help improve these systems directly. In this role, you can identify and build new signals to input into the models. We're also working on the value model that the algorithm optimizes, and your input will be critical to understanding the tradeoffs and balancing multiple objectives in a scientific way.

We also still have big unanswered analytics questions to solve. How often do viewers just want to get to the content they already know they want to watch, and when are they open to exploring new channels? These are the sorts of questions you'll be tackling.

You can work in San Francisco, CA; New York, NY; or Seattle, WA.

You Will:



Inform product strategies by defining and updating core metrics for each initiative
Estimate the opportunity sizing of new features the team could take on
Identify and build new signals to incorporate into the algorithms driving recommendations, search, and feed ranking at Twitch
Identify metric tradeoff ratios that help inform value model choices, long-term impact from early-growth-funnel users, and other product decisions
Establish analytical framework for your team: ad-hoc analysis, automated dashboards, and self-service reporting tools to surface key data to stakeholders
Design A/B experiments to drive product direction with iterative innovation and measurement
Work hand-in-hand with business, product, engineering, and design to proactively influence and inform teammates' decisions throughout the product life cycle
Distill ambiguous product or business questions, find clever ways to answer them, and to quantify the uncertainty



You Have:



BA/BS in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or equivalent industry experience
5+ years of experience as a data scientist or data analyst in a high velocity, data-driven environment
5+ years of machine learning/statistical modeling data analysis tools and techniques, and parameters that affect their performance experience
Expert SQL skills and proficiency in Python/R
Experience using data to create insight, drive business decisions and influence leadership



Bonus Points



MS/MA or higher in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related technical field
Experience working on algorithms powering large-scale consumer services
Experience in a data science team working on customer software products, analytics, and insights
Experience working with software development and operational event data
Familiarity with Twitch, either as a viewer or creator (or both!)



Perks



Medical, Dental, Vision & Disability Insurance
401(k)
Maternity & Parental Leave
Flexible PTO
Amazon Employee Discount



We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at Twitch. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.
