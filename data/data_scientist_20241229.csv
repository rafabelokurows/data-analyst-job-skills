Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for fresh graduates who meet the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience communicating and collaborating with multidisciplinary stakeholders in a team environment
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects
Ability to learn new systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, San Francisco Bay Area, or New York City. We are hiring these positions in Chicago, IL or Toronto, Ontario, Canada.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few roles based in offices. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder led, profitable and growing.

We are hiring an MLOps Field Engineer to help global companies embrace AI/ML in their business, using the latest open source capabilities on public and private cloud infrastructure, Linux and Kubernetes. Our team applies expert insights to real-world customer problems, enabling the enterprise adoption of Ubuntu, Kubeflow, MLFlow, Feast, DVC and related analytics, machine learning and data technologies. We are working to create the world's best open source data platform, covering traditional SQL databases and today's NoSQL data stores, as well as the machinery which turns data into insights and executable models.

The people who love this role are MLOps engineers who enjoy customer conversations and solving customer problems during the presales cycle. They are solutions architects who like to solve customer problems through architecture, presentations and training. This role is highly focused on designing ML architectures for external customers. It is not a software development role.

This role is particularly suited to candidates with a technical background who are business minded and driven by commercial success. This role is on our global Field Engineering team and will work closely with enterprise sales leads. We are specifically looking for people interested in solving the most difficult problems in modern data architectures. Training LLMs on multiple K8s clusters deployed on a hybrid cloud infrastructure with GPU sharing across multiple teams? Processing 10M events in real time for financial transactions? Object detection on 10k parallel 4K video streams? These are the problems we solve day to day.

Location: Most of our colleagues work from home. We are growing teams in EMEA, Americas and APAC time zones, so can accommodate candidates from almost any country.

What your day will look like

The global Field Engineering team members are Linux and cloud solutions architects for our customers, designing private and public cloud solutions fitting their workload needs. They are the cloud consultants who work hands-on with the technologies by deploying, testing and handing over the solution to our support or managed services team at the end of a project. They are also software engineers who use Python to develop Kubernetes operators and Linux open source infrastructure-as-code.


Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Architect cloud infrastructure solutions like Kubernetes, Kubeflow, OpenStack, and Spark
Deliver solutions either on-premise or in public cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
Collect customer business requirements and advise them on Ubuntu and relevant open source applications
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with the company values
Deliver presentations and demonstrations of Ubuntu Pro and AI/ML capabilities to prospective and current clients
Liaise with product teams to give them feedback on requirements to influence roadmap
Work collaboratively with your sales team to reach our common targets
Global travel up to 30% of time for internal, external events and customer meetings


What we are looking for in you


Exceptional academic track record from both high school and university
Undergraduate degree in a technical subject or a compelling narrative about your alternative chosen path
Experience in data engineering, MLOps, or big data solutions deployment
Experience with a relevant programming language, like Python, R, or Rust.
Confidence to respectfully speak up, exchange feedback, and share ideas without hesitation
Track record of going above-and-beyond expectations to achieve outstanding results
Demonstrated personal interest in continuous learning and development
Practical knowledge of Linux, virtualisation, containers and networking
Business-minded technology thinker and problem solver
Knowledge of cloud computing concepts & leaders, such as Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP
Interest in large-scale enterprise open source - private clouds, machine learning and AI, data and analytics
Intermediate level Python programming skills
Passion for technology evidenced by personal projects and initiatives
The work ethic and confidence to shine alongside motivated colleagues
Professional written and spoken English with excellent presentation skills
Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)
Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability
A dynamic person who loves to jump in new projects and interact with people
Appreciative of diversity, polite and effective in a multi-cultural, multi-national organisation
Thoughtfulness and self-motivation
Result-oriented, with a personal drive to follow up and meet commitments
Ability to travel internationally, for company events up to two weeks long, and customer or industry meetings


What you'll learn


Architect and deploy AI/ML infrastructures, data processing pipelines and multi-cluster distributed training
Wide range of open source applications and skills
Work directly with customers in a range of different businesses
Real-life and hands-on exposure to a wide range of emerging technologies and tools


What we offer colleagues

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus or commission. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.


Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person
Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
