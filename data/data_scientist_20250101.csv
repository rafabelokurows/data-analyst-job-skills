Som un hospital d'alta especialització i tecnologia, de referència en l'assistència, la docència i la recerca. El nostre model assistencial compagina harmònicament la ciència, els avenços tècnics i la humanització, des del respecte a la dignitat de la persona. Anualment ens visiten més de 350.000 pacients.

L’hospital, com a centre de referència internacional, aposta per una assistència i tractament del pacient humanista que te en compte l’experiència del pacient en tots els àmbits del tractament. Al ser un centre d’alta especialització, també integra les últimes tecnologies en el tractament i seguiment dels pacients. Un exemple és el projecte Hospital Líquid, el projecte de transformació digital que inicià el 2009 i que se centra en generar les eines i plataformes que permetin anar més enllà de les parets de l’hospital per tractar als pacients allà on siguin i empoderar-los en el procés de tractament. En el projecte PHEMS desenvoluparem i validarem un concepte d'ecosistema de dades de salut descentralitzat i obert, basat en estàndard (com el OMOP) i generat sobre 3 casos d’ús clínic de 4 hospital de referència en l’assistència pediàtrica a Europa. El projecte facilitarà l'accés a les dades de salut i ajudarà a avançar en l'anàlisi avançat de dades de federades,creant serveis que generen conjunts de dades sintètiques compartibles.

El projecte PHEMS ha estat finançat per la Comissió Europea dins del programa Horizon Europe (Research and Innovation Action) i sota el grant agreement nº 101094195.

Els socis tècnics, en col·laboració amb els socis hospitalaris (HUS - Helsinki, GOSH -Londres, ERASMUS-Rotterdam y HSJD-Barcelona) desenvoluparan tres casos d'ús clínic, que utilitzaran diversos tipus de dades (per exemple, dades d'EHR, de laboratori i de monitoratge):


Benchmarking del tractament de pacients de cardiologia amb cardiopatia congènita: Aquesta patologies són de les més complexes i costoses pel sistemes de salud, suposant tractament quirúrgics, estàncies en UCIs i seguiments a domicili. En aquest cas d’ús es crearà un dashboard per comparar les mesures de resultats dels pacients amb cardiologia mitjançant l'ús de dades federades i estandarditzades (OMOP) de GOSH, HUS, FSJD i ERASMUS. Aquestes dades de benchmarking s'utilitzaran per identificar les millors pràctiques en les vies de tractament per millorar l'atenció i la prestació assistencial dels pacients amb cardiopatia congènita.
Predicció de Sèpsia de la Unitat de Cures Intensives Pediàtriques (UCIP): El cas d'ús clínic 2 investigarà els beneficis de l'ecosistema federat PHEMS per desenvolupar, entrenar i provar algorismes que prediuen la sèpsia en UCIP de quatre grans hospitals infantils europeus (HUS, GOSH, ERASMUS y HSJD). Validar i implementar algorismes predictius de sèpsia aplicant tècniques d'aprenentatge automàtic per agrupar trajectòries de pacients de UCIP segons els resultats.
Hematologia; hemofília: El cas d'ús clínic 3 desenvoluparà i provarà un algorisme de predicció basat en Machine Learning en conjunts de dades de GOSH, HUS, FSJD i ERASMUS per tractar pacients pediàtrics amb hemofília A o B. Aquest cas d'ús pretén mostrar que l'ecosistema d'intercanvi de dades de nova creació, mitjançant algorismes d'aprenentatge federats, augmenta el nombre de pacients inclosos en algorismes d'aprenentatge automàtic en malalties de baixa incidència. Millorarem la precisió d'un algorisme d'aprenentatge automàtic creat per un únic centre (ERASMUS) per predir els nivells de factor plasmàtic a l'hemofília A i B ampliant la validació als altres 3 centres. També millorarem els models de farmacocinètica (PK) existents per predir els nivells de factor plasmàtic. Finalment, compararem el rendiment dels models d'aprenentatge automàtic amb els models clàssics de PK per predir els nivells de factor plasmàtic.



L'objectiu d'aquest lloc de treball és incorporar un/a data scientist a l’equip multidisciplinar del projecte per donar suport transversal als tres casos d’ús clínics en què el HSJD participa. Però especialment en el desenvolupament del algoritme de predicció de Sepsis en UCIP.

EL PROJECTE A DESENVOLUPAR:

Donar suport al projecte PHEMS com a referent bioinformàtic en la preparació de les bases de dades dels 3 casos de us i en el desenvolupament e implementació de models predictius de SEPSIS en UCIP, coordinat amb els 4 hospitals de referència pediàtrics.

It houses MareNostrum, one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe, was a founding and hosting member of the former European HPC infrastructure PRACE (Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe), and is now hosting entity for EuroHPC JU, the Joint Undertaking that leads large-scale investments and HPC provision in Europe. The mission of BSC is to research, develop and manage information technologies in order to facilitate scientific progress. BSC combines HPC service provision and R&D into both computer and computational science (life, earth and engineering sciences) under one roof, and currently has over 1000 staff from 60 countries.

We are particularly interested for this role in the strengths and lived experiences of women and underrepresented groups to help us avoid perpetuating biases and oversights in science and IT research. In instances of equal merit, the incorporation of the under-represented sex will be favoured.

We promote Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, fostering an environment where each and every one of us is appreciated for who we are, regardless of our differences.

Context And Mission The Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (INB) was created in 2003 with the mission to support bioinformatics activities across the country. Since then, it has evolved to keep up with emerging needs - especially in the field of creating, maintaining and extending technological infrastructures that facilitate research activities in the broad domain of Life Sciences. Since 2017, the INB is the Spanish Node of ELIXIR (ELIXIR-ES), the pan-European Research Infrastructure for the management of research data and other digital assets in Life Sciences across 22 national members and 3 observers.

Both the INB Technical Coordination Hub and the INB Computational Node, part of the Life Sciences Department at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC-CNS), participate and lead different local, national and international - mainly European - projects related to research data and software management as well as to the set-up of virtual research environments where data and software can be utilised.

As part of the EU-funded ELIXIR-EXCELERATE project, both teams started the development of OpenEBench, the ELIXIR open data platform to support both the technical monitoring of research software - including workflows - and the scientific benchmarking activities led by research communities. Since its inception, OpenEBench has grown to monitor more than 43,000 individual research software entries and support more than 16 different research communities at different maturation stages, including the participation of different funded projects like EUCanImage, EUCAIM, DataTools4Heart, VEIS among others.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a field has experienced accelerated growth over the past years with many applications having a great impact on the general population, including the use of AI/ML models to support decision-making processes in clinical applications. However, limited efforts have been put to understand and validate AI/ML models in terms of both the data and software used to train and refine them. Thus, the INB teams are seeking a research software engineer to develop methodologies for carrying out systematic evaluation and validation efforts in the context of OpenEBench and connected with ongoing projects, e.g. EUCAIM, and others to come. The objective is to develop strategies and methodologies that can be utilised by the different research communities working with OpenEBench to understand the potential biases present in the input data and limitations of the generated AI/ML models. Such a generalization should contribute to foster broader discussions among the different communities leading to the iterative refinement process of it.

The funding for these actions/fellowships and contracts comes from the European Union Recovery and Resilience Facility - Next Generation, within the framework of the General Invitation by the public business entity Red.es to participate in the talent attraction and retention programs within Investment 4 of Component 19 of the Recovery, Transformation, and Resilience Plan. For more information, please check: here.

Key Duties Landscape the current efforts on AI/ML models evaluation and validation in Life Sciences and work towards the integration into the exciting fora. Lead the development of strategies and a generalizable methodology for AI/ML models evaluation and validation in close collaboration with various research communities and relevant projects.
