Je maakt statistische modellen voor onze verschillende retailmerken. Het resultaat van jouw werk: een nog betere dienstverlening op maat van onze klanten.




Wat doe je concreet?




In de divisie Data & Analytics werk je in multidisciplinair team bestaand uit data science engineers, bi engineers, business analysts, … Samen bieden jullie analytische oplossingen aan voor de verschillende Colruyt Group merken, zoals Colruyt, Okay, Bike-Republic of Jims. In het data science kennisgroep worden ervaringen en kennis uitgewisseld. Op deze manier blijf je bijleren.
Als data scientist werk je samen met complementaire collega’s aan een brede waaier van projecten waarbij je in aanraking komt met nieuwe technieken en technologieën. We moedigen je ook aan om zelf, in overleg met het team, op zoek te gaan naar nieuwe methoden en technieken en zo de kennis en skills van de groep te vergroten. Naast een heel ruim aanbod aan interne opleidingen krijg je ook de kans om aanvullende opleidingstrajecten te volgen. Op die manier bouw je continu aan je business-kennis, je technische skills en je sociale vaardigheden.
Met het team focussen we enerzijds op onze interne klanten, de business-partners. We vertalen hun vragen in analytische projecten die we aanpakken in multidisciplinaire teams. Dat resulteert in een directe en nauwe samenwerking met ETL, software development en de businesspartner.
Anderzijds zijn we ook verantwoordelijk voor de identificatie van nieuwe analytics-opportuniteiten. We gaan proactief op zoek naar nieuwe inzichten die een toegevoegde waarde creëren voor onze partners. Daarbij kijken we uiteraard niet alleen naar Colruyt Group, maar volgen we ook de externe trends op het vlak van use cases rond analytics en technologische innovatie.
Colruyt Group bestaat uit veel verschillende entiteiten. Dat zorgt voor een enorme variatie en hoeveelheid aan data én use cases. De projecten waar je aan meewerkt gaan dan ook van klantensegmentatie over verkoopsprognose en analyse van winkeltesten tot operationele efficiëntie van machines, predictive maintenance en optimaal gebruik van grondstoffen.

Iemand die samen met ons wil groeien!




ACA’s Innovation Lab is het nieuwe businessconcept van ACA Group. In ons Innovation Lab groeien innovatieve ideeën uit tot gevalideerde businessconcepten.




Hoe wij (samen)werken

Omdat wij een relatief nieuw team zijn, hanteren we geen ‘business-as-usual’ proces. We werken in een dynamische omgeving die eigenlijk vergelijkbaar is met een start-up binnen een groter geheel. ACA investeert een substantieel deel van haar winst in het “ACA Innovation Lab” zodat er ruimte is om nieuwe ideeën en technologieën af te toetsen.

We hebben bij ACA gekozen voor een proactieve aanpak om innovatie (AI en Machine Learning) bij onze klanten te stimuleren. Dit heeft ons de kans gegeven om samen met onze klanten een aantal nieuwe oplossingen te ontwikkelen door het gebruik van AI en ML.




Waar jij mee aan zal werken (tech & omgeving)

Python & Java
Kubernetes & Kubeflow
AWS / GCP
Jupyter notebooks
Git
Tensorflow
Machine Vision toolkits (YOLO, OpenCV, …)
Wandb
MLFlow




Ben jij de geknipte persoon voor deze rol?

Hard skills

Je hebt minstens 3 jaar relevante ervaring met Machine Learning.
Je hebt ervaring als tech lead in een nieuwe start-up omgeving.
Je hebt een goede kennis van het Engels en/of Nederlands.
Je hebt een goede kennis van software development.
Je flexibel kunnen opstellen in een dynamische werkomgeving. Prioriteiten stellen vormen voor jou dan ook geen probleem.
Ervaring in een test-driven development en Agile omgeving.




Soft skills

Je bezit goede communicatieve vaardigheden.
Je bent een teamplayer, maar je gaat ook graag zelfstandig tewerk.
Je bent proactief ingesteld en gemotiveerd om nieuwe uitdagingen aan te gaan!




Hoe voelt dat, werken bij ACA?

Innovatieve werkomgeving: je werkt met de nieuwste technologie en tools in een omgeving die innovatie uitademt.
Een aantrekkelijk loon, een bedrijfswagen, maaltijdcheques, onkostenvergoeding, MacBook Pro en nog veel meer.
Leren & groeien: bij ACA heeft iedereen een on-the-job coach. Je beschikt over een persoonlijk evolutieplan met een budget voor technische en professionele trainingen en heel wat kansen om bij te leren.
We’ve got your back: we voorzien een uitgebreid gezondheids- en verzekeringsplan om tegemoet te komen aan jouw noden. Het is onze prioriteit om ervoor te zorgen dat onze collega’s gelukkig zijn, o.a. door een goede work-life balans, de juiste tools te voorzien, enzovoort.
Onze unieke bedrijfscultuur: je bent deel van een passioneel en hardwerkend team dat trots is op hun verwezenlijkingen. ACA is een plek waar teamwork, transparantie, kennisdeling en erkenning centraal staan. Trots om ons ""Great Place To Work"" te noemen!
Jij staat centraal: wij zijn gedreven door onze teamleden waarbij iedereen hun steentje bijdraagt, maar waar plaats is voor heel wat fun. Een fantastisch team werkt niet alleen samen, maar maakt ook samen plezier. Daarom organiseren we heel wat activiteiten binnen en buiten onze kantoren en vertrekken we elk jaar op een spetterend ACA-weekend!

Smartcat is on a mission to become the wall-to-wall Language AI platform, addressing the diverse needs in multilingual content for various user personas within global enterprises.

Smartcat is uniquely positioned within the $100+ billion multilingual content industry, which is currently served by tens of thousands of agencies. This results in a highly fragmented and inefficient supply chain, high costs, unacceptable turnaround times, and quality issues. Using highly qualified internal resources to translate or create multilingual content (insourcing) solves the quality problem for enterprises, but if done manually, it can't solve for scalability, high cost, and slow turnaround.

Smartcat changes the ROI equation in favor of insourcing with its Language AI platform for enterprise end-users. It delivers high-quality, instantaneous AI translations or generates new content in any language by tapping into a customer-specific multilingual content library. The AI output is further refined through human editing by the client's internal reviewers or experts from the Smartcat's embedded global marketplace of linguists and content editors. This AI output continuously improves through the editing feedback loop, ensuring consistent and customer-tailored results.

More than 1,000 global companies including ~20% of the Fortune 1,000 trust Smartcat to communicate their innovations and ideas all over the world.

As a dynamic Series C company, Smartcat is growing at 130% YoY, thanks to the high and quick ROI it delivers to global enterprises. It's well-funded by notable VCs, and is capital efficient, offering a unique blend of hyper-growth potential with downside protection and the capacity for long-term planning and strategy.

Это самый удобный и быстрый способ пожертвовать деньги в пользу некоммерческого фонда. Мы изобретаем способы ускорить загрузку, увеличить конверсию, принять оплату разными способами и т.д. Каждый месяц люди со всего мира донатят десятки миллионов долларов через нашу платформу.

Крупнейшие некоммерческие организации мира используют наше решение чтобы собирать деньги. Например, UNICEF, самый известный международный фонд ООН, делает весь онлайн-фандрайзинг на нашей платформе. Аналогично поступают Барак Обама, Ассоциация изучения Альцгеймера и многие другие. Наш рейтинг на самой популярной платформе для отзывов — 4.9 из 5.

Мы работаем в энтерпрайз-сегменте. Наши клиенты находятся по всему миру, но основная концентрация приходится на США, Канаду, Великобританию и Австралию.




Продукт

Продукт, который мы делаем — большой и сложный. Он состоит из нескольких частей: чекаут и виджеты (каждый из них, это небольшое SPA), порталы для донора, организации и партнеров, админка и еще несколько приложений.




Команда

В компании работает 180 человек. В офисе в Нью-Йорке маркетинг, продажи, онбординг и саппорт. Удаленно мы принимаем продуктовые решения, делаем дизайн и разработку.

Продуктовая команда маленькая и в этом кайф — у нас нет «незначительных» задач. Все что мы делаем — важно. Команда сильная и в этом отдельный кайф — всегда интересно быть в окружении крутых людей, которые делятся опытом.




Кого ищем




Есть опыт решения задач в одной и более областей из:

RecSys;
Ulift modeling;
Churn prediction;
LTV prediction;
Forecasting.




Умение проводить A/B тестирование моделей в production;

Владение MLOps инструментами для сервинга и мониторинга моделей;

Хорошее знание SQL;

Уровень английского языка не ниже Intermediate.

Супер-важно уметь соблюдать все виды договоренностей.




Пара важных вещей

Позиция предполагает релокацию из РФ и РБ. При желании вы можете воспользоваться нашей программой релокации, которая распространяется на Европу, Сербию и Грузию.
Мы работаем удаленно, но с 9 до 18 часов по CET. В это время мы интенсивно созваниваемся и много обсуждаем.




Формальный список того, что нужно делать

Полный цикл обработки данных (EDA, сбор и очистка данных, feature engineering и т.д.),
Решение задач регрессии, кластеризации, классификации,
Разработка и реализация моделей машинного обучения,
Доведение моделей до Production.




Зачем мы вам

Мы строим сильную команду людей с горящими глазами. У каждого свой опыт, которым он охотно делится.
У нас нет ветвистой иерархии, все люди доступны на расстоянии zoom-звонка. В компании открыта почти вся финансовая статистика, мы регулярно рассказываем как устроен продукт, продажи, саппорт, откуда появляются клиенты и деньги, что интересного случилось и т.д.
Мы верим в долгие отношения и выдаем разработчикам сток-опции. Компания хорошо растет — только за прошлый год мы вырастили метрики в два раза.




Бонусы

Нам важно чтобы работая удаленно, вы чувствовали себя комфортно. Обычно мы отправляем сотрудникам Macbook и нужное число мониторов. Если ваше рабочее место не обустроено, то пришлем стол, удобное кресло и все что нужно для продуктивной работы.

Полностью оплачиваем необходимое ПО, книги и коворкинг, если не хотите работать из дома. Помогаем с оплатой спортзала и бассейна, курсов английского и любого профильного образования.




Раз в год собираемся всей командой в оффлайне. В 2021 мы арендовали огромную виллу на Кипре, в 2022 встречались в отеле под Тбилиси, а в 2023 устроили недельный выезд на 60 человек на курорт в Турции. В следующем году будет что-то новое :-)

Мы делаем фандрайзинговую платформу Fundraise Up. Это самый удобный и быстрый способ пожертвовать деньги в пользу некоммерческого фонда. Мы изобретаем способы ускорить загрузку, увеличить конверсию, принять оплату разными способами и т.д. Каждый месяц люди со всего мира донатят десятки миллионов долларов через нашу платформу.

Крупнейшие некоммерческие организации мира используют наше решение чтобы собирать деньги. Например, UNICEF, самый известный международный фонд ООН, делает весь онлайн-фандрайзинг на нашей платформе. Аналогично поступают Барак Обама, Ассоциация изучения Альцгеймера и многие другие. Наш рейтинг на самой популярной платформе для отзывов — 4.9 из 5.

Мы работаем в энтерпрайз-сегменте. Наши клиенты находятся по всему миру, но основная концентрация приходится на США, Канаду, Великобританию и Австралию.




Продукт




Продукт, который мы делаем — большой и сложный. Он состоит из нескольких частей: чекаут и виджеты (каждый из них, это небольшое SPA), порталы для донора, организации и партнеров, админка и еще несколько приложений.




Команда




В компании работает 200 человек. В офисе в Нью-Йорке маркетинг, продажи, онбординг и саппорт. Удаленно мы принимаем продуктовые решения, делаем дизайн и разработку.

Продуктовая команда маленькая и в этом кайф — у нас нет «незначительных» задач. Все что мы делаем — важно. Команда сильная и в этом отдельный кайф — всегда интересно быть в окружении крутых людей, которые делятся опытом.




Ожидания от кандидата




Мы ищем тимлида, который залидит команду из 2 DS-ов и возьмет на себя ключевую роль в развитии и улучшении текущих процессов в ML команде. Вам предстоит анализировать существующие решения, выявлять возможности для оптимизации и внедрять новые подходы и технологии. Ваша роль будет включать активное взаимодействие с различными стейкхолдерами (в первую очередь, с техническими командами), внедрение практик и написание документации по проектам и процессам.




Кого ищем




Опыт работы в области дата саенс, разработки или инженерии от 5 лет.
Опыт в построении команд, и работы с ней (проведении 1:1 встреч, предоставлении конструктивных фидбеков, разрешении конфликтов) и постановка задач команде.
Уверенные знания в области анализа данных, статистики, машинного обучения и работы с большими данными (ключевые термины - “RecSys”, “Uplift modeling”, “Churn prediction”, “LTV prediction”, “Forecasting”).
Опыт работы с MLOps практиками (Experiment Tracking, Model Registry, Feature Store, auto-retraining, Online serving, Models monitoring).
Опыт построения и оптимизации рабочих процессов, включая процессы CI/CD, автоматизации тестирования, развертывания моделей.
Опыт взаимодействия с мультифункциональными командами и понимание потребностей бизнеса.




Супер-важно уметь соблюдать все виды договоренностей.




Пара важных вещей




Позиция предполагает релокацию. При желании вы можете воспользоваться нашей программой релокации, которая распространяется на Европу, Сербию и Грузию.
Мы работаем удаленно, но с 9 до 18 часов по CET. В это время мы интенсивно созваниваемся и много обсуждаем.
Итоговая сумма компенсации будет зависеть от вашего опыта, результатов тестового задания и технического интервью, а так же вашей страны проживания.




Зачем мы вам




Мы строим сильную команду людей с горящими глазами. У каждого свой опыт, которым он охотно делится.
У нас нет ветвистой иерархии, все люди доступны на расстоянии zoom-звонка. В компании открыта почти вся финансовая статистика, мы регулярно рассказываем как устроен продукт, продажи, саппорт, откуда появляются клиенты и деньги, что интересного случилось и т.д.
Мы верим в долгие отношения и выдаем разработчикам сток-опции. Компания хорошо растет — только за прошлый год мы вырастили метрики в два раза.




Бонусы




Нам важно чтобы работая удаленно, вы чувствовали себя комфортно. Обычно мы отправляем сотрудникам Macbook и нужное число мониторов. Если ваше рабочее место не обустроено, то пришлем стол, удобное кресло и все что нужно для продуктивной работы.

Полностью оплачиваем необходимое ПО, книги и коворкинг, если не хотите работать из дома. Помогаем с оплатой спортзала и бассейна, курсов английского и любого профильного образования.

Раз в год собираемся всей командой в оффлайне. В 2021 мы арендовали огромную виллу на Кипре, в 2022 встречались в отеле под Тбилиси, а в 2023 устроили недельный выезд на 60 человек на курорт в Турции. В следующем году будет что-то новое :-)

Along this journey, we also draw strength from diverse experiences and opinions to grow together, fail quickly, learn, and adjust the course to create solutions that deliver even better results.
