We are here to win - not just to take part. Just like our clients who operate at the elite level of sport, we understand that in order to win; we need to put in the work. This means going the extra mile, being willing to do what others will not and holding ourselves to a higher standard. Some companies play to not lose, we play to win. We are proactive, decisive and have the courage to take risks.

We pay it forward - we are always helpful. To customers, to partners and most importantly to each other. Not because it will ‘pay back', because it's the right thing to do.

We are adaptable - we understand in a world that is changing faster than ever before - the only constant is change. The average lifespan of a Fortune 100 company in 1958 was 61 years, now it is 18 years. We adapt to a changing world, constantly iterating, moving forward and staying relevant.

Impossible is an opinion - we are on a mission to build something which has never been done before from the ground up. It will be a hard journey full of challenges which are currently unsolved. Our culture is defined by the fact that when we are confronted with challenges, we work from the assumption that it is possible to overcome them.

We are transparent - we challenge each other. Regardless of title, seniority or reporting lines. We give feedback and we are hungry to receive it. We value honest feedback delivered with kindness, and we value people who ask questions.

We always trust, respect and care for each other - it's no easy feat working in a startup, let alone one with goals as ambitious as ours. At sequel we believe no one is ever too busy to support fellow team members and that we should always be helpful, inclusive and selfless in the way we work. Diversity of background and thought is celebrated as we respect and appreciate what makes us all different. We don't tolerate free riders, egos or workplace politics.

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

More About Carbon Re

We don’t draw a specific line between engineering and research teams. We operate as one cohesive unit, sharing tech stack, knowledge, and objectives. Our focus spans fundamental ML research to commercial-grade software development, offering diverse learning and impact opportunities.

Immediate action for long-term impact. Due to the cumulative https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing#IPCC_usage effect, one tonne of carbon saved today will help us meet global temperature targets as much as two tonnes saved in 2050. Immediate carbon reduction has a more profound effect on global temperature goals than future efforts. Our solutions prioritize immediate operational improvements for significant climate impact. We understand the urgency of now.

We value diversity, equity, and inclusivity. With a diverse range of nationalities and a range of backgrounds represented in our small team, we are building an inclusive environment where our people can bring their authentic selves to work, be respected for who they are and the exceptional work they do. We welcome and actively encourage applications from all sections of society and are committed to offering equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, disability, age, citizenship, or any other basis. We see our diversity as an asset as we tackle challenging problems through technology.

This is an exciting opportunity to use your data science skills for the public good and join the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) as a data scientist within its Data, Technology and Insights Directorate. The directorate is a multidisciplinary team that brings together data scientists, data engineers, technologists, behavioural scientists and digital forensics and eDiscovery experts. It provides the CMA with specialist skills and capabilities to keep pace with fast-moving digital markets, rapidly developing business models and the growing use of data and algorithms.




The CMA is a world-leading competition authority at the forefront of tackling pressing public policy questions, including the regulation of the biggest digital markets. Our mission is to make markets work well in the interests of consumers, businesses, and the economy.




The data science and engineering team




You will join an established team of approximately 20 data scientists and data engineers within the wider DaTA Unit. We provide analytical support for CMA legal cases and develop tools to improve how the CMA operates. We build most of our tools ourselves, on top of open-source software, using our custom analysis platform built in AWS. Data scientists in our team have space to explore the use of new, cutting-edge techniques in data processing and machine learning, including large language models and generative AI. We work in a collaborative way, with a focus on sharing our knowledge and experience across the team.

Building a machine learning tool that collects and classifies news articles to support the CMA’s merger investigation team.
Experimenting with and testing LLMs as part of our digital transformation strategy.
Using web-scraped data to run a causal study to determine the features in a tech platform’s ranking algorithm.




The role




As a Data Scientist, your key responsibilities will include:




The technical delivery of data science and analysis to support CMA legal cases, with guidance from senior team members
The development of data science tools to support the functions of the CMA
Producing high quality “production” code in Python (other languages such as R or SQL might be used as needed)
Carrying out regular reviews of code written by other team members
Writing and presenting the output of analyses to technical and non-technical audiences
Contributing to scoping projects and designing their data science solutions, as well as team planning sessions, retrospectives and training
Identifying competition and consumer protection issues that CMA could address using data science methods
Working with multi-disciplinary case teams and developing strong working relationships with internal stakeholders across the CMA and its specialisms




What we’re looking for




We are looking for data scientists that are passionate about using their technical skills to help ensure that markets work well, and that consumers are treated fairly. Successful candidates will have a strong interest in using data science in a multi-disciplinary context, working together with other technical specialists at the CMA, such as economists, behavioural scientists, and lawyers.




The successful candidates will have:




A degree in a quantitative subject or equivalent experience working in data science.
Experience delivering data science projects as part of a team and experience of shaping and leading analytical projects.
Strong knowledge of modern machine learning methods and tools, as well as data extraction and manipulation (knowledge of data engineering tools and techniques, such as cloud services and git version control is a plus).
Substantial ability and experience of coding in Python and/or R.
Good communication skills, with the ability to write reports for a non-technical audience and to present analysis in a straightforward and engaging way.
Experience of working collaboratively with stakeholders, building excellent working relationships.




What we can offer you




The CMA is a hugely diverse, rewarding and stimulating place to work – an opportunity to work for the public good and to stretch and develop yourself in doing so. We offer generous benefits, including an excellent pension scheme with an average employer contribution of 28%, at least 25 days leave (increasing to 30 over five years), and generous maternity/paternity leave provision. You can also take advantage of interest-free season ticket loans, a cycle to work scheme, our employee assistance programme, and our extensive flexible working options.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.




Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.




Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.




As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is to maximise business impact within one of many business areas. You will help answer questions like:





Which markets/cities should we enter next?


How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?


What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?


How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?


What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?


How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?


What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?


How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?





The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.




Requirements





A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)


Experience conducting A/B experiments


Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences


A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset


Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems


A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail


A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact


Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems

We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.




Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.

Which markets/cities should we enter next?


How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?


What is the business impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?


Can the Delivery food market sustain multiple players?


What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?


What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants?


What impact do online reviews have?


How will a change in the user interface affect customer choice behaviour?





The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.


Requirements:



Masters Degree or PhD in Economics or Econometrics (preferred)


Always curious and willing to learn new skills


A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset


Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business-relevant economic problems


A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail


Proficiency with analytical tools like R/Python and familiarity with SQL


Ideally industry experience since the completion of your academic career


Excellent people skills — you’ll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into economic problems





At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. The scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.




Why DeliverooOur mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.




We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




DiversityAt Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$140,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$140,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

To do this, we start with our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization.

Data Science is at the heart of Lyft’s products and decision-making. You will leverage data and rigorous, analytical thinking to shape our products and make business decisions. This will involve identifying and scoping opportunities, shaping team priorities, recommending and implementing technical solutions, designing experiments, and measuring the impact of new features.

The Verticals team encompasses 3 critical and unique products / marketplaces within Lyft: airports, scheduled rides, and events. Airports are one of the most important, impactful, and complex parts of Lyft’s Rideshare business, as they are a key part of both the rider and driver Lyft experiences and have unique considerations and dynamics. Scheduled rides allow riders to book a ride in advance with high reliability, and enable drivers to add structure to their work schedule. Lastly, events such as concerts or sporting games require similar considerations of special operations to ensure a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.

As a Data Scientist on the Verticals team, you will collaborate with engineering, product, design, and operations to think critically about the current rider and driver experience and implement product enhancements to facilitate market growth. The ideal candidate can apply strong business acumen to propose product changes, develop end-to-end technical solutions, and is comfortable working with a highly cross functional team. In this role, you will help us tackle problems such as:


Are we able to forecast ride demand and implement driver guidance to ensure riders can rely on Lyft for an airport ride at all times of the day?

But that’s not all. Whether we’re leading real-time money movement, driving innovative commerce solutions like open payments for transit systems, or making advancements in new areas like verification and open banking, we are playing a key role in shaping the future of the digital economy in Canada.

Want to make a lasting impact amongst a community of creative thinkers, problem solvers, technical gurus and high-performance application developers? We want to hear from you.

The Data Scientist will be responsible for providing actionable insights for the fraud management practice. The main objective for this role will be to work with various fraud teams and other internal business partners, developing data science products (models, features, insights) to aid in fraud mitigation.

In this role, the Data Scientist will focus on fraud research and model development for new Interac products coming to market.

The Data Scientist will work with a variety of people to provide deliverables that include research insights, product design input, and data science assets (models, tables, visualizations, etc) that add value to the business. These assets will ultimately be used to ensure that Interac products are trusted, giving our both our business partners, and our end-user customers themselves, confidence that they can use any new Interac products safely. It is crucial that these deliverables provide solutions that are reproducible, well-documented, peer-reviewed, and version controlled.

Using a full-cycle data science approach, the Data Scientist will need to understand problems and surrounding context between fraud and the business need, formulate a hypothesis on how to solve these problems, and execute, providing status updates as needed. The resulting deliverables may be used directly by end-users in the team or result in requirements for features to incorporate into one of Interac’s production environments.

You reside in: Toronto or Ottawa

You'll be responsible for:


Collaborating with fraud product owners and software developers to enable deployment of fraud solutions that will scale across the company’s ecosystem.

Collaborating with business customers and fraud product owners to understand needs, recommend strategy enhancements, and deploy predictive analytics across multiple platforms.
Researching, developing, deploying and analyzing testing strategies to continuously improve current fraud related deliverables.
Preparing detailed documentation to transfer knowledge and satisfy governance and regulatory concerns.
Communicating technical fraud solutions to non-technical audiences.
Consulting on applying quantitative problem solving to business problems using analytics in both mentoring and classroom settings.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$140,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About The Senior Data Scientist Role

We are looking for a talented Data Scientist to help us develop and enhance our credit offerings. In this role, you'll work closely with product, engineering, and operations teams to analyze data, design models, and create solutions that empower our customers to manage their finances with greater confidence and efficiency.

Requirements

As a Senior Data Scientist at Float:


You'll develop a data strategy that is aligned to Float's strategy, identify key metrics, which data needs to be collected, and set the processes for how data will be stored, cleaned, and maintained at Float
Build and refine predictive models for credit scoring, risk assessment, and customer segmentation
Work closely with our Machine Learning team to deliver the most relevant and accurate financial services to our customers
Analyze customer data to develop insights that inform lending decisions and underwriting strategies
Design and optimize algorithms to automate credit approval processes and monitor portfolio performance
Develop tools and dashboards for tracking credit risk metrics and loan performance
Identify trends in customer behaviour and market conditions to improve credit products
Experiment with new methodologies and technologies to enhance underwriting accuracy and efficiency
You'll work closely with the product team to build data-led products
You'll evaluate the performance of existing models and propose enhancements to improve accuracy, efficiency, and scalability



Your impact will be:


Contribute to creating delightful and relevant financial services for Canadian businesses
Enable small businesses to access the credit they need to grow and scale
Help solve cash flow challenges by delivering smarter, faster credit solutions
Improve financial stability for small businesses by offering data-driven credit products tailored to their needs



A few must have experiences:


You've worked in Fintech, payments or lending
You understand the concepts of KYB, KYC, underwriting, risk modeling and scoring
A deep understanding of credit risk assessment and financial data analysis
Experience partnering with Machine Learning teams



You'll be great in this role if:


You're an owner. You love a challenge, and take great satisfaction in tackling them head on. You love being a pioneer and taking on any task (big or small) and driving it through to completion. You are also comfortable making independent decisions and following your instincts to be able to move quickly
You're able to explain complex data in simple terms. As you'll be communicating your findings to different stakeholders, your ability to present data in an understandable way is vital
You have solid technical skills. Strong skills in data modeling, data structures, data mining, predictive modeling and analysis tools (such as Python, SQL, DBT), and data visualization tools, are crucial. Understanding of machine learning algorithms and statistics is an asset
You understand the business context. You'll be more effective if you understand not just how to work with data, but also why you're working with it - i.e., how it will impact the business and drive decisions
You're comfortable with a fast-paced environment. Float is a dynamic environment and things can change quickly. You should be flexible and able to adapt to changes as they occur
You can balance attention to detail and strategic thinking. While it's important to delve into the details of your data, it's equally important to keep the big picture in mind
You ruthlessly prioritize. You will have multiple responsibilities and projects. Being able to effectively manage your workload and meet deadlines is crucial
You have an experimental mindset. The ability to design and analyze experiments will be very helpful in optimizing products and making business decisions
You're eager to continue your own learning. Scrappy and voracious, you want to know the ‘why' behind every answer. You love to have healthy debates with fellow developers and colleagues about the product



This role won't be a fit if:


You're not extremely detail oriented
You are not open to a hybrid role
You aren't a self-starter and don't like to work independently
You're not comfortable wearing multiple hats
You don't like change and adapting to new ways of doing things
You aren't comfortable with ambiguity
You aren't able to translate technical jargon into simple language
You lack patience for iterative work
You want detailed to-dos for your tasks and projects
You're not keen on learning new things
You don't have strong stakeholder management skills
You don't like regular feedback on your work


Don't meet every single requirement? If you're excited about this role, and you strongly align with our values but your past experience doesn't align perfectly, we encourage you to apply anyway. You may be the right candidate for this, or other future positions.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for fresh graduates who meet the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience communicating and collaborating with multidisciplinary stakeholders in a team environment
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.
