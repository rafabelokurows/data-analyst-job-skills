Twitch is the world’s biggest live streaming service, with global communities built around gaming, entertainment, music, sports, cooking, and more. It is where thousands of communities come together for whatever, every day.

We’re about community, inside and out. You’ll find coworkers who are eager to team up, collaborate, and smash (or elegantly solve) problems together. We’re on a quest to empower live communities, so if this sounds good to you, see what we’re up to on LinkedIn and Twitter, and discover the projects we’re solving on our Blog. Be sure to explore our Interviewing Guide to learn how to ace our interview process.

About The Team

The Community Discovery Machine Learning (CDML) team powers the systems that help millions of active viewers find the creators and communities they'll enjoy most. Powering the home page recommendations, browse, search, and feed ranking experiences, this team and its algorithms are at the heart of enabling the connections that make Twitch a great place for so many users.

About The Role

Data is critical to the algorithms that power the recommendation, search, and ranking systems. It's also critical to making decisions, especially working on systems that are themselves data-driven. As a Senior Data Scientist on the CDML team, you'll be responsible for helping drive improvements to the machine learning systems as well as analytics to drive decision-making.

While there is a team of Applied Scientists building and shipping the algorithms themselves, data science can help improve these systems directly. In this role, you can identify and build new signals to input into the models. We're also working on the value model that the algorithm optimizes, and your input will be critical to understanding the tradeoffs and balancing multiple objectives in a scientific way.

We also still have big unanswered analytics questions to solve. How often do viewers just want to get to the content they already know they want to watch, and when are they open to exploring new channels? These are the sorts of questions you'll be tackling.

You can work in San Francisco, CA; New York, NY; or Seattle, WA.

You Will:



Inform product strategies by defining and updating core metrics for each initiative
Estimate the opportunity sizing of new features the team could take on
Identify and build new signals to incorporate into the algorithms driving recommendations, search, and feed ranking at Twitch
Identify metric tradeoff ratios that help inform value model choices, long-term impact from early-growth-funnel users, and other product decisions
Establish analytical framework for your team: ad-hoc analysis, automated dashboards, and self-service reporting tools to surface key data to stakeholders
Design A/B experiments to drive product direction with iterative innovation and measurement
Work hand-in-hand with business, product, engineering, and design to proactively influence and inform teammates' decisions throughout the product life cycle
Distill ambiguous product or business questions, find clever ways to answer them, and to quantify the uncertainty



You Have:



BA/BS in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or equivalent industry experience
5+ years of experience as a data scientist or data analyst in a high velocity, data-driven environment
5+ years of machine learning/statistical modeling data analysis tools and techniques, and parameters that affect their performance experience
Expert SQL skills and proficiency in Python/R
Experience using data to create insight, drive business decisions and influence leadership



Bonus Points



MS/MA or higher in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related technical field
Experience working on algorithms powering large-scale consumer services
Experience in a data science team working on customer software products, analytics, and insights
Experience working with software development and operational event data
Familiarity with Twitch, either as a viewer or creator (or both!)



Perks



Medical, Dental, Vision & Disability Insurance
401(k)
Maternity & Parental Leave
Flexible PTO

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve

Strong knowledge of natural language processing techniques and tools
Experience with cloud platforms (e.g. AWS, GCP) for model deployment
Familiarity with database systems (e.g. PostgreSQL) and data integration pipelines
Respect for compliance and privacy requirements in healthcare (e.g. HIPAA)



Our Core Values


Ally is our favorite moniker
The most inclusive approach is worth the work
Celebrate measurable improvements in equity outcomes
Fearless advocates for diversity
Incentives matter to stakeholders choosing our products
Taking initiative is actually giving
We are accountable for the experience of patients and providers

As a Data Scientist at Kikoff, you work closely with cross functional teams incl. Product, Engineering, Data Engineering, Marketing, Operation. By applying your technical skills, analytical mindset, and product intuition, you will help our customers improve their financial security. You will use data to identify and solve product development’s biggest challenges. Your responsibilities includes:


Product leadership: use data to shape product development, quantify new opportunities, set goals, identify upcoming challenges, and ensure the products we build bring value to our customers.
Analytics: develop hypotheses and employ a diverse toolkit of rigorous analytical approaches, different methodologies, frameworks, and technical approaches to test them.
Communication and influence: convince and influence your partners by telling clear data stories.


Qualifications


Bachelors’ or above in quantitative discipline: Statistics, Applied Mathematics, Economics, Computer Science, Engineering, or related field
A minimum of 2 years of work experience in analytics
Expert knowledge of SQL and experience with Python
Deep understanding of statistical analysis, experimentation design, and common analytical techniques like regression, decision trees
Strong verbal and written communication skills
A humble collaborative can-do attitude and natural curiosity


What We’re Like


Scrappy. We had a product goal and put out the MVP, collecting our first users with steady growth via paid channels in four months. We don’t cut corners when we know we’ll need them but we don’t build things without that need. We don’t like inefficiency but we dislike operationalizing one-off tasks even more.
Risk-oriented. Everything has risk, but a mature team knows how to make these tradeoffs. That’s why we built the MVP fast––because time is your most valuable asset and is practically fungible with money in the startup world.
Data-obsessed. We all look at data and pull it, and we believe that understanding the mechanics can yield valuable insights. Complex systems require elegant, not just simple solutions. You absolutely need to be interested in data if you want to leverage your knowledge of systems.
Lucky. That’s how we look at this journey so far. From our timing of fundraising, to the circumstances in which we came together, to the initial product traction we’re getting, there’s no other word to describe it. We are grateful you are reading this, and we know that if you’re meant to be with us on this journey, then we will see you soon.

Twitch is the world’s biggest live streaming service, with global communities built around gaming, entertainment, music, sports, cooking, and more. It is where thousands of communities come together for whatever, every day.

We’re about community, inside and out. You’ll find coworkers who are eager to team up, collaborate, and smash (or elegantly solve) problems together. We’re on a quest to empower live communities, so if this sounds good to you, see what we’re up to on LinkedIn and Twitter, and discover the projects we’re solving on our Blog. Be sure to explore our Interviewing Guide to learn how to ace our interview process.

About The Team

The Community Discovery Machine Learning (CDML) team powers the systems that help millions of active viewers find the creators and communities they'll enjoy most. Powering the home page recommendations, browse, search, and feed ranking experiences, this team and its algorithms are at the heart of enabling the connections that make Twitch a great place for so many users.

About The Role

Data is critical to the algorithms that power the recommendation, search, and ranking systems. It's also critical to making decisions, especially working on systems that are themselves data-driven. As a Senior Data Scientist on the CDML team, you'll be responsible for helping drive improvements to the machine learning systems as well as analytics to drive decision-making.

While there is a team of Applied Scientists building and shipping the algorithms themselves, data science can help improve these systems directly. In this role, you can identify and build new signals to input into the models. We're also working on the value model that the algorithm optimizes, and your input will be critical to understanding the tradeoffs and balancing multiple objectives in a scientific way.

We also still have big unanswered analytics questions to solve. How often do viewers just want to get to the content they already know they want to watch, and when are they open to exploring new channels? These are the sorts of questions you'll be tackling.

You can work in San Francisco, CA; New York, NY; or Seattle, WA.

You Will:



Inform product strategies by defining and updating core metrics for each initiative
Estimate the opportunity sizing of new features the team could take on
Identify and build new signals to incorporate into the algorithms driving recommendations, search, and feed ranking at Twitch
Identify metric tradeoff ratios that help inform value model choices, long-term impact from early-growth-funnel users, and other product decisions
Establish analytical framework for your team: ad-hoc analysis, automated dashboards, and self-service reporting tools to surface key data to stakeholders
Design A/B experiments to drive product direction with iterative innovation and measurement
Work hand-in-hand with business, product, engineering, and design to proactively influence and inform teammates' decisions throughout the product life cycle
Distill ambiguous product or business questions, find clever ways to answer them, and to quantify the uncertainty



You Have:



BA/BS in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or equivalent industry experience
5+ years of experience as a data scientist or data analyst in a high velocity, data-driven environment
5+ years of machine learning/statistical modeling data analysis tools and techniques, and parameters that affect their performance experience
Expert SQL skills and proficiency in Python/R
Experience using data to create insight, drive business decisions and influence leadership



Bonus Points



MS/MA or higher in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related technical field
Experience working on algorithms powering large-scale consumer services
Experience in a data science team working on customer software products, analytics, and insights
Experience working with software development and operational event data
Familiarity with Twitch, either as a viewer or creator (or both!)

You will develop deep understandings of user behaviors and build attribution models to understand our marketing campaign efficiency. Main responsibilities includes


Inform customer acquisition strategies and support growth marketing decisions
Experienced in solving the attribution puzzle and understanding the incrementality of marketing channels and campaigns. Able to assess the true impact of marketing efforts and refine strategies for maximum ROI.
Customer Journey Analysis: Deep understanding of customer journey phases, from awareness to conversion, and expertise in analyzing key business metrics across the funnel to identify opportunities for growth and optimization.

What We’re Like


Scrappy. We had a product goal and put out the MVP, collecting our first users with steady growth via paid channels in four months. We don’t cut corners when we know we’ll need them but we don’t build things without that need. We don’t like inefficiency but we dislike operationalizing one-off tasks even more.
Risk-oriented. Everything has risk, but a mature team knows how to make these tradeoffs. That’s why we built the MVP fast––because time is your most valuable asset and is practically fungible with money in the startup world.
Data-obsessed. We all look at data and pull it, and we believe that understanding the mechanics can yield valuable insights. Complex systems require elegant, not just simple solutions. You absolutely need to be interested in data if you want to leverage your knowledge of systems.
Lucky. That’s how we look at this journey so far. From our timing of fundraising, to the circumstances in which we came together, to the initial product traction we’re getting, there’s no other word to describe it. We are grateful you are reading this, and we know that if you’re meant to be with us on this journey, then we will see you soon.

Ter versterking van ons team zijn we op zoek naar een veelzijdige Data & AI Scientist die niet alleen klantprojecten oppakt, maar ook de interne werkwijze binnen de afdeling helpt vormgeven en verder uitbouwt.

Wat ga je doen?

Als Data & AI Scientist werk je nauw samen met onze klanten om hun digitale vraagstukken te vertalen naar datagedreven oplossingen. Je helpt bij het ontwerpen, bouwen en beheren van data- en AI-oplossingen, en adviseert zowel extern (klanten) als intern (collega’s) over de beste aanpak. Daarnaast speel je een sleutelrol in het bepalen van de “way of work” binnen onze nieuwe data & AI-afdeling, denk hierbij aan methodieken, processen en tools die nodig zijn om succesvol te blijven in een snel veranderende markt. Verantwoordelijkheden die hierbij komen kijken zijn o.a.:


Klantcontact & projectmanagement:
Fungeren als aanspreekpunt voor klanten, waarbij je hun behoeften in kaart brengt en vertaalt naar concrete data- en AI-projecten
Meewerken aan het opstellen van projectplannen, begrotingen en tijdslijnen en de voortgang bewaken
Data-infrastructuur & engineering:
Ontwerpen en implementeren van schaalbare data-architecturen en data pipelines (ETL/ELT)
Waarborgen van datakwaliteit, -beveiliging en -integriteit binnen verschillende klantomgevingen
Data-analyse & AI-modellen:
Uitvoeren van geavanceerde analyses, data-exploratie en het bouwen van machine learning-modellen (bijv. voorspellende modellen, NLP, computer vision)
Visualiseren van resultaten in dashboards en rapportages, en deze op een heldere manier presenteren aan zowel technische als niet-technische doelgroepen
Innovatie & strategie:
Actief bijdragen aan het vormgeven van processen, methodieken en best practices voor onze data & AI-afdeling
Op de hoogte blijven van nieuwe tools, technieken en trends binnen data science en AI, en deze vertalen naar kansen voor onze klanten en onze eigen organisatie
Kennisdeling & samenwerking:
Nauwe samenwerking met multidisciplinaire teams (Software development, marketing, performance) en coaching van collega’s op het gebied van data- en AI-technologieën
Zorgen voor een cultuur van continu leren en verbeteren binnen de afdeling
Waar ga je dat doen?

Endeavour is the place to be voor wie op topniveau wil werken bij een full service digital agency. Wij zijn een team van 150 avonturiers die niet alleen focussen op het resultaat, maar ook op de weg daar naartoe. We houden van experimenteren en ontdekken. Van leren en bijsturen. Van hard werken en hard spelen. Of je hart nu ligt bij marketing of tech; je vindt altijd mensen die jouw liefde voor het vak delen en je uitdagen om te groeien en te leren.

Je gaat werken in het Endeavour HQ, op 500 meter afstand van station Haarlem. We zitten in een oud fabriekspand, dat net even wat meer creatieve vibe heeft dan een ‘gewoon’ kantoorpand, maar wel met de modernste faciliteiten! Onze favoriete onderdelen zijn het dakterras (top voor borrels in de zon), de barista corner, de bar met DJ booth en de pooltafel!

Jij:


Afgeronde hbo- of wo-opleiding in een relevante richting (bijv. Informatica, Wiskunde, Data Science, Statistiek)
Meerdere jaren ervaring in een rol als Data Analyst, Data Scientist of Data Engineer, bij voorkeur bij een digital agency of consultancy
Aantoonbare ervaring met programmeertalen zoals Python, R en SQL, en data-engineering tools (bijv. Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, Airflow)
Kennis van BI- en visualisatietools (bijv. Power BI, Tableau, Looker) en ervaring met cloudomgevingen (AWS, Azure of GCP)
Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en gevoel voor klantgericht werken; je kunt complexe materie begrijpelijk maken voor diverse doelgroepen
Proactief, ondernemend en enthousiast om samen met ons de data & AI-afdeling op te bouwen en te optimaliseren


Wat bieden we jou?

Bij Endeavour krijg je de mogelijkheid om je talenten te benutten en nog verder te ontwikkelen. En verder:


Een competitief salaris met aantrekkelijke secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden
24 vakantiedagen bij een fulltime dienstverband, en daarnaast de mogelijkheid om de standaard nationale feestdagen om te zetten naar vrije dagen op momenten die voor jou belangrijk zijn. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan Chinees Nieuwjaar, Eid el fitr, Jom Kipoer of Gay Pride
De kans om mee te bouwen aan een relatief nieuw team binnen een gerenommeerde full service agency
Een functie met veel verantwoordelijkheid en vrijheid
Een werkplek op een waanzinnige en unieke locatie in Haarlem
Een informele omgeving met enthousiaste, gedreven collega’s
Een budget voor persoonlijke ontwikkeling
Een goede pensioenregeling
De mogelijkheid om flexibele werktijden aan te houden

Job Description

We are seeking a computational scientist to join the Data & Computational Sciences (DCS) team at the Boston, MA site of Vertex Pharmaceuticals. The individual is expected to bring a broad experience in analyzing multiple chemical and biological datatypes, to address questions that arise in our disease programs that are characterized by multiple, potentially orthogonal experimental approaches. The goal of these efforts is to use integrative approaches to propose hypotheses that drive experimentation. The results of such verification should feedback into the analyses, leading to cycle of experimentation and computation that ultimately lead to insights into biological mechanism that drive disease biology, and enable data-driven decision making

The candidate will collaborate with colleagues in DCS and experimental scientists across Vertex to design studies, and develop and apply analyses across multiple datatypes, to identify key insights with a critical impact on the discovery and development of transformative therapies. It will be critical to leverage and integrate relevant data available, and also suggest new studies or data types that can drive additional decision-making.

While the initial focus will be on questions in drug discovery and research, future application may include other related scientific areas in pre-clinical and pharmaceutical sciences.

Responsibilities


Formulate hypotheses to address key scientific questions, identify, or if needed, develop analytic methods to interrogate multiple, heterogeneous datasets to test the hypotheses
Identify questions and key data that could be answered by an integrative data analytics approach; partner with key stakeholders to source and acquire these data.
Recommend experiments to test out hypotheses or to generate specific data to support analytical approaches
Distill complex analyses and scientific results into key take-home messages and recommendations for next steps to a broad audience.
Identify published methods and databases that are relevant for integrative analysis and bring them in-house for evaluation, and if applicable work with relevant stakeholders to productionize their use
Bridge between experimental and computational scientists, ensuring that the results of computation are effectively communicated to stakeholders within DCS and other departments
Where relevant, be responsible for prototyping pipelines to create integrated datasets that combine internal and/or external data sources, and work with colleagues in DTE to productionize such datasets for broader use within DCS
As an emerging expert in the field, provide reliable advice to other team members on a regular basis.


Qualifications


A PhD (or equivalent) in computational sciences, with 4-7 years of relevant experience in a cross-functional informatics or data science role
Experience in analyzing one or more chemical and biological datatypes such as small molecule structure-activity, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics or imaging, and ideally experience in working with multiple such data types
Familiarity with database technologies (such as SQL), experience querying public databases such as ChEMBL, OpenTargets, GTEx or STRINGdb, and integrating & harmonizing data from one or more of such databases
Very strong programming skills, ideally in Python and/or R; solid understanding of statistics
Experience in the use of machine learning methods as applied to chemical or biological data
Familiarity with data visualization tools and best practices
Familiarity with software development best practices such as version control and unit testing
Excellent oral and written communication skills.
A team-oriented growth mindset that welcomes feedback from others and supports other team members; a positive attitude that enthusiastically tackles and overcomes challenges
