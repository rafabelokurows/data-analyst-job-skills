About Merchant Group at Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business. Their core mission is to provide merchants with self-service tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use.

About The Merchant Analytics Team

Merchant Analytics is an embedded analytics function within the Merchant Group. The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4-5+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

🎄Please note that we might have delays due to the festive season.

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Healthcare workers speak freely and our AI automatically generates the correct structured forms.

We are YC-funded and grow quickly. Our customers like Caritas, Contilia, and TÜV NORD create thousands of documentation records every single day.

Today speech recognition is primarily used as a “fun” gimmick for consumers, who set kitchen timers with their Alexa speaker. We build a completely new class of speech-powered applications, to supercharge the professional workforce. By focusing on individual workflows like healthcare or vehicle inspections, we create truly magical user experiences and save each user 30 minutes per day in administrative work. Don’t believe it? See for yourself in our 3-minute product demo (https://youtu.be/AlkVD4OwCQk).

The entire system is built in-house, giving us full control over the user experience, product design, NLP models, and speech recognition. Our custom speech recognition models already outperform Google with 10x lower error rates and we are just getting started!

If you ever wanted to work at the bleeding edge of product design, applied machine learning research, and MLOps, you should apply. You get to build products with daily user feedback, train AI models on real-world data, and ship to production on a daily basis.

At voize new software is deployed to production every 5h on average! We deploy new AI models every 24h and have one of the largest speech data sets for medical documentation.

Tasks

We’re looking for team members who enjoy talking to customers, iterating & shipping quickly.

As an ML developer, you will take core responsibility for the design, training, evaluation, and deployment of our deep learning models in the space of speech recognition and NLP. The models you will build and work on are at the heart of our applications and are directly impacting the end-user. You get to engineer large self-supervised trainings as well as fast inference for mobile devices and hosted environments.

Requirements

You should be comfortable with the following tech stack


Python
Deep Learning Frameworks (preferably PyTorch)
Speech recognition or NLP & Transformer models
Typical Software Engineering skills like Git, Docker, etc
Bonus: Kotlin, React Native / Typescript



Team Work & Personal Skills:


You have to be able to work in a team, communicate clearly, take ownership over your work and share feedback with your teammates.
You need to feel empathy for the user and have a deep passion for great product experiences. You will talk to users, listen to their feedback, understand their daily challenges, and translate those insights into product decisions.
You need great time management skills and be self-sufficient. Your colleges have to be able to rely on you.



Language & Region


You need to be able to speak German fluently. (especially to talk to customers)
You need to live in Germany and be legally allowed to work in Germany.



Benefits


voize is based in Berlin and has a remote-friendly workplace.
We offer flexible work hours and believe that you know best when you want to work
We have an open culture and regular team events
As a fast-growing startup, there are new challenges daily and plenty of learning opportunities for your personal development
Own part of the company through stock option packages



Interview Process

To help us determine that we are both a great fit for each other and are happy to change the world together for years to come, we run a 4 stage interview process. This process is usually completed in 2-3 weeks.


First Call with the founder (Remote):



This is a more informal video call with you and one of our founders, to get to know you, and share more details on the role. Together we want to determine if this role is a great fit for you and get a basic understanding of your personal interests and technical & soft skills.


Technical Interview with CTO (Remote):



In this video call, we want to learn more about your technical skills and past projects you have worked on.

The best way to impress us is by showing us a project you’ve built and walking us through the 2 hardest technical/design decisions you had to make.

Mostly, we want to know that you can code and ship fairly involved systems, and speak to them with clarity on the details. This tends to be a good indication that an engineer had strong ownership and showed autonomy in making a product or technical decisions.


Pair Programming Challenge (Remote):



At this stage, we want to show you the kind of challenges we are facing on a daily basis. In a pair programming setting, you will get access to a portion of our system and will debug an Error we’ve introduced or build a prototype of a new feature.


Onboarding



If you and our team both see a great culture and technical fit, we will send you a job offer and walk you through our onboarding process.

In your first week, you will ship your very own first feature to production! We will prepare a great first task, help you along the way and celebrate the release and direct user feedback.

Vinted Marketplace is the largest online international C2C marketplace in Europe dedicated to second-hand fashion, with millions of registered members spanning 20+ markets in Europe and North America. With a mission to make second-hand the first choice worldwide, Vinted enables people to sell and buy second-hand clothes and lifestyle items from each other, helping give those items a second or even third life.

Vinted Go launched in 2022, with a focus on developing products and solutions for more seamless shipping and delivery across Europe. Vinted Go has connected more than 40 carriers and more than 200,000 PUDO points across Europe to support the delivery of millions of parcels per year.

Information about the position

Currently, Vinted’s Security & Privacy (S&P) domain lacks analytics capabilities to quantifiable measure the impact on members (customers) and business. Hence, S&P is joining forces with the Data Science & Analytics (DSA) department. In this role, you’ll be the first decision scientist in the domain. That means that you’ll have the opportunity to shape the domain and help make data-driven decisions. For that, you will define meaningful metrics, investigate the relation between the work the domain does versus the impact on the business (e.g. through experimentation) and improve risk estimations with statistically sound methods. Since there is no Analytics Engineer in the domain, you’ll occasionally have to write some dbt jobs to transform the data you use.

Define meaningful metrics - validate existing metrics and help to develop new metrics which are meaningful for decision making across Vinted.
Quantify our impact - find a way to translate technical security and privacy results to business metrics, e.g. did our anti-phishing efforts help to improve experience for the members?
Risk estimation - improve risk evaluation with more statistically sound methods.
Work on improved detection - provide expertise on tools and techniques for anomaly detection (e.g. fraud, scraping)
Collaborate with Analytics Engineers and Decision Scientists from our Group Applied Data domain


About You


Demonstrated working experience as a Decision Scientist, Data Analyst, or other role with a strong data component.
BSc or MSc in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, Econometrics, Applied Mathematics, Engineering, or another related field (equivalent working experience is also acceptable)
Programming experience (for example Python or R)
Proficient in SQL and experience with dashboarding tools (e.g. Looker, Tableau, etc.). Open to learn dbt and Analytics Engineering best practices.
Affinity with the ‘Security and Privacy’ practices, e.g. understanding the generic concepts behind privacy enhancing technologies, risk estimation, anomaly detection, etc.
Strong interpersonal skills and a good communicator who can present complex topics clearly and persuasively to different audiences and senior stakeholders
Ability to deal with ambiguity and to combine data insights with strategic thinking
Excellent written and spoken English


Work perks

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high-quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That's where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Staff Data Scientist at Aignostics, you will play a crucial role in shaping the scientific and technical direction and integrity of our data science platform, projects, and products. You will work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art for digital pathology. Your expertise will be instrumental in driving scientific and technical excellence across all data science teams, ensuring we deliver high-quality, scalable solutions that transform complex biomedical data into actionable insights for cancer research and diagnostics. You will work within the Data Science Staff team.

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ machine learners, software engineers, applied scientists, pathologists, and biologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive, and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup, you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take on significant responsibilities, and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

Data Science or Machine Learning? We do both at Aignostics, and are convinced that both are needed for success. You can expect to work on a broad spectrum of topics from deep learning with foundation and other state-of-the-art models on terabytes of data to projects in low sample regimes and very high-dimensional and multimodal data. We have nearly all the data science challenges you can think of for you!

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Engelhart was founded in 2013 by BTG Pactual Group as a commodities trading company. Its business model is “asset light” and highly diversified – giving it the ability to adapt effectively and nimbly to changing market conditions. It has assembled successful multidisciplinary teams, leveraging advanced fundamental analysis with deep quantitative and weather research capabilities. Its activities are underpinned by strong risk management practices and by powerful technology and operational excellence. Its exceptional teams have diverse global backgrounds and decades of experience, and are driven by a highly collaborative culture, across products and competencies.

In 2024, Engelhart acquired Trailstone, a global energy trading and technology company. The acquisition provides Engelhart with new expertise, analytics and proprietary technology which is used to provide risk management and optimisation services to manage the intermittency of renewable power generation for its client base. The acquisition also expanded Engelhart’s capabilities into physical natural gas across North America.

Its talented and experienced individuals work together according to its four company values: be bold, be collaborative, be proactive, be your best.

Software Engineer, Python

About the Role

We are looking for an experienced back-end Python software engineer to join our growing London office. This role will join the Trading & Commercial Development Team, developing best in class back-end services and microservices for our renewables trading platform, with Python.

The team is building a world-class product to help us scale and bring renewables to many more power markets in the world, while trading many more smaller electricity assets. This project is expanding at pace, following Trailstone’s merger with Engelhart Commodities Trading Partners. As a result, this role will be joining an international team with tangible impact on our platform's success from day one.

This will be a full-time role, owning the following responsibilities:


Design, develop and maintain containerised services for auction-based renewables trading.
Work in a cross-functional team with engineers, business analysts, traders, data engineers and data scientists.
Stay up to date with the latest trends in technology and continuously improve our code base, systems, and processes.
Mentor junior members in the team by emphasising code quality and conducting pull requests and code reviews.


About You

This person will be a seasoned developer, experienced working with time-sensitive hybrid-cloud systems, in order to deliver immediate impact to our growing renewables trading platform. This person will be working closely with commercial stakeholders on a regular basis, so experience collaborating with non-technical staff will help set someone up for success.

We believe the following essential skills & experiences will best set someone up for success in this role, therefore will be prioritising the following:


Significant relevant Python experience.
Strong knowledge of object-oriented, functional and asynchronous programming and design patterns.
Substantial SQL experience and understanding of relational database fundamentals.
A passion for delivering clean code and working with a test-driven mindset.
An appreciation of working in a hybrid-cloud and container-driven architecture (partly on-premise and partly AWS).
Domain knowledge in the energy or financial sector is highly desirable.
Desirable, but not essential: Experience developing services in C#




Our Tech Stack

Our tech stack includes Python (FastAPI, Pandas), AWS (ECS, Aurora), Redis, Docker, Atlassian (Jira, Bitbucket), SQL Server, C# and more.

Locations

This role can be based in either our Berlin or our London office, following the preference of the individual. You can find our office addresses on our website.

We believe in inclusivity and are therefore dedicated to ensuring all employees – across gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, life experience, background and more – feel welcome and included in the company. We promote diversity because we believe it is essential to our ability to think holistically.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high-quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That's where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals.

As a Staff Data Scientist at Aignostics, you will play a crucial role in shaping the scientific and technical direction and integrity of our data science platform, projects, and products. You will work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art for digital pathology. Your expertise will be instrumental in driving scientific and technical excellence across all data science teams, ensuring we deliver high-quality, scalable solutions that transform complex biomedical data into actionable insights for cancer research and diagnostics. You will work within the Data Science Staff team.

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ machine learners, software engineers, applied scientists, pathologists, and biologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive, and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup, you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take on significant responsibilities, and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

Data Science or Machine Learning? We do both at Aignostics, and are convinced that both are needed for success. You can expect to work on a broad spectrum of topics from deep learning with foundation and other state-of-the-art models on terabytes of data to projects in low sample regimes and very high-dimensional and multimodal data. We have nearly all the data science challenges you can think of for you!

We are not working with recruiters on this role !

Sequel is a community of the world's best athletes investing in the world's best startups, making a positive impact.

We are on a mission to help athletes build legacies for their families and for the world.

We are a seed-stage company founded and backed by experienced serial entrepreneurs with several successful exits.

A world-class team is looking for a world-class full-time Data Scientist to help us build and improve our data tools to make better investment decisions.

What You Will Be Working On


Implementing tools that surface trends in the investment world
Strengthen our data-driven methods of identifying startups
Improve our data driven platform Senna



We are here to win - not just to take part. Just like our clients who operate at the elite level of sport, we understand that in order to win; we need to put in the work. This means going the extra mile, being willing to do what others will not and holding ourselves to a higher standard. Some companies play to not lose, we play to win. We are proactive, decisive and have the courage to take risks.

We pay it forward - we are always helpful. To customers, to partners and most importantly to each other. Not because it will ‘pay back', because it's the right thing to do.

We are adaptable - we understand in a world that is changing faster than ever before - the only constant is change. The average lifespan of a Fortune 100 company in 1958 was 61 years, now it is 18 years. We adapt to a changing world, constantly iterating, moving forward and staying relevant.

Impossible is an opinion - we are on a mission to build something which has never been done before from the ground up. It will be a hard journey full of challenges which are currently unsolved. Our culture is defined by the fact that when we are confronted with challenges, we work from the assumption that it is possible to overcome them.

We are transparent - we challenge each other. Regardless of title, seniority or reporting lines. We give feedback and we are hungry to receive it. We value honest feedback delivered with kindness, and we value people who ask questions.

We always trust, respect and care for each other - it's no easy feat working in a startup, let alone one with goals as ambitious as ours. At sequel we believe no one is ever too busy to support fellow team members and that we should always be helpful, inclusive and selfless in the way we work. Diversity of background and thought is celebrated as we respect and appreciate what makes us all different. We don't tolerate free riders, egos or workplace politics.

We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & BenefitsAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




DiversityAt Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.




We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process.

We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our iwocaPay team

iwocaPay works with sellers to offer innovative Trade Credit and Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) solutions for business customers. Those sellers are essential to our success, as we need them to offer iwocaPay to their customers, who in turn use us to spread the cost of their purchase, for improving cash flow and operational flexibility.

The Company

Fast, flexible finance empowers small businesses to manage their cash flow better and seize opportunities - making their business and the economy stronger as a whole. At iwoca, we do just that. We help businesses get the funds they need, when they need it, often within minutes. We’ve already made several billion in funding available to more than 100,000 businesses since we launched in 2012, and positioned ourselves as a leading Fintech in Europe.

With iwocaPay, we’ve created a trade credit solution that has already provided thousands of buyers across the UK with the flexibility to manage cash flow while growing their purchasing power. Our team continues to innovate and expand, driving iwocaPay’s mission to make credit available where it's needed most.

The role

As a Data Scientist within our iwocaPay team, you’ll develop insights for our credit assessment model. Your role will involve evaluating the model, identifying key areas for improvement, and using untapped features to enhance accuracy and reduce friction for customers.

You’ll work collaboratively with Data Scientists across iwoca, sharing expertise with a peer group to deepen your knowledge and apply it to iwocaPay. Additionally, you’ll design and analyse tests and build statistical models to help us reach a broader range of customers.

The Projects

In this role, you'll tackle a few high-impact projects within your first 90 days, designed to drive the evolution of iwocaPay’s risk model and enhance our data capabilities:


Model Evaluation & Improvement: Begin by immersing yourself in our current model to assess its strengths and identify areas for enhancement. You’ll focus on the model’s relevance to iwocaPay and the data sources supporting it.
Data Feature Expansion: Conduct a detailed data assessment to identify new features that could improve model precision and reliability. This includes testing additional data points and exploring off-the-shelf alternatives to sensitive personal data, which add unnecessary friction to the loan application process.
Prototype Testing & Iteration: Start developing and testing initial model iterations, refining as you go. Investigate supplementary data sources, including ecommerce insights, to enrich the model’s accuracy and expand its potential applications within iwocaPay.
Strategic Data Science Influence: Beyond immediate model improvements, you’ll play a pivotal role in shaping iwocaPay’s data science roadmap. By identifying emerging data science techniques and championing best practices, you’ll guide how we apply data science to add deeper value across our offerings, setting the foundation for innovative, scalable solutions that drive future growth.


The Requirements

Essential:

Proficiency with data manipulation and modelling tools, e.g. pandas, statsmodels, R.
Experience with scientific computing and tooling, e.g. NumPy, SciPy, R, Matlab, Mathematica, BLAS.
Self-starter with ability to work autonomously and efficiently manage projects end-to-end.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to adjust your communication style and technical detail based on the audience.


Bonus:


Experience building machine learning models from scratch (e.g. creating custom optimisers)
Advanced knowledge of stochastic processes and related mathematical techniques.
Experience with Bayesian analysis.
Experience with Python (our primary programming language).
Knowledge of financial concepts (e.g. calculations with deterministic cash flows).


The salary

We expect to pay from £70,000 - £100,000 for this role. But, we’re open-minded, so definitely include your salary goals with your application. We routinely benchmark salaries against market rates, and run quarterly performance and salary reviews.

The culture

At iwoca, we prioritise a culture of learning, growth, and support, and invest in the professional development of our team members. We value thought and skill diversity, and encourage you to explore new areas of interest to help us innovate and improve our products and services.

The offices

We put a lot of effort into making iwoca a brilliant place to work:


Offices in London, Leeds, and Frankfurt with plenty of drinks and snacks
Events and clubs, like bingo, comedy nights, yoga classes, football, etc.


The Benefits


Flexible working.
Medical insurance from Vitality, including discounted gym membership
A private GP service (separate from Vitality) for you, your partner, and your dependents.
25 days’ holiday, an extra day off for your birthday, the option to buy or sell an additional five days of annual leave, and unlimited unpaid leave

We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our iwocaPay team

iwocaPay works with sellers to offer innovative Trade Credit and Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) solutions for business customers. Those sellers are essential to our success, as we need them to offer iwocaPay to their customers, who in turn use us to spread the cost of their purchase, for improving cash flow and operational flexibility.

The Company

Fast, flexible finance empowers small businesses to manage their cash flow better and seize opportunities - making their business and the economy stronger as a whole. At iwoca, we do just that. We help businesses get the funds they need, when they need it, often within minutes. We’ve already made several billion in funding available to more than 100,000 businesses since we launched in 2012, and positioned ourselves as a leading Fintech in Europe.

Our mission is to finance one million businesses. We’ll get there by continuing to make our finance ever more relevant and accessible to more businesses by combining cutting-edge technology, data science, and a 5-star customer service.

The function

iwoca's Data Scientists specialise in Supervised Machine Learning, Statistical Inference and Exploratory Statistics, focusing on tabular and time series data. Our work emphasises quantitative predictions through the analysis of conditional probabilities and expectations, using medium-sized datasets.

The team

At iwoca, we’re proud to nurture an entrepreneurial spirit within our teams. This is especially true of iwocaPay, a fast-growing start-up within the business, now with a dedicated team of more than 30 people. With iwocaPay, we’ve created a trade credit solution that has already provided thousands of buyers across the UK with the flexibility to manage cash flow while growing their purchasing power. Our team continues to innovate and expand, driving iwocaPay’s mission to make credit available where it's needed most.

The role

As a Data Scientist within our iwocaPay team, you’ll develop insights for our credit assessment model. Your role will involve evaluating the model, identifying key areas for improvement, and using untapped features to enhance accuracy and reduce friction for customers.

You’ll work collaboratively with Data Scientists across iwoca, sharing expertise with a peer group to deepen your knowledge and apply it to iwocaPay. Additionally, you’ll design and analyse tests and build statistical models to help us reach a broader range of customers.

The Projects

In this role, you'll tackle a few high-impact projects within your first 90 days, designed to drive the evolution of iwocaPay’s risk model and enhance our data capabilities:


Model Evaluation & Improvement: Begin by immersing yourself in our current model to assess its strengths and identify areas for enhancement. You’ll focus on the model’s relevance to iwocaPay and the data sources supporting it.
Data Feature Expansion: Conduct a detailed data assessment to identify new features that could improve model precision and reliability. This includes testing additional data points and exploring off-the-shelf alternatives to sensitive personal data, which add unnecessary friction to the loan application process.
Prototype Testing & Iteration: Start developing and testing initial model iterations, refining as you go. Investigate supplementary data sources, including ecommerce insights, to enrich the model’s accuracy and expand its potential applications within iwocaPay.
Strategic Data Science Influence: Beyond immediate model improvements, you’ll play a pivotal role in shaping iwocaPay’s data science roadmap. By identifying emerging data science techniques and championing best practices, you’ll guide how we apply data science to add deeper value across our offerings, setting the foundation for innovative, scalable solutions that drive future growth.


The Requirements

Essential:


Strong problem-solving skills in probability and statistics, ideally from a quantitative background (e.g., Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, or similar fields).
Proficiency with data manipulation and modelling tools, e.g. pandas, statsmodels, R.
Experience with scientific computing and tooling, e.g. NumPy, SciPy, R, Matlab, Mathematica, BLAS.
Self-starter with ability to work autonomously and efficiently manage projects end-to-end.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to adjust your communication style and technical detail based on the audience.


Bonus:


Experience building machine learning models from scratch (e.g. creating custom optimisers)
Advanced knowledge of stochastic processes and related mathematical techniques.
Experience with Bayesian analysis.
Experience with Python (our primary programming language).
Knowledge of financial concepts (e.g. calculations with deterministic cash flows).


The salary

We expect to pay from £70,000 - £100,000 for this role. But, we’re open-minded, so definitely include your salary goals with your application. We routinely benchmark salaries against market rates, and run quarterly performance and salary reviews.

The culture

At iwoca, we prioritise a culture of learning, growth, and support, and invest in the professional development of our team members. We value thought and skill diversity, and encourage you to explore new areas of interest to help us innovate and improve our products and services.

The offices

We put a lot of effort into making iwoca a brilliant place to work:


Offices in London, Leeds, and Frankfurt with plenty of drinks and snacks
Events and clubs, like bingo, comedy nights, yoga classes, football, etc.


The Benefits


Flexible working.
Medical insurance from Vitality, including discounted gym membership
A private GP service (separate from Vitality) for you, your partner, and your dependents.
25 days’ holiday, an extra day off for your birthday, the option to buy or sell an additional five days of annual leave, and unlimited unpaid leave
A one-month, fully paid sabbatical after four years.
Instant access to emotional and mental health support.
3% Pension contributions and share options.
Generous parental leave and a nursery tax benefit scheme to help you save money.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$140,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We understand that a resume can only showcase so much during the applicant stage, so we've created prompts in the application for you to share more about yourself. If you've made a career transition (or a few!), you’re self taught in a new role, or you have skills/experience you’d like to highlight, we want to hear more about what you could bring to the table.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$140,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

To do this, we start with our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization.

Data Science is at the heart of Lyft’s products and decision-making. You will leverage data and rigorous, analytical thinking to shape our products and make business decisions. This will involve identifying and scoping opportunities, shaping team priorities, recommending and implementing technical solutions, designing experiments, and measuring the impact of new features.

The Verticals team encompasses 3 critical and unique products / marketplaces within Lyft: airports, scheduled rides, and events. Airports are one of the most important, impactful, and complex parts of Lyft’s Rideshare business, as they are a key part of both the rider and driver Lyft experiences and have unique considerations and dynamics. Scheduled rides allow riders to book a ride in advance with high reliability, and enable drivers to add structure to their work schedule. Lastly, events such as concerts or sporting games require similar considerations of special operations to ensure a seamless experience for both riders and drivers.

As a Data Scientist on the Verticals team, you will collaborate with engineering, product, design, and operations to think critically about the current rider and driver experience and implement product enhancements to facilitate market growth. The ideal candidate can apply strong business acumen to propose product changes, develop end-to-end technical solutions, and is comfortable working with a highly cross functional team. In this role, you will help us tackle problems such as:


Are we able to forecast ride demand and implement driver guidance to ensure riders can rely on Lyft for an airport ride at all times of the day?
How can we use these ride predictions to adjust ride offerings available at airports and for scheduled rides?
How can we develop a technical model to predict ride wait times and communicate this to drivers?
What is the most helpful way to display ride information to drivers so they can make informed decisions?
What rider segments should we target with ride incentives to grow our marketshare for these verticals?


Responsibilities


Leverage data and analytic frameworks to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency, recommending technical solutions to drive business impact
Construct and fit statistical or machine learning models to make production decisions such as changes to ride offerings; focusing on model proposal and offline model development
Design and analyze online experiments; communicate results and act on launch decisions
Partner with product managers, engineers, marketers, designers, and operators to translate data insights into decisions and action
Develop analytical frameworks to monitor business and product performance, leveraging experiments and causal inference
Establish metrics that measure the health of our products, the business, as well as the driver experience


Experience


Degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, economics, applied math, operations research or engineering (advanced degrees preferred), or relevant work experience
3+ years of industry experience in a data science, analytics, or management consulting role.
Ability to develop machine learning models, focusing on offline development and feature engineering, to drive business impact
End-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, analysis, and visualization
Ability to manage, influence, negotiate, and inspire others in a fast-moving environment
Proficiency in SQL and Python
Strong oral and written communication skills, and ability to collaborate with cross-functional partners


Benefits


Extended health and dental coverage options, along with life insurance and disability benefits
Mental health benefits
Family building benefits
Access to a Health Care Savings Account
In addition to provincial observed holidays, team members get 15 days paid time off, with an additional day for each year of service
4 Floating Holidays each calendar year prorated based off of date of hire
10 paid sick days per year regardless of province
18 weeks of paid parental leave. Biological, adoptive, and foster parents are all eligible

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for fresh graduates who meet the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


Enrolled in a quantitative PhD program (e.g. Mathematics, Engineering, Computer Science, Statistics, or Economics) with the expectation of graduating in winter 2024 or spring/summer 2025
Experience with a scientific computing language (such as Python, R, etc) and SQL. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present!
Knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience communicating and collaborating with multidisciplinary stakeholders in a team environment
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience writing and debugging data pipelines
Demonstrated ability to evaluate and receive feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders via experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects
Ability to learn new systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
This role is not eligible for hire in the Greater Seattle Area, San Francisco Bay Area, or New York City. We are hiring these positions in Chicago, IL or Toronto, Ontario, Canada.



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Yes, we’re a credit card company. But we’re more than that too. We’re driven by what our customers want, and how to make their lives simpler.

We’re always looking for creative ways to offer digital solutions that make sense for our customers. With your help, we’ll build the next generation of banking in Canada based on customer-focused values, compelling products and great engineering.

Working with us

How do we do things at Capital One Canada? We listen — to our people, and to our customers. We change with the times and have adopted a flexible hybrid model (remote and/or in-office). A flexible hybrid working model is one that creates the opportunity to match the work that we do to the environment that best supports that work. Associates working in the hybrid model are expected to come into the office 3 days a week across Tuesdays and Thursdays, reserving Mondays and Fridays as company-wide virtual days. As was true before the pandemic, expectations of being in the office will be balanced with personal life flexibility. We recognize that everyone has a unique working pattern so we’re open to discussing flexible working arrangements that will best accommodate you.

At Capital One we’re committed to diversity, inclusion and belonging . We strive to build a culture where diverse perspectives are valued, innovative ideas are encouraged and inclusive behaviours are embedded in everything we do to positively impact associates.

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few roles based in offices. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder led, profitable and growing.

We are hiring an MLOps Field Engineer to help global companies embrace AI/ML in their business, using the latest open source capabilities on public and private cloud infrastructure, Linux and Kubernetes. Our team applies expert insights to real-world customer problems, enabling the enterprise adoption of Ubuntu, Kubeflow, MLFlow, Feast, DVC and related analytics, machine learning and data technologies. We are working to create the world's best open source data platform, covering traditional SQL databases and today's NoSQL data stores, as well as the machinery which turns data into insights and executable models.

The people who love this role are MLOps engineers who enjoy customer conversations and solving customer problems during the presales cycle. They are solutions architects who like to solve customer problems through architecture, presentations and training. This role is highly focused on designing ML architectures for external customers. It is not a software development role.

This role is particularly suited to candidates with a technical background who are business minded and driven by commercial success. This role is on our global Field Engineering team and will work closely with enterprise sales leads. We are specifically looking for people interested in solving the most difficult problems in modern data architectures. Training LLMs on multiple K8s clusters deployed on a hybrid cloud infrastructure with GPU sharing across multiple teams? Processing 10M events in real time for financial transactions? Object detection on 10k parallel 4K video streams? These are the problems we solve day to day.

Location: Most of our colleagues work from home. We are growing teams in EMEA, Americas and APAC time zones, so can accommodate candidates from almost any country.

What your day will look like

The global Field Engineering team members are Linux and cloud solutions architects for our customers, designing private and public cloud solutions fitting their workload needs. They are the cloud consultants who work hands-on with the technologies by deploying, testing and handing over the solution to our support or managed services team at the end of a project. They are also software engineers who use Python to develop Kubernetes operators and Linux open source infrastructure-as-code.


Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Architect cloud infrastructure solutions like Kubernetes, Kubeflow, OpenStack, and Spark
Deliver solutions either on-premise or in public cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
Collect customer business requirements and advise them on Ubuntu and relevant open source applications
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with the company values
Deliver presentations and demonstrations of Ubuntu Pro and AI/ML capabilities to prospective and current clients
Liaise with product teams to give them feedback on requirements to influence roadmap
Work collaboratively with your sales team to reach our common targets
Global travel up to 30% of time for internal, external events and customer meetings


What we are looking for in you


Exceptional academic track record from both high school and university
Undergraduate degree in a technical subject or a compelling narrative about your alternative chosen path
