We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion is seeking a Finance Data Scientist to join our growing team. In this role, you'll work at the intersection of Finance, Product, and Go-to-Market, using data to drive Notion's growth and success. The ideal candidate is a strong communicator with a growth mindset who collaborates effectively and focuses on action and impact.

Your work will translate initiatives from both our self-serve and sales-assisted businesses into tangible revenue outcomes. You'll partner with the Strategic Finance team to identify growth opportunities, develop insights that deepen our understanding of the business, and forecast future performance.

What You'll Achieve


Partner with Strategic Finance to understand the drivers of our business and accelerate Notion's growth
Deliver proactive insights on key business drivers, financial trends, and potential areas for growth or optimization
Build and refine data science forecasts for both short-term and long-range planning
Empower others through self-service tools and reports that drive awareness and understanding of key metrics
Work with Data Engineering to build core data models that power operational and exploratory data analyses



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have 2+ years of experience in analytics and data science, with a track record of collaborating with finance, business operations, growth, or go-to-market teams
You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)
You have experience building predictive models and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness
You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $136,000 - $160,000 per year.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion is seeking a Finance Data Scientist to join our growing team. In this role, you'll work at the intersection of Finance, Product, and Go-to-Market, using data to drive Notion's growth and success. The ideal candidate is a strong communicator with a growth mindset who collaborates effectively and focuses on action and impact.

Your work will translate initiatives from both our self-serve and sales-assisted businesses into tangible revenue outcomes. You'll partner with the Strategic Finance team to identify growth opportunities, develop insights that deepen our understanding of the business, and forecast future performance.

What You'll Achieve


Partner with Strategic Finance to understand the drivers of our business and accelerate Notion's growth
Deliver proactive insights on key business drivers, financial trends, and potential areas for growth or optimization
Build and refine data science forecasts for both short-term and long-range planning
Empower others through self-service tools and reports that drive awareness and understanding of key metrics
Work with Data Engineering to build core data models that power operational and exploratory data analyses



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have 2+ years of experience in analytics and data science, with a track record of collaborating with finance, business operations, growth, or go-to-market teams
You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)
You have experience building predictive models and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness
You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Requirements

👤 Do you recognize yourself?

🎓 Your Background


You have a master's in Management/Economics, Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, Biology, or similar - There is no standard study background for data
You are fluent in English and either in Dutch OR French



💼 Your Professional Skills


You have good knowledge and demonstrable experience with ETL and statistical packages (SAS, SPSS, R, Python, Spark). Knowledge of programming languages such as Javascript, Spark, S, C is a plus.
You have technical expertise in data preparation, data models, data mining, and segmentation



🤓 Your Personal Skills


You have strong analytical skills to collect, organize, analyze, and interpret large amounts of data to underline the relevant information regarding a specific business objective
You have a problem-solving mindset; you take a pragmatic approach regarding data science and seek out the simple solution



⚠️ Must Have


You are eligible to work in Belgium and the European Union (please be aware that we do not offer relocation support)



🤗 You will be a great fit if -


You want to be among the first employees to help us shape our organization and grow in the future.
You have a natural care about work quality, showing a professional attitude and passion for service. You are proactive, autonomous, and like to take initiative

Benefits

💜 Working at Agilytic

We aim at creating a work environment that allows you to do exceptional work, grow your skillset and, most importantly, be happy while doing it.

You may work on assignments anywhere in Belgium and neighboring countries like Luxembourg, France, the Netherlands, and the UK. You can expect to interact with IT/data specialists and business executives (marketing, process, customer care).

We believe that data is a means to an end and not an end in itself. We don't use cutting-edge techniques when not suited to the problem we need to solve. We adapt to what the client truly needs, even if it might look less appealing from a technical perspective. For instance, we won't train a neural network predicting marketing performance based on 1000 variables if a simple dashboard showing marketing efficiency across a few dimensions answers the customer's question. All our missions are about data, and so far, approximately 50% of them haven't required any machine learning.

Salary And Benefits


💰 Competitive remuneration package: We offer a competitive remuneration package, a cafeteria plan in which you can allocate your variable remuneration to your preferred advantages (extra days off, electronics... and cash of course)
🏋️ Training roadmap: We will draft together a training roadmap, taking into consideration our internal competencies as well as your interests
🤝 Supportive structure and transparency: What we don't have in scale (yet), we'll make it up with flexibility, support, and transparency. We will be there for you every step of the way, with individual coaching and career roadmapping
🧰 Modern tools: Tools are a means to an end. We want them to help you do your best work, not become a bottleneck. That's why you can expect up-to-date hardware and software tools so that you (hopefully) never have to swear at your computer
🥂 Oh, and a little bit of fun too: We take our work very seriously, but we're not afraid to laugh at ourselves. Life is too short
