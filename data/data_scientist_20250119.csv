About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

Immediate carbon reduction has a more profound effect on global temperature goals than future efforts. Our solutions prioritize immediate operational improvements for significant climate impact. We understand the urgency of now.

We value diversity, equity, and inclusivity. With a diverse range of nationalities and a range of backgrounds represented in our small team, we are building an inclusive environment where our people can bring their authentic selves to work, be respected for who they are and the exceptional work they do. We welcome and actively encourage applications from all sections of society and are committed to offering equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, disability, age, citizenship, or any other basis.

Identify areas where modelling can create uplift in decisions, efficiency and costs.
Explore new data sources and methodologies to improve the customer journey and decisions.




Controlling Credit risk

Propose, monitor and analyse credit decisions, taking into consideration the regulatory environment and customer impact.
Evaluate granular performance against expectations, checking adherence to risk appetite and regulatory requirements.
Define appropriate pricing and limits, based on risk and return principles, working closely with the commercial team to understand market conditions.

About you

Your Approach

Self-motivating, with a natural interest in understanding how things work and fit together.

Solution orientated with a drive to engage others to deliver solutions improving customer experience and profitability.

Exposure working with varying datasources (bureau and openbanking data would be a plus).
Foundational understanding of how credit cards work
Strong coding skills, with a focus on structure and automation
Defining and building insightful MI

How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?


What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?


How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?





The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset


Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems

We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our iwocaPay team

iwocaPay works with sellers to offer innovative Trade Credit and Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) solutions for business customers. Those sellers are essential to our success, as we need them to offer iwocaPay to their customers, who in turn use us to spread the cost of their purchase, for improving cash flow and operational flexibility.

The Company

Fast, flexible finance empowers small businesses to manage their cash flow better and seize opportunities - making their business and the economy stronger as a whole. At iwoca, we do just that. We help businesses get the funds they need, when they need it, often within minutes. We’ve already made several billion in funding available to more than 100,000 businesses since we launched in 2012, and positioned ourselves as a leading Fintech in Europe.

Our mission is to finance one million businesses. We’ll get there by continuing to make our finance ever more relevant and accessible to more businesses by combining cutting-edge technology, data science, and a 5-star customer service.

The function

iwoca's Data Scientists specialise in Supervised Machine Learning, Statistical Inference and Exploratory Statistics, focusing on tabular and time series data. Our work emphasises quantitative predictions through the analysis of conditional probabilities and expectations, using medium-sized datasets.

The team

At iwoca, we’re proud to nurture an entrepreneurial spirit within our teams. This is especially true of iwocaPay, a fast-growing start-up within the business, now with a dedicated team of more than 30 people. With iwocaPay, we’ve created a trade credit solution that has already provided thousands of buyers across the UK with the flexibility to manage cash flow while growing their purchasing power. Our team continues to innovate and expand, driving iwocaPay’s mission to make credit available where it's needed most.

The role

As a Data Scientist within our iwocaPay team, you’ll develop insights for our credit assessment model. Your role will involve evaluating the model, identifying key areas for improvement, and using untapped features to enhance accuracy and reduce friction for customers.

You’ll work collaboratively with Data Scientists across iwoca, sharing expertise with a peer group to deepen your knowledge and apply it to iwocaPay. Additionally, you’ll design and analyse tests and build statistical models to help us reach a broader range of customers.

The Projects

In this role, you'll tackle a few high-impact projects within your first 90 days, designed to drive the evolution of iwocaPay’s risk model and enhance our data capabilities:

The culture

At iwoca, we prioritise a culture of learning, growth, and support, and invest in the professional development of our team members. We value thought and skill diversity, and encourage you to explore new areas of interest to help us innovate and improve our products and services.

Companies spend millions of dollars to store terabytes of data in data lakehouses, but only leverage a fraction of it for predictive tasks. This is because traditional machine learning is slow and time consuming, taking months to perform feature engineering, build training pipelines, and achieve acceptable performance.

At Kumo, we are building a machine learning platform for data lakehouses, enabling data scientists to train powerful Graph Neural Net models directly on their relational data, with only a few lines of declarative syntax known as Predictive Query Language. The Kumo platform enables users to build models a dozen times faster, and achieve better model accuracy than traditional approaches.

As a Data Scientist for EMEA, you will be a technical liaison for Kumo’s customers and prospects in the EMEA region. Your objective is to discover the technical needs of customers and showcase how Kumo can address them (or explain why you think it won’t). With this information, you will craft and tell a story of how Kumo can deliver value to their organization.

Together with the customer and Account Manager, you will put together a plan to solve the customer’s machine learning problems using Kumo. You will leverage your industry knowledge and data science expertise to help the customer craft the solution architecture and machine learning approach for their use cases, and guide them to achieve technical wins. You will maintain relationships with technical champions, ensuring continued success of existing models as well as expansion to new use cases.

This is a fantastic opportunity for someone with deep expertise in machine learning and passion for data science to grow into a confident leader within a dynamic and innovative environment.

The Value You Will Add:


Be a Kumo platform superuser - understand the product in and out and how it should be used to solve customer problems.
Lead the technical discovery to understand the alignment between what Kumo offers and prospective customer expectations.
Conduct product demos of Kumo solving ML problems in a variety of verticals, including finance/fraud, growth/marketing, personalization/commerce, and forecasting/optimization.
Guide the customer to achieve meaningful wins on high-impact ML problems, by leveraging your problem-solving skills, data science knowledge, and industry experience.
Be hands-on, to help customers overcome challenges they may encounter in achieving sufficient model performance, or integrating Kumo into their production systems.
Lead architecture reviews and security assessments.
Maintain meaningful relationships with technical influencers and champions within ML teams, both pre and post-sale.
Educate current Kumo users on how to successfully use our product, best practices, etc. so that they increase usage across a larger and larger number of internal workloads.
Provide market and customer feedback to the Product and Engineering team to refine feature specifications and the product roadmap.
Create broader processes for each customer to go through to ensure we can drive repeatable successes in PoCs.
Generate Kumo platform educational materials to disseminate amongst current users or prospects.


Your Foundation:


Someone who finds genuine satisfaction in solving customer ML problems and helping them deliver value to the business.
5+ years of relevant professional experience working with external customers in deploying AI/ML/data science solutions in production for customers.
Proficiency with ML and data science fundamentals, at the level of a bachelors/graduate program.
Persuasive communication – ability to present, speak, demo well to customer stakeholders and convince them to partner with Kumo!
Self-starter, motivative, resourceful and persistent: demonstrated ability to structure complex problems, take the initiative, and identify creative solutions to deliver outcomes in the face of obstacles.
Knowledge of common data science tools around SQL-based data warehousing (eg. Snowflake, Databricks, DBT), BI tools (eg. Tableau, Looker), workflow orchestration, and ML Ops.
Excellent spoken and written English skills.
Fluency with scripting in Python.
Ability to work effectively across time zones. Teammates will be located from PT to CET time zones. Customers will be in GMT/CET, while occasionally as far as SGT.

Job Title:

Machine Learning Engineer (Data science / Deep learning)

Reports to:

Amy Strange

Closing Date:

19/Jan/2025 23.59 GMT

Job Description:

Machine Learning Engineer (Data science / Deep learning)

From £48,600 With Benefits, Subject To Skills And Experience

Contract term: 3 years

Reports to: Amy Strange, Software Engineering and AI Facility Lead and MANIFEST Consortium Lead, Prof. Samra Turajlic

The role will be placed in the Software Engineering and AI facility and will support the MANIFEST research platform led by Prof. Samra Turajlic (Cancer Dynamics Laboratory).

The Research Group & Project

THE MANIFEST RESEARCH PLATFORM

Harnessing the immune system to treat cancer has revolutionised survival outcomes for many patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies which unleash the brakes from immune cells to kill cancer cells, have become standard of care for many cancer subtypes. The success of existing, emerging and future immunotherapies and their routine use in the NHS is dependent on the appropriate tools, data and technology to rationalise their use and manage their side effects. Nevertheless, almost no biomarkers today can effectively distinguish responders from non-responders, predict toxicity, or guide treatment choices.

An exciting Machine Learning Engineer post is available in the Cancer Dynamics Laboratory. The post holder would work across multiple on-going projects of the lab, including a dedicated role within the MANIFEST project (“Multiomic ANalysis of Immunotherapy Features Evidencing Success and Toxicity”), a newly formed ambitious multi-stakeholder consortium involving academic, industry and NHS partners to deliver deep multi-omic profiling for patients with cancer undergoing immunotherapy. The MANIFEST consortium represents a diverse group of UK-wide experts in cancer research and clinical care comprising major NHS trusts, academic institutes and universities, and industry partners. This grant is funded by the UK Office of Life Sciences (OLS) and the Medical Research Council (MRC).

MANIFEST addresses the critical challenge in cancer treatment: predicting how patients will respond to immunotherapy. By integrating multio-omic data and innovative methodologies, this platform aims to enhance treatment precision and effectiveness.
