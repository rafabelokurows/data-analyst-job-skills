About Merchant Group at Wolt

Wolt as a platform focuses on serving three main groups: customers, couriers, and merchants. In a nutshell, the Merchant Group strives to make Wolt an integral part of our Merchant’s daily business. Their core mission is to provide merchants with self-service tools and automation that are useful, efficient, reliable, and delightful to use.

About The Merchant Analytics Team

Merchant Analytics is an embedded analytics function within the Merchant Group. The team works to unlock insights related to the marketplace and turn them into actionable recommendations that drive the success of merchants at Wolt. While keeping merchants at heart, the analytics team focuses on all kinds of analytics projects that can benefit merchants while ensuring a seamless consumer experience and also supporting Wolt’s marketplace strategy.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field, or equivalent work experience.
4-5+ years of experience in an analytics or data science position within an industry or research setting.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation and causal inference using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

🎄Please note that we might have delays due to the festive season.

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Cherry Ventures is supporting our portfolio with this hire

Berlin based - m/f/d - full-time

What we do at Plato

Plato is building the digital backbone of the global trade economy. Starting with the $48T wholesale industry, we empower the modern wholesaler to connect their people and data in a single analytics and workflow hub. By leveraging data science and AI, we automate workflows and combat labor shortages, making SMB wholesalers competitive with large corporations.

🎯 Why we do what we do

The future of wholesale is data-driven. Unlike popular opinion, Industrial SMEs are ready to make the step to become more proactive in their processes but lack the technology to steer them to success. Our founders come from a wholesale family and gathered a rock star team of ex-Big Tech, VC, and top-tier consulting companies to reshape the operations of this $48tn industry. Our initial product leverages cutting-edge data science to provide customized demand forecasts and product recommendations combined with intelligent workflow automation.

We are about to create category-defining software. Our primary customers are C-suite executives within large-scale wholesale and distribution businesses. We are committed to helping them enhance their decision-making processes and optimize their operations through the smart use of their data - bringing their operations into the 21st century! But don’t just hear it from us! We are supported by a list of top-tier EU & US VCs, advisors, and angels providing insights from some of the best SME tech companies such as Miro, Celonis, Personio, Workday, Forto, and Microsoft.

🔮 What we’re looking for

As a Data Scientist at Plato you will be tackling the complex challenge of building versatile models that serve multiple industries, ranging from construction and steel to technical and HVAC wholesalers. Each industry presents unique data sets and requires a tailored approach.

You will have the opportunity to develop a variety of models, such as recommendation engines, dynamic pricing systems, churn prediction models, and customer segmentation algorithms. You will be responsible for the entire lifecycle of these models, from creation to deployment, and ensuring they scale across different industries.

Our platform generates a wealth of data from user interactions, and a key part of your role will be feeding this data back into the models to continuously improve their performance. You’ll collaborate closely with our data engineering and product teams to ensure our portfolio of data products provide value to our users.

🚀 What you’d be working on


Develop, test, and deploy a wide range of machine learning models, including recommendation systems, dynamic pricing models, churn prediction algorithms, and customer categorisation systems.
Tackle the challenge of building adaptable models that can be customized across various industries, such as construction, technical, and HVAC wholesale, ensuring that industry-specific needs are met.
Continuously refine and update models based on real-time platform data and customer feedback to ensure they evolve with our users’ needs.
Collaborate with data engineers and ML engineers to build efficient data pipelines that feed into and optimise machine learning models.
Recommendations System knowledge
Design experiments to assess model performance and iteratively improve accuracy and scalability.
Implement automated model retraining and monitoring systems to ensure that models remain relevant and continue to perform in production environments.
Work closely with the product and engineering teams to align model outputs with business goals and deliver actionable insights to customers.
Build processes to efficiently manage the lifecycle of machine learning models, including versioning, experimentation, and reproducibility across different deployments.



🏅 What you bring along


5+ years of professional experience in data science, with a strong focus on the development and deployment of machine learning models.
Hands-on experience with recommender systems is highly valued—this will be a core component of the role.
A strong generalist mindset, capable of owning the full product lifecycle—from translating business problems into data science solutions to building and maintaining models in production.
Experience in building and running machine learning models end-to-end; you will own your models, ensuring they run smoothly in production and are continuously optimised.
Experience with MLFlow for model tracking and lifecycle management is desirable.
Hands-on experience with data engineering tools and platforms; a background in Databricks is highly valued.
Familiarity with NLP techniques is a plus, especially for customer segmentation and categorisation tasks.
Ability to wear multiple hats and thrive in a startup environment where flexibility and initiative are key.
Proficiency in German is plus.
Based in Germany/EU: We are unfortunately not able to sponsor visas - for this role, you will need to possess an existing EU/German work permit.



🛠️ The tools you will be using


Python
PySpark
Databricks
MLFlow
Model Serving Technologies
CI/CD Tools (e.g., Jenkins, Git)

About the New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt the best place to order what you need, be it groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, or other goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!)

About The Marketing & Affordability Analytics Team

Our Marketing & Affordability Analytics team uncovers insights on growth opportunities and consumer experience. We partner with Product, Engineering and Business teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll collaborate with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals who take ownership of the business outcomes. As we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity, you’ll play a key role in establishing analytical expertise in various business domains.

About The Role

We’re looking for an awesome Staff Data Scientist in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. You will be the partner for the New Verticals business and act as the go-getter analytics expert of your domain. You’ll have an opportunity to make a domain-wide impact, by partnering with senior leaders closely and driving the action from the frontlines.

The scope of the role ranges from helping cross-functional teams use various data points to size the potential opportunities, identifying and measuring levers to help move essential metrics, leveraging your technical and analytical skills to tell stories about business performance and make recommendations, and aligning executives around what matters and why.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
6+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position
Expertise with SQL and statistical analysis using Python, R, or equivalent.
Strong know-how on experimentation techniques (A/B testing, causal inference) and hypothesis testing.
Ability to build intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence critical business decisions on senior leadership level, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Clear and concise communication with strong cross-functional partnership experience.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach independently.
Ability to work and communicate effectively in English.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Healthcare workers speak freely and our AI automatically generates the correct structured forms.

We are YC-funded and grow quickly. Our customers like Caritas, Contilia, and TÜV NORD create thousands of documentation records every single day.

Today speech recognition is primarily used as a “fun” gimmick for consumers, who set kitchen timers with their Alexa speaker. We build a completely new class of speech-powered applications, to supercharge the professional workforce. By focusing on individual workflows like healthcare or vehicle inspections, we create truly magical user experiences and save each user 30 minutes per day in administrative work. Don’t believe it? See for yourself in our 3-minute product demo (https://youtu.be/AlkVD4OwCQk).

The entire system is built in-house, giving us full control over the user experience, product design, NLP models, and speech recognition. Our custom speech recognition models already outperform Google with 10x lower error rates and we are just getting started!

If you ever wanted to work at the bleeding edge of product design, applied machine learning research, and MLOps, you should apply. You get to build products with daily user feedback, train AI models on real-world data, and ship to production on a daily basis.

At voize new software is deployed to production every 5h on average! We deploy new AI models every 24h and have one of the largest speech data sets for medical documentation.

Tasks

We’re looking for team members who enjoy talking to customers, iterating & shipping quickly.

As an ML developer, you will take core responsibility for the design, training, evaluation, and deployment of our deep learning models in the space of speech recognition and NLP.

You should be comfortable with the following tech stack


Python
Deep Learning Frameworks (preferably PyTorch)
Speech recognition or NLP & Transformer models
Typical Software Engineering skills like Git, Docker, etc
Bonus: Kotlin, React Native / Typescript



Team Work & Personal Skills:


You have to be able to work in a team, communicate clearly, take ownership over your work and share feedback with your teammates.
You need to feel empathy for the user and have a deep passion for great product experiences. You will talk to users, listen to their feedback, understand their daily challenges, and translate those insights into product decisions.
You need great time management skills and be self-sufficient. Your colleges have to be able to rely on you.



Language & Region


You need to be able to speak German fluently. (especially to talk to customers)

Interview Process

To help us determine that we are both a great fit for each other and are happy to change the world together for years to come, we run a 4 stage interview process. This process is usually completed in 2-3 weeks.


First Call with the founder (Remote):



This is a more informal video call with you and one of our founders, to get to know you, and share more details on the role. Together we want to determine if this role is a great fit for you and get a basic understanding of your personal interests and technical & soft skills.


Technical Interview with CTO (Remote):



In this video call, we want to learn more about your technical skills and past projects you have worked on.

The best way to impress us is by showing us a project you’ve built and walking us through the 2 hardest technical/design decisions you had to make.

Mostly, we want to know that you can code and ship fairly involved systems, and speak to them with clarity on the details. This tends to be a good indication that an engineer had strong ownership and showed autonomy in making a product or technical decisions.


Pair Programming Challenge (Remote):



At this stage, we want to show you the kind of challenges we are facing on a daily basis. In a pair programming setting, you will get access to a portion of our system and will debug an Error we’ve introduced or build a prototype of a new feature.


Onboarding



If you and our team both see a great culture and technical fit, we will send you a job offer and walk you through our onboarding process.

In your first week, you will ship your very own first feature to production! We will prepare a great first task, help you along the way and celebrate the release and direct user feedback.

We are looking for a (Senior) Data Scientist (Analytics) to join Wolt’s Courier & Logistics mission!

As the international side of the Doordash business, Wolt is active in 27 countries outside of the US and growing. Together with functional and cross-functional partners, you’ll tackle highly impactful challenges to craft the most-loved platform for gig workers, and empower local businesses with our robust logistics system. Ultimately, your efforts will connect consumers to everything they desire.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, you’ll dive deep into our data to tackle crucial business challenges. You will diagnose problem areas, develop new metrics, design experiments, uncover foundational causal relationships in our data, and influence strategic decisions. This role combines scientific expertise with stakeholder engagement, positioning you at the forefront of driving business outcomes. You will work closely with Product, Engineering, Design, and Operations teams to guide measurement strategies and tactical decisions, helping to expand the Wolt platform globally.

In this role you will use data to optimize and quantify the onboarding of couriers and help us to reach the right number of couriers in the most efficient way to maximize the business outcome.

From day one you will work on questions such as


What’s the business impact of one missing courier or a delay in the onboarding process?
How do referrals impact courier performance and retention?
What are the main blockers in the onboarding funnel and how can we improve them?
Do automated processes perform better or worse than manual ones and how much so?


You will be the expert from the data side to answer the questions and own exploration, tracking, and experimentation.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs in Berlin, Helsinki and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Germany, Finland and Sweden. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations

A typical candidate for this role has over 3 years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting and a degree in mathematics, statistics, economics, computer science, or a related field.

We value the following attributes in an applicant:


proven track record in using data science to solve business or research problems
expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation, and regression analysis using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent
proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets
good communication skills and the ability to explain complex topics to a technical and non-technical audience
good stakeholder management


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

Engelhart was founded in 2013 by BTG Pactual Group as a commodities trading company. Its business model is “asset light” and highly diversified – giving it the ability to adapt effectively and nimbly to changing market conditions. It has assembled successful multidisciplinary teams, leveraging advanced fundamental analysis with deep quantitative and weather research capabilities. Its activities are underpinned by strong risk management practices and by powerful technology and operational excellence. Its exceptional teams have diverse global backgrounds and decades of experience, and are driven by a highly collaborative culture, across products and competencies.

In 2024, Engelhart acquired Trailstone, a global energy trading and technology company. The acquisition provides Engelhart with new expertise, analytics and proprietary technology which is used to provide risk management and optimisation services to manage the intermittency of renewable power generation for its client base. The acquisition also expanded Engelhart’s capabilities into physical natural gas across North America.

Its talented and experienced individuals work together according to its four company values: be bold, be collaborative, be proactive, be your best.

Software Engineer, Python

About the Role

We are looking for an experienced back-end Python software engineer to join our growing London office. This role will join the Trading & Commercial Development Team, developing best in class back-end services and microservices for our renewables trading platform, with Python.

The team is building a world-class product to help us scale and bring renewables to many more power markets in the world, while trading many more smaller electricity assets. This project is expanding at pace, following Trailstone’s merger with Engelhart Commodities Trading Partners. As a result, this role will be joining an international team with tangible impact on our platform's success from day one.

This will be a full-time role, owning the following responsibilities:


Design, develop and maintain containerised services for auction-based renewables trading.
Work in a cross-functional team with engineers, business analysts, traders, data engineers and data scientists.
Stay up to date with the latest trends in technology and continuously improve our code base, systems, and processes.
Mentor junior members in the team by emphasising code quality and conducting pull requests and code reviews.


About You

This person will be a seasoned developer, experienced working with time-sensitive hybrid-cloud systems, in order to deliver immediate impact to our growing renewables trading platform. This person will be working closely with commercial stakeholders on a regular basis, so experience collaborating with non-technical staff will help set someone up for success.

We believe the following essential skills & experiences will best set someone up for success in this role, therefore will be prioritising the following:


Significant relevant Python experience.
Strong knowledge of object-oriented, functional and asynchronous programming and design patterns.
Substantial SQL experience and understanding of relational database fundamentals.
A passion for delivering clean code and working with a test-driven mindset.
An appreciation of working in a hybrid-cloud and container-driven architecture (partly on-premise and partly AWS).
Domain knowledge in the energy or financial sector is highly desirable.
Desirable, but not essential: Experience developing services in C#




Our Tech Stack

Our tech stack includes Python (FastAPI, Pandas), AWS (ECS, Aurora), Redis, Docker, Atlassian (Jira, Bitbucket), SQL Server, C# and more.

Locations

This role can be based in either our Berlin or our London office, following the preference of the individual. You can find our office addresses on our website.

We believe in inclusivity and are therefore dedicated to ensuring all employees – across gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, life experience, background and more – feel welcome and included in the company. We promote diversity because we believe it is essential to our ability to think holistically.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high-quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That's where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Aignostics, you will play a crucial role in shaping the technical direction and architecture of our ML platform and infrastructure. You will work hand in hand with fellow engineering leads at Aignostics, as well as collaborators in academia and industry. Your expertise will be instrumental in driving technical excellence across all ML engineering teams, ensuring we deliver high-quality, scalable solutions that transform complex biomedical data into actionable insights for cancer research and diagnostics. You will report directly to the Head of ML Engineering.

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse and growing team of 100+ software engineers, applied scientists, biologists and pathologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a dedicated community that works in an agile, supportive and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup, you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take on significant responsibilities and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Where your expertise is needed


Steer: Define and drive the technical architecture and system design principles for our AI platform and infrastructure. Work in close collaboration with engineering leads to build flexible frameworks and systems for model training, evaluation and inference across different pathology applications.
Consult: Guide the CTO office, product management and fellow engineering leads through complex decisions by providing expert consultation on feasibility, architecture, trade-offs and risk mitigation strategies, while ensuring alignment with our technical vision.
Coordinate: Foster technical alignment across teams by establishing shared architectural principles and best practices, facilitating cross-team design reviews to enable consistent decision-making across domains.
Lead: Champion technical excellence by leading strategic initiatives that modernize our architecture and reduce technical debt while measuring and improving our technical health metrics.
Educate: Elevate the technical capabilities of our engineering staff through structured mentoring, workshops and establishing comprehensive technical guidelines that enable teams to make better design decisions.
Advocate: Drive innovation by evaluating emerging technologies, leading proof-of-concept initiatives and building support for strategic technical investments that advance our engineering capabilities while ensuring measurable business value.


What We Are Looking For


Solid foundations: Advanced degree in a relevant field or extensive work experience.
Proven experience: 8+ years of industry experience, with at least 2 years as Staff Engineer or an equivalent role.
Excellence in execution: Proven track record of driving technical excellence and innovation.

At Deliveroo, we have a world-class data and science organisation with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making.




We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. For example, how can we connect restaurants, riders and customers most efficiently in order to deliver food as quickly as possible? How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind?




These are just some of the tough problems we are solving at Deliveroo. There is no challenge that cannot be yours; the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers at Deliveroo belong to an expert, thoughtful, and active community with guest lecturers, a robust technical review process, a career progression framework, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things.




 




The Role 




As an Operational Research Scientist, you will play a crucial role in developing, implementing, and maintaining cutting-edge products that leverage optimization techniques. Your responsibilities will involve engineering sophisticated operational research algorithms, as well as refining and updating existing systems. 




In this team, you will develop the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo’s delivery network. You will work in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. The team has independence and works on some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants. We evaluate the performance of all our decision-making machines through our world-class experimentation platform.




You will report into a ML/OR Manager. This is a hybrid role that will be based in London.




 




You will:





Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real-time delays.


Enhance our simulation capabilities to more accurately predict the effects of algorithmic changes on our delivery network.


Optimise consumer and rider fees.





Also, you will work alongside people who work on:





The consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes.


Detecting fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants.


Assisting restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish.


Creating an ML platform to improve our ML and optimisation capabilities.





 




Requirements:





You are someone who knows the fundamentals of operational research and when they should be applied through a relevant PhD or work experience.


Proven experience in developing and applying optimization models, algorithms, and metaheuristic techniques in a logistics or supply chain context.


You can translate fuzzy logistics and delivery problems or objectives into a well-thought-out algorithmic solution. You get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.


Strong programming skills in one of the languages such as Python, Rust, C, C++, or Java, with a focus on algorithm design rather than software engineering.


Experience in combinatorial optimisation problems.


A bias to simplicity, where you care most about achieving impact.





Nice to haves: 





Experience in solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) and/or building large scale delivery network simulations


Experience in discrete event simulations


Experience in any of the following areas: algorithms and data structures, parallel and distributed computing, high-performance computing 





Why Deliveroo




Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.




We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & Benefits




At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




Diversity




At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.




We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed.

About The Role:




They are looking for a data scientist to work on the betting and prediction side of their business, helping them to improve their ability to predict match outcomes. This role involves researching ways in which the modelling approaches they use to predict football matches can be improved, and then turning those insights into practical modelling solutions that they can deploy to production.




You will have flexibility to work from home one day a week, and they aren't too fussy about the exact hours you work each day. But please note they are not considering remote candidates at the moment.




Essential Requirements:

Strong problem solving skills, with an ability to proactively identify challenges and propose solutions
Interest in football and betting/prediction problems
An ability to make pragmatic and sensible choices about what data analysis and modelling approaches to use – you can judge when it’s right to obsess about the details, and when it’s right to ship an MVP as fast as possible.
A flair for communicating statistical analyses to both technical and non-technical audiences
Experience with statistical analysis and predictive modelling - you don’t need to be an expert in any one area, but you need to know what techniques and tools are available, and understand the trade-offs of using different approaches
Experience with SQL and relational databases – you can quickly understand a new dataset, perform exploratory analysis, identify data quality issues, and take pragmatic decisions about how to handle imperfect data
Some programming experience, preferably with Python.




For senior candidates:




More experienced candidates will have the opportunity to take on more responsibility, leading projects and helping set the direction of the research. They are looking for candidates who can think strategically and make pragmatic decisions about where they should focus their efforts, and what technical approaches they should use to get the modelling ideas onto production. In addition to the requirements above, this means you also have:




3+ years of practical data science experience
Project management skills, including an ability to make sensible value judgements about where the team should spend time
An extensive knowledge of statistical methods and machine learning techniques
Strong programming skills, ideally with Python
Experience working with other data scientists on a collaborative codebase
Experience of deploying models to production, ideally in AWS or another cloud environment

We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & BenefitsAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




DiversityAt Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.




We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know.

Companies spend millions of dollars to store terabytes of data in data lakehouses, but only leverage a fraction of it for predictive tasks. This is because traditional machine learning is slow and time consuming, taking months to perform feature engineering, build training pipelines, and achieve acceptable performance.

At Kumo, we are building a machine learning platform for data lakehouses, enabling data scientists to train powerful Graph Neural Net models directly on their relational data, with only a few lines of declarative syntax known as Predictive Query Language. The Kumo platform enables users to build models a dozen times faster, and achieve better model accuracy than traditional approaches.

As a Data Scientist for EMEA, you will be a technical liaison for Kumo’s customers and prospects in the EMEA region. Your objective is to discover the technical needs of customers and showcase how Kumo can address them (or explain why you think it won’t). With this information, you will craft and tell a story of how Kumo can deliver value to their organization.

Together with the customer and Account Manager, you will put together a plan to solve the customer’s machine learning problems using Kumo. You will leverage your industry knowledge and data science expertise to help the customer craft the solution architecture and machine learning approach for their use cases, and guide them to achieve technical wins. You will maintain relationships with technical champions, ensuring continued success of existing models as well as expansion to new use cases.

The Value You Will Add:


Be a Kumo platform superuser - understand the product in and out and how it should be used to solve customer problems.
Lead the technical discovery to understand the alignment between what Kumo offers and prospective customer expectations.
Conduct product demos of Kumo solving ML problems in a variety of verticals, including finance/fraud, growth/marketing, personalization/commerce, and forecasting/optimization.
Guide the customer to achieve meaningful wins on high-impact ML problems, by leveraging your problem-solving skills, data science knowledge, and industry experience.
Be hands-on, to help customers overcome challenges they may encounter in achieving sufficient model performance, or integrating Kumo into their production systems.
Lead architecture reviews and security assessments.
Maintain meaningful relationships with technical influencers and champions within ML teams, both pre and post-sale.
Educate current Kumo users on how to successfully use our product, best practices, etc. so that they increase usage across a larger and larger number of internal workloads.
Provide market and customer feedback to the Product and Engineering team to refine feature specifications and the product roadmap.
Create broader processes for each customer to go through to ensure we can drive repeatable successes in PoCs.
Generate Kumo platform educational materials to disseminate amongst current users or prospects.


Your Foundation:


Someone who finds genuine satisfaction in solving customer ML problems and helping them deliver value to the business.
5+ years of relevant professional experience working with external customers in deploying AI/ML/data science solutions in production for customers.
Proficiency with ML and data science fundamentals, at the level of a bachelors/graduate program.
Persuasive communication – ability to present, speak, demo well to customer stakeholders and convince them to partner with Kumo!
Self-starter, motivative, resourceful and persistent: demonstrated ability to structure complex problems, take the initiative, and identify creative solutions to deliver outcomes in the face of obstacles.
Knowledge of common data science tools around SQL-based data warehousing (eg. Snowflake, Databricks, DBT), BI tools (eg. Tableau, Looker), workflow orchestration, and ML Ops.
Excellent spoken and written English skills.
Fluency with scripting in Python.
Ability to work effectively across time zones. Teammates will be located from PT to CET time zones. Customers will be in GMT/CET, while occasionally as far as SGT.

More About Carbon Re

We don’t draw a specific line between engineering and research teams. We operate as one cohesive unit, sharing tech stack, knowledge, and objectives. Our focus spans fundamental ML research to commercial-grade software development, offering diverse learning and impact opportunities.

Immediate action for long-term impact. Due to the cumulative https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing#IPCC_usage effect, one tonne of carbon saved today will help us meet global temperature targets as much as two tonnes saved in 2050. Immediate carbon reduction has a more profound effect on global temperature goals than future efforts. Our solutions prioritize immediate operational improvements for significant climate impact. We understand the urgency of now.

We value diversity, equity, and inclusivity. With a diverse range of nationalities and a range of backgrounds represented in our small team, we are building an inclusive environment where our people can bring their authentic selves to work, be respected for who they are and the exceptional work they do. We welcome and actively encourage applications from all sections of society and are committed to offering equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, disability, age, citizenship, or any other basis. We see our diversity as an asset as we tackle challenging problems through technology.

We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our iwocaPay team

iwocaPay works with sellers to offer innovative Trade Credit and Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) solutions for business customers. Those sellers are essential to our success, as we need them to offer iwocaPay to their customers, who in turn use us to spread the cost of their purchase, for improving cash flow and operational flexibility.

The Company

Fast, flexible finance empowers small businesses to manage their cash flow better and seize opportunities - making their business and the economy stronger as a whole. At iwoca, we do just that. We help businesses get the funds they need, when they need it, often within minutes. We’ve already made several billion in funding available to more than 100,000 businesses since we launched in 2012, and positioned ourselves as a leading Fintech in Europe.

Our mission is to finance one million businesses. We’ll get there by continuing to make our finance ever more relevant and accessible to more businesses by combining cutting-edge technology, data science, and a 5-star customer service.

The function

iwoca's Data Scientists specialise in Supervised Machine Learning, Statistical Inference and Exploratory Statistics, focusing on tabular and time series data. Our work emphasises quantitative predictions through the analysis of conditional probabilities and expectations, using medium-sized datasets.

The team

At iwoca, we’re proud to nurture an entrepreneurial spirit within our teams. This is especially true of iwocaPay, a fast-growing start-up within the business, now with a dedicated team of more than 30 people. With iwocaPay, we’ve created a trade credit solution that has already provided thousands of buyers across the UK with the flexibility to manage cash flow while growing their purchasing power. Our team continues to innovate and expand, driving iwocaPay’s mission to make credit available where it's needed most.

The role

As a Data Scientist within our iwocaPay team, you’ll develop insights for our credit assessment model. Your role will involve evaluating the model, identifying key areas for improvement, and using untapped features to enhance accuracy and reduce friction for customers.

You’ll work collaboratively with Data Scientists across iwoca, sharing expertise with a peer group to deepen your knowledge and apply it to iwocaPay. Additionally, you’ll design and analyse tests and build statistical models to help us reach a broader range of customers.

The Projects

In this role, you'll tackle a few high-impact projects within your first 90 days, designed to drive the evolution of iwocaPay’s risk model and enhance our data capabilities:


Model Evaluation & Improvement: Begin by immersing yourself in our current model to assess its strengths and identify areas for enhancement. You’ll focus on the model’s relevance to iwocaPay and the data sources supporting it.
Data Feature Expansion: Conduct a detailed data assessment to identify new features that could improve model precision and reliability. This includes testing additional data points and exploring off-the-shelf alternatives to sensitive personal data, which add unnecessary friction to the loan application process.
Prototype Testing & Iteration: Start developing and testing initial model iterations, refining as you go. Investigate supplementary data sources, including ecommerce insights, to enrich the model’s accuracy and expand its potential applications within iwocaPay.
Strategic Data Science Influence: Beyond immediate model improvements, you’ll play a pivotal role in shaping iwocaPay’s data science roadmap. By identifying emerging data science techniques and championing best practices, you’ll guide how we apply data science to add deeper value across our offerings, setting the foundation for innovative, scalable solutions that drive future growth.


The Requirements

Essential:


Strong problem-solving skills in probability and statistics, ideally from a quantitative background (e.g., Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, or similar fields).
Proficiency with data manipulation and modelling tools, e.g. pandas, statsmodels, R.
Experience with scientific computing and tooling, e.g. NumPy, SciPy, R, Matlab, Mathematica, BLAS.
Self-starter with ability to work autonomously and efficiently manage projects end-to-end.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to adjust your communication style and technical detail based on the audience.


Bonus:


Experience building machine learning models from scratch (e.g. creating custom optimisers)
Advanced knowledge of stochastic processes and related mathematical techniques.
Experience with Bayesian analysis.
Experience with Python (our primary programming language).
Knowledge of financial concepts (e.g. calculations with deterministic cash flows).


The salary

We expect to pay from £70,000 - £100,000 for this role. But, we’re open-minded, so definitely include your salary goals with your application. We routinely benchmark salaries against market rates, and run quarterly performance and salary reviews.

The culture

At iwoca, we prioritise a culture of learning, growth, and support, and invest in the professional development of our team members. We value thought and skill diversity, and encourage you to explore new areas of interest to help us innovate and improve our products and services.

The offices

We put a lot of effort into making iwoca a brilliant place to work:


Offices in London, Leeds, and Frankfurt with plenty of drinks and snacks
Events and clubs, like bingo, comedy nights, yoga classes, football, etc.


The Benefits


Flexible working.
Medical insurance from Vitality, including discounted gym membership
A private GP service (separate from Vitality) for you, your partner, and your dependents.
25 days’ holiday, an extra day off for your birthday, the option to buy or sell an additional five days of annual leave, and unlimited unpaid leave

How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?


What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?


How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?


What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?


How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?


What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?


How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?





The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.




Requirements





A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)


Experience conducting A/B experiments


Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences


A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset

We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & BenefitsAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




DiversityAt Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.




We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed.

Our values

We spend at least as much time with our co-workers as we do with our closest friends + family; if we intend to do the most important and challenging work of our lives, it’s important that these folks energize us, support us, inspire us, and push us to do our best work.

This is what you can expect of your teammates at Flagler:


Persistence + ownership of outcomes: We wear many hats and aren’t afraid to run through walls to solve hard problems.
Personal + professional growth: We push ourselves to learn new things and embrace challenges, even if it means that we sometimes fail.
Don’t take things personally: We value and react quickly to constructive feedback.
Speed is our ally: In the fast-paced world of startups, we understand the value of moving swiftly. We thrive on the adrenaline of working rapidly.
Be Right: We are highly detailed oriented and try to be right, a lot.


Hiring Process

Due to the high volume of applications, we only reach out to candidates selected for interviews. We do not have online leetcode assessments as an initial filter, so we only reach out to very few candidates for initial introduction.
