Hostelworld Group, the global hostel-focussed online booking platform, inspires adventurous minds to meet the world and come back with life-changing stories to tell. Our customers are not your average tourists, they crave cultural connection and unique experiences that we make possible by providing an unbeatable selection of hostels in unmissable locations – all in the palm of their hand.

It is the social nature and community feel of hostels and their environment, that enable travellers to embrace journeys of discovery, adventure and meaning. We have more than 13 million reviews across 17,800 hostels in more than 179 countries, making the brand the leading online hub for social travel. The website operates in 19 different languages and our mobile app in 13 languages.

Founded in 1999 and headquartered in Dublin, Hostelworld has a growing, high-calibre team of 230 people within Technology, Product, Global Markets, HR, Finance & Legal and Marketing Teams across our Dublin, London, Porto, Shanghai and Sydney offices.

LOCATION🌍

This role is based in Portugal. We have an office hub in Porto available for those who prefer a hybrid model where you can spend time with colleagues in-person. You will need to be able to commute to our office hub as required from time to time.




THE ROLE & THE TEAM👨🏽‍🤝‍👨🏼

During 2020, Hostelworld pivoted from a more traditional functional CMO/CPO/CTO organisation to a ‘full ownership” growth team plus platform team model. More specifically, we established four growth teams to cover all consumer /hostel facing Apps and channels that reported into the CPO; and a separate CTO organisation that became responsible for supplying and maintaining common core services (such as inventory pricing, availability and checkout) via APIs to these four growth teams. Each of these four growth teams comprise resources that report into the CPO and dedicated resources drawn from the engineering function (developers, QA resources) and analytics function. Collectively, these four growth teams comprise ~ 50 headcount and are wholly accountable for their KPIs and roadmaps




We currently have four growth teams and four further central/support teams as follows;

Paid performance team : responsible for growing and optimising our paid web channels, including (web) landing page optimisation
Core team : responsible for our progressive web app (PWA Website), our organic web channels such as SEO, and more generally our core OTA funnel performance
Mobile/Social team : responsible for our iOS and Android Apps, including paid and organic downloads, CRM strategy and more generally our social network and event management (LinkUps) platforms
Supply team : responsible for all our hostel facing platforms and tools, supporting our two sided marketplace through collaboration with our customer facing teams and leading on our inventory, availability and rates position[LR1]
Product Design (Central) team : responsible for defining and implementing a uniform User Interface/Experience design language across our consumer and supplier facing Apps, consistent with our Mission and Brand
Content and Creative (Central) team : responsible for defining and leading the creative direction for Hostelworld, delivering content primarily through the four Growth teams above but also supporting the wider business needs with copywriting, content writing, graphic design and video production assets
Product and Technology Operations (Central) team : primarily responsible for driving alignment and coordination across the Growth and Technology teams quarterly roadmap planning process; and managing vendor spend across these two teams which accounts for the vast majority of non Wages and Salaries expenditure across the company

Our powerhouse of products — including spending, saving, investing, exchanging, travelling, and more — help our 50+ million customers get more from their money every day.

As we continue our lightning-fast growth,‌ 2 things are essential to our success: our people and our culture.

Hostelworld Group, the global hostel-focussed online booking platform, inspires adventurous minds to meet the world and come back with life-changing stories to tell. Our customers are not your average tourists, they crave cultural connection and unique experiences that we make possible by providing an unbeatable selection of hostels in unmissable locations – all in the palm of their hand.

It is the social nature and community feel of hostels and their environment, that enable travellers to embrace journeys of discovery, adventure and meaning. We have more than 13 million reviews across 17,800 hostels in more than 179 countries, making the brand the leading online hub for social travel. The website operates in 19 different languages and our mobile app in 13 languages.

Founded in 1999 and headquartered in Dublin, Hostelworld has a growing, high-calibre team of 230 people within Technology, Product, Global Markets, HR, Finance & Legal and Marketing Teams across our Dublin, London, Porto, Shanghai and Sydney offices. Hostelworld is listed on the London Stock Exchange and Dublin Euronext. You can read more about our story here.




LOCATION🌍

This role is based in Portugal. We have an office hub in Porto available for those who prefer a hybrid model where you can spend time with colleagues in-person. You will need to be able to commute to our office hub as required from time to time.




THE ROLE & TEAM👨🏽‍🤝‍👨🏼

During 2020, Hostelworld pivoted from a more traditional functional CMO/CPO/CTO organisation to a ‘full ownership” growth team plus platform team model. More specifically, we established four growth teams to cover all consumer /hostel facing Apps and channels that reported into the CPO; and a separate CTO organisation that became responsible for supplying and maintaining common core services (such as inventory pricing, availability and checkout) via APIs to these four growth teams. Each of these four growth teams comprise resources that report into the CPO and dedicated resources drawn from the engineering function (developers, QA resources) and analytics function. Collectively, these four growth teams comprise ~ 50 headcount and are wholly accountable for their KPIs and roadmaps




We currently have four growth teams and four further central/support teams as follows;

Paid performance team : responsible for growing and optimising our paid web channels, including (web) landing page optimisation
Core team : responsible for our progressive web app (PWA Website), our organic web channels such as SEO, and more generally our core OTA funnel performance
Mobile/Social team : responsible for our iOS and Android Apps, including paid and organic downloads, CRM strategy and more generally our social network and event management (LinkUps) platforms
Supply team : responsible for all our hostel facing platforms and tools, supporting our two sided marketplace through collaboration with our customer facing teams and leading on our inventory, availability and rates position
Product Design (Central) team : responsible for defining and implementing a uniform User Interface/Experience design language across our consumer and supplier facing Apps, consistent with our Mission and Brand
Content and Creative (Central) team : responsible for defining and leading the creative direction for Hostelworld, delivering content primarily through the four Growth teams above but also supporting the wider business needs with copywriting, content writing, graphic design and video production assets
Product and Technology Operations (Central) team : primarily responsible for driving alignment and coordination across the Growth and Technology teams quarterly roadmap planning process; and managing vendor spend across these two teams which accounts for the vast majority of non Wages and Salaries expenditure across the company
Customer Service (Support) team : responsible for handling all consumer support queries, mostly via webform/chat and email across 19 languages.

To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.

This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do


Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events


Who you are


You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an experienced Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

Moller - Maersk,Greater Póvoa de Varzim Area,"The world is facing a climate emergency. At Maersk we see it as our obligation – as an industry leader in logistics and with the resources available to us – to do all we can to get to net zero operations as fast as possible and to help our customers decarbonize their global supply chains end to end.

As a key player in an industry responsible for 3.5 billion tons of annual direct emissions, A.P. Moller - Maersk (Maersk) is committed to leading the decarbonization of logistics and taking responsibility to be part of the solution, enabling a green and just transition.

Our Energy Transition technology team is at the heart of this work, using Advanced Technology and Development Techniques to rapidly develop and continuously deploy the systems we need to identify, track and reduce our emissions.

Advanced Technology

This is a greenfield build, and our intent is to build a system that can rapidly make a difference now and that will still be relevant in 2040 and beyond.

We are currently seeking Python and PySpark software engineers to enhance our ability to exploit Maestro 2.0 and in particular the Data Plane/ Pipe Dream.

Advanced Development Techniques

We run a continuous delivery pipeline which is currently deploying to production 20-30 times a day and the ability to work with our advanced development techniques is an essential part of the role.

As a member of our team, you will pair daily with other software engineers using Extreme Programming (XP) methodologies, such as pair programming, test-driven development, and continuous integration and delivery.

Our Team spans multiple geographies with a focus in Portugal, India and Copenhagen. We have developed methodologies to enable effective remote working and, although office facilities are available when needed or if you prefer the office environment, the norm is for people to work from home.

We are looking for people with the following skills and approach to development:


Have experience in the technologies we are using, ideally Python, PySpark, Great Expectations and Data Plane/ Pipe Dream. Knowledge of functional programming in particular Elixir or aligned languages such as Erlang or Ruby is beneficial.
Have knowledge of extreme programming practices/ values such as pair programming. A Commitment to Test Driven Design is essential.
Have relevant domain knowledge such as logistics, financial services, or energy. We are particularly interested in experience of quantitative modelling, energy trading and oil/ liquids/ green fuel commodities markets.
