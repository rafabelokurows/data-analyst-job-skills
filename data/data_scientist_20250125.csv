We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion is seeking a Finance Data Scientist to join our growing team. In this role, you'll work at the intersection of Finance, Product, and Go-to-Market, using data to drive Notion's growth and success. The ideal candidate is a strong communicator with a growth mindset who collaborates effectively and focuses on action and impact.

Your work will translate initiatives from both our self-serve and sales-assisted businesses into tangible revenue outcomes. You'll partner with the Strategic Finance team to identify growth opportunities, develop insights that deepen our understanding of the business, and forecast future performance.

What You'll Achieve


Partner with Strategic Finance to understand the drivers of our business and accelerate Notion's growth
Deliver proactive insights on key business drivers, financial trends, and potential areas for growth or optimization
Build and refine data science forecasts for both short-term and long-range planning
Empower others through self-service tools and reports that drive awareness and understanding of key metrics
Work with Data Engineering to build core data models that power operational and exploratory data analyses



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have 2+ years of experience in analytics and data science, with a track record of collaborating with finance, business operations, growth, or go-to-market teams
You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)
You have experience building predictive models and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness
You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion is seeking a Finance Data Scientist to join our growing team. In this role, you'll work at the intersection of Finance, Product, and Go-to-Market, using data to drive Notion's growth and success. The ideal candidate is a strong communicator with a growth mindset who collaborates effectively and focuses on action and impact.

Your work will translate initiatives from both our self-serve and sales-assisted businesses into tangible revenue outcomes. You'll partner with the Strategic Finance team to identify growth opportunities, develop insights that deepen our understanding of the business, and forecast future performance.

What You'll Achieve


Partner with Strategic Finance to understand the drivers of our business and accelerate Notion's growth
Deliver proactive insights on key business drivers, financial trends, and potential areas for growth or optimization
Build and refine data science forecasts for both short-term and long-range planning
Empower others through self-service tools and reports that drive awareness and understanding of key metrics
Work with Data Engineering to build core data models that power operational and exploratory data analyses



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have 2+ years of experience in analytics and data science, with a track record of collaborating with finance, business operations, growth, or go-to-market teams
You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)
You have experience building predictive models and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness
You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

Fast-growing measurement company looking for a Data Scientist with 3-5 years of experience to work with our Data Science team to help build the AU and drive our measurement product forward.

Who We Are

Adelaide is the leader in one of the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising: attention metrics.

Since 2020, we’ve been a trusted measurement partner for 40% of Fortune 50 companies. They rely on our metric, AU, to maximize the effectiveness of media spend. AU is “the attention economy's most widely recognized metric,” according to Adweek, and we swept the measurement category in the 2024 Adexchanger awards.

Our business is growing rapidly—we’ve doubled revenue in just 18 months and grew our team by 45% last year. Earlier this year, in partnership with The New York Times, we launched Adelaide for Publishers, the next step in our vision to create a more fair and equitable marketplace for media.

Adelaide is backed by prominent investors such as Human Ventures (Joe Marchese), Aperiam Ventures (Joe Zawadzki & Eric Franchi), WGI (Jonah Goodhart), and Irwin Gotlieb.

While we have an office in NYC, we’re very remote-friendly and support flexible work arrangements.

How We Operate

We are a team of action-oriented doers; management rolls up their sleeves to contribute daily. Our culture is rooted in curiosity and loosely held but rigorously vetted opinions; everyone is encouraged to contribute to planning and strategy.

Position Overview

This position reports to the Director of Data Science; it will help to continue pushing forward the underlying models and data sets that create the AU, and work closely with product and client services team members to develop new data products and methodologies in support of all areas of the business.

In this role, you will be joining a team of other data scientists and data engineers, and work with people across the organization to shape Adelaide’s data into a clear and concise story. You’ll be responsible for working with hundreds of millions of data points a day, quickly iterating on optimization methods that further advertising effectiveness and fuel the world’s first attention-based optimization platform. Day-to-day activities range from identifying and exploring new data sources, to training new models and iterating on existing models, to improving our codebase and pipelines.

This is a fully remote position within the United States, with opportunities to connect with colleagues at our New York office.

What You'll Learn

An important part of our culture is continuing education and the sharing of ideas. We offer:


A large network of investors and advisors for you to access that will help your team succeed

At Obviously AI, our vision is to turn every company into an AI company. We do this by providing businesses with access to world class, on-demand data science talent that helps them solve real business problems. On the back end, we empower data scientists with a set of internal groundbreaking tools to help them deliver results in minutes, not months.

We're a small, scrappy group of people with a strong bent toward failing fast, bias for action and attention to detail. We're focused on doing the best work of our lives and believe in having a healthy separation of work and life. We keep working hours flexible and are building a team with most of us located in San Francisco, CA.

Obviously AI is backed by some of the top venture capital firms in the US, and you'll be on the ground floor of a fast-growing company with a big mission.


About You

As a data scientist, you will be on the ground floor of an incredible opportunity to pair your R and Python mastery with industry's key and critical business challenges. Obviously AI is currently used by several companies across the globe and our users deeply love the speed, reliability and customer care that we provide.

You will have no shortage of interesting and exciting data science challenges that, when solved, can transform entire businesses around the world.

Our ideal candidate for this role is someone who really wants to get their hands dirty in a small, scrappy team. You should be excited about the idea of solving different data science challenges everyday, educating non-technical users with the right information by boiling down complex AI concepts into layman terms and leading with a lot of autonomy and agency. You'll report directly to the founders, you'll be a key proponent of Obviously AI's early success and have the equity (aka. ""skin in the game"") to make it worthwhile.

Fast-growing measurement company looking for a Data Scientist with 3-5 years of experience to work with our Data Science team to help build the AU and drive our measurement product forward.

Who We Are

Adelaide is the leader in one of the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising: attention metrics.

Since 2020, we’ve been a trusted measurement partner for 40% of Fortune 50 companies. They rely on our metric, AU, to maximize the effectiveness of media spend. AU is “the attention economy's most widely recognized metric,” according to Adweek, and we swept the measurement category in the 2024 Adexchanger awards.

Our business is growing rapidly—we’ve doubled revenue in just 18 months and grew our team by 45% last year. Earlier this year, in partnership with The New York Times, we launched Adelaide for Publishers, the next step in our vision to create a more fair and equitable marketplace for media.

Adelaide is backed by prominent investors such as Human Ventures (Joe Marchese), Aperiam Ventures (Joe Zawadzki & Eric Franchi), WGI (Jonah Goodhart), and Irwin Gotlieb.

While we have an office in NYC, we’re very remote-friendly and support flexible work arrangements.

How We Operate

We are a team of action-oriented doers; management rolls up their sleeves to contribute daily. Our culture is rooted in curiosity and loosely held but rigorously vetted opinions; everyone is encouraged to contribute to planning and strategy.

Position Overview

This position reports to the Director of Data Science; it will help to continue pushing forward the underlying models and data sets that create the AU, and work closely with product and client services team members to develop new data products and methodologies in support of all areas of the business.

In this role, you will be joining a team of other data scientists and data engineers, and work with people across the organization to shape Adelaide’s data into a clear and concise story. You’ll be responsible for working with hundreds of millions of data points a day, quickly iterating on optimization methods that further advertising effectiveness and fuel the world’s first attention-based optimization platform. Day-to-day activities range from identifying and exploring new data sources, to training new models and iterating on existing models, to improving our codebase and pipelines.

This is a fully remote position within the United States, with opportunities to connect with colleagues at our New York office.

What You'll Learn

An important part of our culture is continuing education and the sharing of ideas. We offer:


A large network of investors and advisors for you to access that will help your team succeed
Mentorship from executives with decades of experience in adtech and media
Regular internal knowledge-sharing sessions
Education budget to accelerate your team’s development


Specifically, In This Role, You Will Learn


Gain a deep understanding of attention metrics and media quality measurement
Complex user interaction patterns and ML solutions to account for specialized data sets
Methods for processing and deriving insights from massive amounts of user experience signals
Best practices and collaborative product development in a fast-paced collaborative environment


Core Responsibilities

Work with our Data Science team, as well as Product and Customer Success, to shape Adelaide’s data into a clear and concise story
Help to formulate, develop, and optimize models in production

ABOUT BOSE

You know the moment. It’s the first notes of that song you love, the intro to your favorite movie, or simply the sound of someone you love saying “hello.” It’s in these moments that sound matters most.

At Bose, we believe sound is the most powerful force on earth. And we’ve dedicated ourselves to improving it for nearly 60 years. Ever since our founder, Dr. Amar Bose, bought a stereo system and thought, “I can make this better,” we’ve been relentlessly pushing forward to the next best thing.

Innovation is more than what we do. It’s who we are — constantly learning and constantly curious. We never stop imagining what better sound sounds like. We’re music fanatics and audio engineers. We’re explorers and inventors and dreamers. And we’re passionate down to our bones about making whatever you’re listening to a little more magical.

THE PROGRAM

We're looking for students to join our Co-Op Program who are obsessively curious about 'what's next'. You'll get hands on experience with our products and learn from the best of the best in the business. You will immerse yourself into Bose for 6 months and get the opportunity to grow the skills your learned in the classroom with hands on work experience. By the time you end your time with us, you will have been given the opportunity to truly make a real impact in the future of Bose and your career!

Opportunities don't stop at your day-to-day work. While you're getting an in depth look at your area of expertise, we'll expose you to other areas of the company. Our Co-Ops are given the opportunity to connect with senior leadership across the business to understand different perspectives at Bose. You'll network with other Co-Ops and colleagues to grow your network for the future!

Timeframe - July-December 2025

THE ROLE

Bose is about better sound, but better sound is just the beginning. We are about inventing new technologies that truly benefit people and creating a culture where innovation and teamwork are highly valued. Working at Bose, you are encouraged to question conventional thinking in the relentless quest to create products and experiences that change people's lives. Data science, ML, and analytics are crucial parts of this mission.

Imagine if one of the world’s leading biomedical investment firms (that’s also getting into other areas like climate tech) made decades of its notes, investment theses, competitive landscape maps, and track record available to an AI development team charged with creating an AI that could help to identify innovations worth funding. It’s the ultimate application of AI, so hard that it’s not possible today but might become possible in the coming five years. Today, are breaking down every step of the investment analysis process to build the AI agents that make sense. But the goal is nothing short of creating an AI that won’t miss any innovation work funding and can even re-underwrite a portfolio and call out when investments that once made sense no longer do due to new information. And we have access to just about any public data set and many private ones that are available with subscription. But more importantly, we have the chance to build a system that will hybridize with a proven team of analysts and investors who is committed to mentoring the AIs we are developing, flagging their errors and teaching how they would get to the right answer. Anyone interested in developing great AIs knows that this last ingredient is key. If you have the right skills and ideas and truly embrace a team-approach, come join our sandboxes. Our work feels like play, and when our investments succeed, people live longer, healthier lives. Doesn’t get better than that.
