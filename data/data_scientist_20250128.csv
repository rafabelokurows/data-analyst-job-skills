About the New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt the best place to order what you need, be it groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, or other goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!)

About The Marketing & Affordability Analytics Team

Our Marketing & Affordability Analytics team uncovers insights on growth opportunities and consumer experience. We partner with Product, Engineering and Business teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll collaborate with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals who take ownership of the business outcomes. As we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity, you’ll play a key role in establishing analytical expertise in various business domains.

About The Role

We’re looking for an awesome Staff Data Scientist in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. You will be the partner for the New Verticals business and act as the go-getter analytics expert of your domain. You’ll have an opportunity to make a domain-wide impact, by partnering with senior leaders closely and driving the action from the frontlines.

The scope of the role ranges from helping cross-functional teams use various data points to size the potential opportunities, identifying and measuring levers to help move essential metrics, leveraging your technical and analytical skills to tell stories about business performance and make recommendations, and aligning executives around what matters and why.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
6+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position
Expertise with SQL and statistical analysis using Python, R, or equivalent.
Strong know-how on experimentation techniques (A/B testing, causal inference) and hypothesis testing.
Ability to build intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence critical business decisions on senior leadership level, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Clear and concise communication with strong cross-functional partnership experience.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach independently.
Ability to work and communicate effectively in English.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Consumer Analytics at Wolt

As the name Consumer Analytics implies, this team aims to provide reliable data insights that drive informed decision-making, empower Wolt's product organization, and foster a data-driven culture through collaboration and education, ultimately inspiring teams and building value for the Consumer group.

About The Payments Domain

Payment Group at Wolt is building a world-class payment infrastructure for the best customer experience. You’ll be part of the team working on a smooth, scalable, and secure checkout experience adapting to the many use cases of consumers.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, your role involves diving into our data to solve crucial business problems. The scope of this role ranges from diagnosing problem areas to identifying solutions to designing experiments and ultimately influencing decision-making. This is a rare, operational, and actionable data-driven experience. When you join this team, you will be driving action from the frontlines, rather than just doing yet another analytics role.

If you enjoy finding patterns amidst chaos, are excited to build from 0 to 1, and have experience using analytics to affect Payments, we're looking for someone like you!

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
5+ years of experience in a Data Analyst or Data Scientist position.
Experience with the Payments domain - we’ll pay lots of attention to this experience.
Expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing (A/B testing), and experimentation using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent.
Proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets.
Have prior experience building intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence business decisions, utilizing tools like Tableau, Mixpanel, Looker, or similar.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.<br><br><strong>Working in Product Development at Wolt<br><br></strong>At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.<br><br>The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.<br><br><strong>Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion<br><br></strong>We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.<br><br>Join us today to build Wolt together!<br><br>

We are looking for a (Senior) Data Scientist (Analytics) to join Wolt’s Courier & Logistics mission!

As the international side of the Doordash business, Wolt is active in 27 countries outside of the US and growing. Together with functional and cross-functional partners, you’ll tackle highly impactful challenges to craft the most-loved platform for gig workers, and empower local businesses with our robust logistics system. Ultimately, your efforts will connect consumers to everything they desire.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, you’ll dive deep into our data to tackle crucial business challenges. You will diagnose problem areas, develop new metrics, design experiments, uncover foundational causal relationships in our data, and influence strategic decisions. This role combines scientific expertise with stakeholder engagement, positioning you at the forefront of driving business outcomes. You will work closely with Product, Engineering, Design, and Operations teams to guide measurement strategies and tactical decisions, helping to expand the Wolt platform globally.

In this role you will use data to optimize and quantify the onboarding of couriers and help us to reach the right number of couriers in the most efficient way to maximize the business outcome.

From day one you will work on questions such as


What’s the business impact of one missing courier or a delay in the onboarding process?
How do referrals impact courier performance and retention?
What are the main blockers in the onboarding funnel and how can we improve them?
Do automated processes perform better or worse than manual ones and how much so?


You will be the expert from the data side to answer the questions and own exploration, tracking, and experimentation.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs in Berlin, Helsinki and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Germany, Finland and Sweden. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations

A typical candidate for this role has over 3 years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting and a degree in mathematics, statistics, economics, computer science, or a related field.

We value the following attributes in an applicant:


proven track record in using data science to solve business or research problems
expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation, and regression analysis using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent
proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets
good communication skills and the ability to explain complex topics to a technical and non-technical audience
good stakeholder management


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Proficiency in Python, with experience in data science libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
Experience of building low-latency / near real-time processing systems.

We are looking for a (Senior) Data Scientist (Analytics) to join Wolt’s Courier & Logistics mission!

As the international side of the Doordash business, Wolt is active in 27 countries outside of the US and growing. Together with functional and cross-functional partners, you’ll tackle highly impactful challenges to craft the most-loved platform for gig workers, and empower local businesses with our robust logistics system. Ultimately, your efforts will connect consumers to everything they desire.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist at Wolt, you’ll dive deep into our data to tackle crucial business challenges. You will diagnose problem areas, develop new metrics, design experiments, uncover foundational causal relationships in our data, and influence strategic decisions. This role combines scientific expertise with stakeholder engagement, positioning you at the forefront of driving business outcomes. You will work closely with Product, Engineering, Design, and Operations teams to guide measurement strategies and tactical decisions, helping to expand the Wolt platform globally.

In this role you will use data to optimize and quantify the onboarding of couriers and help us to reach the right number of couriers in the most efficient way to maximize the business outcome.

From day one you will work on questions such as


What’s the business impact of one missing courier or a delay in the onboarding process?
How do referrals impact courier performance and retention?
What are the main blockers in the onboarding funnel and how can we improve them?
Do automated processes perform better or worse than manual ones and how much so?


You will be the expert from the data side to answer the questions and own exploration, tracking, and experimentation.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs in Berlin, Helsinki and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Germany, Finland and Sweden. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations

A typical candidate for this role has over 3 years of experience in a data science or analytics position within an industry or research setting and a degree in mathematics, statistics, economics, computer science, or a related field.

We value the following attributes in an applicant:


proven track record in using data science to solve business or research problems
expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, experimentation, and regression analysis using statistical software packages in Python, R, or equivalent
proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries for large data sets
good communication skills and the ability to explain complex topics to a technical and non-technical audience
good stakeholder management


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

Which markets/cities should we enter next?


How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?


What is the business impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?


Can the Delivery food market sustain multiple players?


What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?


What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants?


What impact do online reviews have?


How will a change in the user interface affect customer choice behaviour?





The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.


Requirements:



Masters Degree or PhD in Economics or Econometrics (preferred)


Always curious and willing to learn new skills


A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset


Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business-relevant economic problems


A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail


Proficiency with analytical tools like R/Python and familiarity with SQL


Ideally industry experience since the completion of your academic career


Excellent people skills — you’ll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into economic problems





At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. The scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.




We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & BenefitsAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




DiversityAt Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.




We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know.

LoanTube is a leading London-based FinTech and FCA Authorised Broker (FRN #753151), empowering individuals and businesses in the UK to access the right credit products to lead their best financial lives.




Our platform is seamlessly integrated into the UK lending ecosystem, delivering real-time, personalised credit offers tailored to users’ unique needs. Since pioneering transparent loan comparison in 2019, we now process over 100k credit applications every month from individuals and businesses alike.




Financial empowerment is at the heart of our mission – to make credit accessible and work for everyone, while maximising financial literacy.




In 2025, we’re doubling down on our commitment to drive financial inclusion for millions of consumers and small businesses left behind by legacy credit providers. We are doing this by further expanding our suite of seamless fintech products that deliver true financial innovation to those who need it most.




Our culture and values

We are a diverse, globally distributed team of innovators and engineers (spanning India, Brazil, the USA, and beyond) working in an incredibly fast-paced, agile environment. Relentless optimism, grit, and adaptability define our culture. If you thrive on challenges and want to help redefine lending, we’d love to hear from you.




At LoanTube, we believe it’s always day one. We’re proudly bootstrapped and self-sustaining, and we’re bringing our scrappy, all-hands-on-deck ethos into the next phase of our explosive growth.




Our culture is built for self-starters who love solving real-world problems. Every role is product-focused, self-motivated, and business-minded. If you’re not a fan of meetings, enjoy taking ownership, and dream of running a business someday, LoanTube is the place for you.




What makes us tick:

Extreme Ownership: We set a strategic roadmap as a team and empower individuals to lead. Your project > your process > your responsibility.
Collaborative Alignment: Weekly catch-ups ensure every key area of the business stays connected. No one operates in silos; we run the business together.
No Bureaucracy: Forget 1:1s and performance plans. Need to discuss something? Just wheel across the room :)
Win Together, Lose Together: Everyone here is an entrepreneur at heart. We focus on solutions, not blame, and move forward as a team to build products that truly serve our customers.
Learn by Doing: We love to tinker and figure things out. “I’ve never done this before” is a default Tuesday in the office.




If this sounds like the environment for you, keep reading!




The role

At LoanTube, we process vast amounts of data (1,000+ data points per application). Historically, we’ve adopted an 80/20 approach to leveraging this data across marketing and product. As our dedicated Data Scientist, your mission will be to transform this into a strategic advantage by driving our data efforts to the next level.




Sitting at the heart of the core team, you’ll gain a deep understanding of our business to uncover opportunities where advanced modelling can create the most value. From there, you will own the end-to-end lifecycle of model development – from opportunity sizing to deployment and monitoring – to deliver measurable business impact.




What you’ll do

Collaborate with colleagues across business domains to identify opportunities to generate value.
Build statistical/ML models that deliver tangible business results at scale.
Design and execute experiments/analysis to estimate the impact of potential projects.
Develop and maintain key metrics and reports for your initiatives.
Collaborate with the engineering team to constantly upgrade our data infrastructure.




Who you are

At least a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Math, Stats, Physics, or Computer Science) and 2+ years of relevant work experience.
Experience creating statistical/ML models to solve business problems (customer segmentation, propensity to buy, credit risk etc). 
Proficiency in programming/modeling using Python and advanced querying using SQL.
Experience taking models from proofs of concept into production within highly scaled data infrastructure (BigQuery, Databricks, pipelines etc)
Business mindset. You’re comfortable linking abstract mathematical concepts to tangible business results.
You’re genuinely excited to work with us in the office – five days a week – embracing the energy and collaboration of being together.




Benefits

Competitive salary + generous profit-sharing / equity package.
20 paid holidays + a “duvet day” on your birthday + bank holidays.
£500 annual Learning and Development budget.
1 week work from anywhere policy.
Monthly company team events.
Top-tier office environment complemented by a complimentary on-site gym.
Prime office location in Hammersmith, with easy access to major Tube lines: Piccadilly, Circle, District, H&C.




Selection process

We’ve been on the other side of the table: companies who waste your time, job offers that don’t materialise, and technical tasks that don’t get reviewed.




So here’s our process:

30 min intro call with Dima – Growth Lead
30 min technical screening with Henrique – Product Lead (B2C)
Face-to-Face interview in the office with the Founders and our whole team

OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We believe that achieving our goal requires real world deployment and iteratively updating based on what we learn.

The Intelligence and Investigations team supports this by identifying and investigating misuses of our products – especially new types of abuse. This enables our partner teams to develop data-backed product policies and build scaled safety mitigations. Precisely understanding abuse allows us to safely enable users to build useful things with our products.

About The Role

As a Data Scientist on the Monitoring Operations team, you will be responsible for building systems to proactively identify abuse on OpenAI’s products. This includes ensuring we have robust monitoring in place for new products, and can sustain monitoring for existing products. You will also respond to critical escalations, especially those that are not caught by our existing safety systems. This will require expert understanding of our products and data, and involves working cross-functionally with product, policy, and engineering teams.

This role is based in our London office and includes participation in an on-call rotation that will involve resolving urgent escalations outside of normal work hours. Some investigations may involve sensitive content, including sexual, violent, or otherwise-disturbing material.

In This Role, You Will


Scope and implement monitoring requirements for new product launches. This involves working with Product and Policy teams to understand key risks, and working with Engineering teams to ensure we have sufficient data and tooling.
Improve processes to sustain monitoring operations for existing products. This includes developing approaches to automate monitoring subtasks.
Experience prototyping and launching abuse detection.
Comfort with and experience directly investigating bad actors or behaviours and/or working with investigative experts.


You Might Thrive In This Role If You


Have at least 4 years of experience doing technical analysis, especially in SQL and Python.
Experience using LLMs to automate work.
Experience developing/improving policies and/or human review protocols.
Have experience in trust and safety and/or have worked closely with policy, enforcement, and engineering teams.
Have experience with basic data engineering, such as building core tables or writing data pipelines (not expected to build infrastructure or write production code).
Have experience scaling and automating processes, especially with language models.


Compensation, Benefits And Perks

This is a position with OpenAI UK Ltd., which controls the hiring and management of this position.

Total compensation includes a competitive salary, generous equity, and benefits.


Private medical insurance covering 100% of premiums for employees and their dependents
Pension plan with 4% employer contribution
52 weeks of maternity leave and 24 weeks of parental leave
Unlimited time off
Annual learning & development stipend ($1,500 USD equivalent per year)

The Data team is a cross-functional team of experienced and passionate data enthusiasts. We use and own modern data tools (Fivetran, Snowflake, dbt, Looker) and cover a diverse range of data problems and stakeholders.

What We're Offering You


Flexible hours and summer hours
Competitive holiday benefits (25 days a year paid holiday, plus 8 bank holidays)
Work from anywhere for 2 weeks a year
Life Assurance to protect your loved ones
Benefits allowance for health, dental, and vision coverage
Defined Contribution Pension and Salary Sacrifice Scheme
Be Well: Our award-winning wellbeing and mental health programme to support all MVFers and their families
Family Forward support for our MVF parents and their mini-mes
Free breakfast when in the office


The Role

MVF is seeking an exceptionally skilled and driven Data Scientist to deliver upon our plans for growth. This is a hybrid-role across Data Science and ML Engineering: we would like someone with either a background in machine learning engineering, but a desire to learn and grow in creating data science products or vice versa.

You Will Be Pivotal In Building Our Data Science And Machine Learning Capabilities In Order To Hit Our Strategic Goals. These Are The Problem Spaces In Our Backlog

Imbalanced classification - predicting the value of leads
Optimisation (e.g., Linear programming) - optimising which leads / products we sell to which client
Forecasting - predicting client demand
Experimentation


You will be communicative, commercially-minded, with a strong team-spirit. You will enjoy collaborating with stakeholders, as you will be delivering value across the business, from Paid Marketing to Operations and Sales.

Reporting to the Head of Data, you will collaborate closely with a Senior Data Scientist to deliver upon our roadmap. You will have support from Analytics Engineering teams to build and maintain pipelines and from Software Engineering teams to productionize models. The ideal candidate will relish the opportunity to understand their stakeholders more deeply and define where they think they (and Data Science) can add the most value. With support, they will be excited to build data science models from inception to production.

Responsibilities


Build and manage a Machine Learning Platform by selecting and integrating tools that complement the existing data ecosystem (AWS, Snowflake)
Productionise ML models, ensuring that they are running scalably, efficiently and robustly
Develop Data Science/Machine Learning products addressing key business needs in accordance with ML best practices


What Success Looks Like


Building effective and efficient Data Science models that deliver measurable business value
Ensuring Machine Learning is executed using best-in-class tools, techniques, and approaches within budget and time constraints
Ensuring exceptional data integrity and quality across all projects
Develop ML monitoring and observability pipeline for deployed models


Our Ideal MVF’er


3+ years of experience in a dedicated Data Science/Machine Learning role; additional data or commercial experience is a plus
Strong understanding of mathematical background, focusing on statistics and linear algebra
Highly proficient in Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, PySpark) and SQL
Experience with Snowflake (function & procedure) and Snowpark is a plus
Experience with unit and integration tests
Strong understanding of machine learning algorithms and best practices
Vision for MLOps best practices, particularly regarding version control, Docker, MLFlow, CI/CD
Strong communication skills, with the ability to engage effectively with diverse stakeholders
Good commercial understanding; knowledge of marketing operations is a bonus

LoanTube is a leading London-based FinTech and FCA Authorised Broker (FRN #753151), empowering individuals and businesses in the UK to access the right credit products to lead their best financial lives.




Our platform is seamlessly integrated into the UK lending ecosystem, delivering real-time, personalised credit offers tailored to users’ unique needs. Since pioneering transparent loan comparison in 2019, we now process over 100k credit applications every month from individuals and businesses alike.




Financial empowerment is at the heart of our mission – to make credit accessible and work for everyone, while maximising financial literacy.




In 2025, we’re doubling down on our commitment to drive financial inclusion for millions of consumers and small businesses left behind by legacy credit providers. We are doing this by further expanding our suite of seamless fintech products that deliver true financial innovation to those who need it most.




Our culture and values

We are a diverse, globally distributed team of innovators and engineers (spanning India, Brazil, the USA, and beyond) working in an incredibly fast-paced, agile environment. Relentless optimism, grit, and adaptability define our culture. If you thrive on challenges and want to help redefine lending, we’d love to hear from you.




At LoanTube, we believe it’s always day one. We’re proudly bootstrapped and self-sustaining, and we’re bringing our scrappy, all-hands-on-deck ethos into the next phase of our explosive growth.




Our culture is built for self-starters who love solving real-world problems. Every role is product-focused, self-motivated, and business-minded. If you’re not a fan of meetings, enjoy taking ownership, and dream of running a business someday, LoanTube is the place for you.




What makes us tick:

Extreme Ownership: We set a strategic roadmap as a team and empower individuals to lead. Your project > your process > your responsibility.
Collaborative Alignment: Weekly catch-ups ensure every key area of the business stays connected. No one operates in silos; we run the business together.
No Bureaucracy: Forget 1:1s and performance plans. Need to discuss something? Just wheel across the room :)
Win Together, Lose Together: Everyone here is an entrepreneur at heart. We focus on solutions, not blame, and move forward as a team to build products that truly serve our customers.
Learn by Doing: We love to tinker and figure things out. “I’ve never done this before” is a default Tuesday in the office.




If this sounds like the environment for you, keep reading!




The role

At LoanTube, we process vast amounts of data (1,000+ data points per application). Historically, we’ve adopted an 80/20 approach to leveraging this data across marketing and product. As our dedicated Data Scientist, your mission will be to transform this into a strategic advantage by driving our data efforts to the next level.




Sitting at the heart of the core team, you’ll gain a deep understanding of our business to uncover opportunities where advanced modelling can create the most value. From there, you will own the end-to-end lifecycle of model development – from opportunity sizing to deployment and monitoring – to deliver measurable business impact.




What you’ll do

Collaborate with colleagues across business domains to identify opportunities to generate value.
Build statistical/ML models that deliver tangible business results at scale.
Design and execute experiments/analysis to estimate the impact of potential projects.
Develop and maintain key metrics and reports for your initiatives.
Collaborate with the engineering team to constantly upgrade our data infrastructure.




Who you are

At least a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Math, Stats, Physics, or Computer Science) and 2+ years of relevant work experience.
Experience creating statistical/ML models to solve business problems (customer segmentation, propensity to buy, credit risk etc). 
Proficiency in programming/modeling using Python and advanced querying using SQL.
Experience taking models from proofs of concept into production within highly scaled data infrastructure (BigQuery, Databricks, pipelines etc)
Business mindset. You’re comfortable linking abstract mathematical concepts to tangible business results.
You’re genuinely excited to work with us in the office – five days a week – embracing the energy and collaboration of being together.




Benefits

Competitive salary + generous profit-sharing / equity package.
20 paid holidays + a “duvet day” on your birthday + bank holidays.
£500 annual Learning and Development budget.
1 week work from anywhere policy.
Monthly company team events.
Top-tier office environment complemented by a complimentary on-site gym.
Prime office location in Hammersmith, with easy access to major Tube lines: Piccadilly, Circle, District, H&C.




Selection process

We’ve been on the other side of the table: companies who waste your time, job offers that don’t materialise, and technical tasks that don’t get reviewed.




So here’s our process:

30 min intro call with Dima – Growth Lead
30 min technical screening with Henrique – Product Lead (B2C)
Face-to-Face interview in the office with the Founders and our whole team

We are home to some of the world's leading experts on autonomous vehicles, creating solutions such as Oxa Driver, equipping vehicles with full self-driving functionality; Oxa MetaDriver, using Generative AI to accelerate and assure the safety of deployments; and Oxa Hub, a set of cloud-based offerings for autonomous fleet management. Our technology is being deployed across the UK and the U.S, and we're partnering with a fast-growing ecosystem of operators, vehicle OEMs and equipment makers serving autonomous transportation globally as it advances.

Based in Oxford, and with offices in Canada and the U.S, Oxa was founded in 2014 and is  growing rapidly (350+ ‘Oxbots' to date). Our purpose is to change the way the Earth moves, through an uncompromising focus on safety, efficiency and explainability of our AI approaches. The company has attracted $225 million from leading investors so far, with $140 million raised in the last Series C funding round in January 2023.

Your Team

Oxa Foundry is a suite of tools that combines generative AI, digital twins and simulation to accelerate machine learning and testing of self-driving technology before and during real-world use.Tools within Oxa Foundry are also unlocking new opportunities to launch innovative solutions for industries such as commercial fleet insurance and risk management. Leveraging Oxa's experience of deploying AVs and establishing capabilities to safely scale (by identifying, quantifying and managing route risk with limited or no pre-existing data), we are helping organisations in those markets augment and generate new data to develop transformative fleet risk management solutions for their own customers.

Your team will ensure the company has enough data of the right kind and the right time from the right sources to sustain rapid improvement across all its tools. It will ensure suitable data ownership across our own fleet and via our customers and partners using data synthesis and expansion, simulation, automatic annotation and logging where appropriate.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$140,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

          <strong>About Stripe<br><br></strong>Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.<br><br><strong>About The Team<br><br></strong>Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.<br><br>What you'll do<br><br>We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.<br><br>Who you are<br><br>We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.<br><br><strong>Minimum Requirements<br><br></strong><ul><li>3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience</li><li>Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R </li><li>Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation</li><li>Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results</li><li>Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact</li><li>A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail</li><li>Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations</li><li>A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom<br><br><br></li></ul><strong>Preferred Qualifications<br><br></strong><ul><li>Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance</li><li>Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs</li><li>Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.</li><li>A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)<br><br><br></li></ul>Hybrid work at Stripe<br><br>This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).<br><br>Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.<br><br>A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.<br><br>Pay and benefits<br><br>The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$140,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.<br><br>Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Working with data at this scale is a rare opportunity. This is a chance to apply your skills and grow your expertise in analyzing vast datasets and extracting actionable insights to optimize live campaigns and platform features, ensuring measurable improvements for advertisers.




Professional development. You want to grow - your skills, your influence, your career. We push the limits to improve and to reach our full potential, individually and as a company.

Collaborate. You will work with product managers, engineers, and designers to integrate data science solutions into the platform. You will provide data-driven recommendations to enhance features such as dynamic ad creatives, real-time analytics, and programmatic ad placements. You will communicate the performance and results of the models to management, providing clear and actionable recommendations based on the findings.




What you bring:

Benefits:


Extended health and dental coverage options, along with life insurance and disability benefits
Mental health benefits
Family building benefits
Child care and pet benefits

Traditional approaches require over ten years and two billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical, and their reliance on trial-and-error calls out for better predictive and generative models. The existent datasets are large enough to benefit from sophisticated deep learning architectures, but small enough that ML models can be trained in a few days on a single GPU, facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation. Nevertheless, the current industry standard has progressed little beyond shallow ML techniques such as random forests and support vector machines, largely due to the difficulty of integrating world-class machine learning research with chemistry and pharmacology expertise.




Variational AI is searching for machine learning scientists to join us in our quest to radically accelerate the development of new drugs through machine learning excellence. Over the past five years, we have been advancing the state-of-the-art, and delivering projects to customers such as Merck. You will help us design, implement, test, and refine novel elements of a machine learning architecture built from the ground up to optimize the properties of small molecule drugs; continually improve the robustness of our existing code base; and apply our pipeline to new drug targets. Experience developing novel ML algorithms in domains such as diffusion models, Transformers, graph neural networks, uncertainty quantification, and Bayesian optimization is required, but we can provide all necessary background in chemistry, pharmacology, and biology.




Here is the background we’re looking for:

Ph.D. in CS, applied mathematics, statistics, physics, or related discipline;
Expertise with machine learning techniques, including diffusion models, Transformers, and Bayesian optimization, preferably demonstrated through first-author publications in conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML;
Two or more years’ experience developing robust code on larger projects, including code review, refactoring, unit testing, version control, etc.;
Mastery of Python and PyTorch; and
Intellectual curiosity and drive to excel.




We are an equal opportunity employer and enthusiastically welcome applications from women, BIPOC, and members of underrepresented communities and groups. Compensation is a competitive mix of cash and options. We prioritize expertise and passion over where you decide to live and work. Please send resumes/CVs to info@variational.ai.

Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events


Who you are


You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an experienced Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software
