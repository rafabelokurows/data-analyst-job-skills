We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Deliver proactive insights on key business drivers, financial trends, and potential areas for growth or optimization
Build and refine data science forecasts for both short-term and long-range planning
Empower others through self-service tools and reports that drive awareness and understanding of key metrics
Work with Data Engineering to build core data models that power operational and exploratory data analyses



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have 2+ years of experience in analytics and data science, with a track record of collaborating with finance, business operations, growth, or go-to-market teams
You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)
You have experience building predictive models and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness
You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments

Navier AI is building engineering software for physics-driven design. We are starting by making Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations that are 1000x faster than current solutions. We're leveraging cutting-edge physics machine learning to accelerate traditionally compute-intensive simulations. Why? Because Engineers deserve better tools to drive innovation, from designing efficient aircraft, to faster F1 cars to silent hair dryers. We're not just improving the status quo - we're redefining it.

The Role: ML Researcher

As an ML Engineer on our founding team, you'll work directly on developing and experimenting with novel ML models for physics simulations. We want someone who can go deep on model architectures, learning rate schedules, or loss functions one day, and then jump to building new data pipelines the next.

What We’re Looking For


Strong familiarity with PyTorch
Experience with transformer architectures
Expertise in deep learning for scientific computing
Proficiency in Python and scientific computing libraries
Experience in model designing


Bonus


Familiarity with neural operators, PINNs, and INRs
Background in physics or computational engineering
Experience with large-scale model training and optimization
Published research in ML for physics/engineering


Why This Role Is Special


High Impact : As part of a small, agile team, every line of code you write and every experiment you run will shape the future of the company. You won’t just contribute—you’ll help define the product and the business itself.
Unlimited Learning : This role offers more than technical growth. You’ll have the opportunity to learn about running and scaling a startup, product development, fundraising, and much more.
Deep Collaboration : You’ll work side-by-side with the founders, who bring their aerospace experience from SpaceX, and collaborate with a team of sharp, passionate individuals dedicated to pushing boundaries.


The Founders

Cameron and Evan are former SpaceX-ers who’ve built and launched land, sea, air and space vehicles. As aerospace engineers, they experienced firsthand the challenges of slow, inefficient engineering workflows and founded Navier AI to solve these exact problems.

Location & Compensation


In-person, San Francisco
Salary: $100K-$250K, with an equity package that reflects your founding team member status.


Apply Now!

This is a rare opportunity to join a startup on the ground floor and have a massive impact. If you’re passionate about pushing the boundaries of machine learning and want to see your work directly impact the future of engineering, we want to talk to you!

At Guide Labs, we are building AI systems that are engineered, from the start, to be modular, easily audited, steered, and understood by humans. Conventional model development approaches optimize for narrow performance measures, and jettison key interpretability (and reliability) concerns until after the model has been pre-trained. This approach is fundamentally broken. Guide Labs reimagines the entire model development process: the training dataset, model’s architecture, loss function, pre-training and post-training algorithm, all the way to user interaction with the model.

Team

We are interpretability researchers and engineers that have been responsible for major advances in the field. We have set out to rethink the way machine learning models, AI agents, and systems broadly are developed.

A Note About Experience

We do not care about formal credentials. If you share our vision, have evidence that demonstrates that you can be effective in this role, and would like to get involved, please reach out. If some of the below doesn’t line up perfectly with your profile or past experience, we still encourage you to apply!

About The Role

We are building generative models, across modalities, that are engineered to be interpretable, modular, and easy to audit. As a research scientist, you will be responsible for conducting research, developing AI systems that are modular, easy to understand, steer, and audit. We are looking for people who prioritize impact over traditional academic publications. We expect to publish as we see fit; however, we seek researchers that are excited about translating interpretability research into useful products and insights for end-users and customers. You’ll work to reimagine the entire model building stack from training, fine-tuning, all the way to deployment.

Responsibilities


Design and implement machine learning algorithms to enhance interpretability, modularity, and steerability.
Reimagine interpretability needs for generative models, and perform experiments to demonstrate the reliability of algorithms that claim to support such needs.
Work to scale interpretable models to billions of parameters.
Design experiments, datasets, and algorithms that can effectively help answer research questions relating to interpretability needs.
Run large-scale experiments to test the reliability of a training pipeline.
Build infrastructure for performing experiments, and visualizing the results.
Interpreting and communicating results.


Our Stack


We are not dogmatic. We believe in the right tool for the job. However, most of our stack is currently: Pytorch (Lightning, Hydra, Wandb), Jax, XLA/MLIR, Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure) and HPC/Kubernetes systems.


You are


Enthusiastic about translating algorithmic insights into practice and see research and engineering as two sides of the same coin.
Able to translate research questions into testable experiments, design and run those experiments, and interpret the results.
Interested and enthusiastic about engineering and moving research ideas into product.
Very comfortable in Python, and can pick up other languages, as needed.
Interested in contributing to ideas, figures, and writing of research papers, blog posts, and other technical documents.
Passionate about engineering best practices.
Interested in working as part of a collaborative team instead of solo efforts.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

We are looking for an ML Engineer to join our small but nimble AI team whose mission is to make Notion an ML-powered product. As an ML Engineer, you will work on incorporating large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and other AI technologies into Notion’s product in a high quality way. You’ll be exploring the boundaries of what’s possible with ML technology and finding innovative ways to apply new industry learnings to Notion’s offering.

What You'll Achieve


Work with the team to prototype and experiment with AI model quality improvements, either by fine tuning, prompt engineering, or building new models when needed
Productionize and launch new AI technology integrations into Notion’s core product
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver product features on time
Stay up-to-date with the latest AI technologies and trends



Skills You'll Need To Bring


Domain Expert, Teacher and Learner: You have experience building AI products using LLMs, embeddings or other ML natural language technologies. 3+ years of experience in one or more of the following areas: machine learning, recommendation or ranking systems, natural language understanding/generation or artificial intelligence. You’re excited about bringing your pre-existing knowledge to the team, but you balance that with perpetual curiosity and understanding that there is always more to learn.
Holistic Problem Solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
Communicate with Care: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
Impact Driven: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals.



Nice To Haves


You understand how parts of a system fit together, from the user interface to the data model. You are familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
You’re proficient with data pipeline technologies: Spark, DBT, etc
You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or literature.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

Since this is an early-stage opportunity, our ideal candidate will be able to not only champion and drive DS efforts within the company but also be able to contribute to production code as well (more details to follow). The founders will be leaning more toward candidates who are ""customer obsessed"" vs those who are ""masters of craft"" in data science.




Qualifications:




MS or PhD with 8+ years industry experience in Product DS/User Behavior Modeling, Quant/Stats, Data Engineering, Analytics, and Software Development (Python)
Scope: looking for proven, hands on leaders with customer-driven mindsets (Staff-level+)




The role:




Since the data is extremely diverse, there is lot of ambiguity to embrace. Our ideal candidate will be able to ask the right questions of the data (and request the right kinds of data from our customers); test hypotheses that can be validated, productionized, and refined; present key findings to external, non-technical users; automate the core workflow and expose new services to internal systems (modeling work will mostly rely on open source technology).




About Us:




Greylock is an early-stage investor in hundreds of remarkable companies including Airbnb, LinkedIn, Dropbox, Workday, Cloudera, Facebook, Instagram, Roblox, Coinbase, Palo Alto Networks, among others. More can be found about us here: https://greylock.com/




We are full-time, salaried employees of Greylock who provide free candidate referrals/introductions to our active investments to help them grow/succeed (as one of the many services we provide).




How We Work:




We will contact anyone who looks like a potential match--requesting to schedule a call with you immediately.




Due to the selective nature of this service and the volume of applicants we typically receive from our job postings, a follow-up email will not be sent until a match is identified with one of our investments.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion is seeking a Finance Data Scientist to join our growing team. In this role, you'll work at the intersection of Finance, Product, and Go-to-Market, using data to drive Notion's growth and success.

Your work will translate initiatives from both our self-serve and sales-assisted businesses into tangible revenue outcomes. You'll partner with the Strategic Finance team to identify growth opportunities, develop insights that deepen our understanding of the business, and forecast future performance.

What You'll Achieve


Partner with Strategic Finance to understand the drivers of our business and accelerate Notion's growth
Deliver proactive insights on key business drivers, financial trends, and potential areas for growth or optimization
Build and refine data science forecasts for both short-term and long-range planning
Empower others through self-service tools and reports that drive awareness and understanding of key metrics
Work with Data Engineering to build core data models that power operational and exploratory data analyses



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have 2+ years of experience in analytics and data science, with a track record of collaborating with finance, business operations, growth, or go-to-market teams
You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)
You have experience building predictive models and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness
You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

We’re working with a tier-one hedge fund as they continue to scale their Data Science capabilities. Despite what was a challenging year for many in the markets this firm came out with double-digit gains and is continuing to scale for 2024. That was possible by hiring the best talent on the market combining that with first in class technology and resources. Compensation is some of the strongest on the street.




Role Summary




You will focus on utilizing quantitative methods to analyze various alternative and economic data sets (transaction, web traffic, clinical trial, now-cast, survey, shipping, satellite, geolocation etc.) to generate signals for investing. You will work closely with the Portfolio Manager on how your analysis could impact their universe and ultimately PnL.




It’s a given this role has technical elements but equally as important is the ability to communicate your analysis and really look to monetize that. As they look to monetize the data, creativity surrounding the data and analysis is very much encouraged. They need someone who enjoys the technical elements but also wants to combine them with the fundamentals of working close to the markets.




As a senior hire you will lead the most impactful projects, you will also play a part in mentoring some of the junior team members.




Who you are:




Our client is looking for an individual who has a demonstrable interest in the markets as well as strong communication and presentation skills. See the requirements below:




STEM academic background

Fast-growing measurement company looking for a Data Scientist with 3-5 years of experience to work with our Data Science team to help build the AU and drive our measurement product forward.

Who We Are

Adelaide is the leader in one of the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising: attention metrics.

Since 2020, we’ve been a trusted measurement partner for 40% of Fortune 50 companies. They rely on our metric, AU, to maximize the effectiveness of media spend. AU is “the attention economy's most widely recognized metric,” according to Adweek, and we swept the measurement category in the 2024 Adexchanger awards.

Our business is growing rapidly—we’ve doubled revenue in just 18 months and grew our team by 45% last year. Earlier this year, in partnership with The New York Times, we launched Adelaide for Publishers, the next step in our vision to create a more fair and equitable marketplace for media.

Adelaide is backed by prominent investors such as Human Ventures (Joe Marchese), Aperiam Ventures (Joe Zawadzki & Eric Franchi), WGI (Jonah Goodhart), and Irwin Gotlieb.

While we have an office in NYC, we’re very remote-friendly and support flexible work arrangements.

How We Operate

We are a team of action-oriented doers; management rolls up their sleeves to contribute daily. Our culture is rooted in curiosity and loosely held but rigorously vetted opinions; everyone is encouraged to contribute to planning and strategy.

Position Overview

This position reports to the Director of Data Science; it will help to continue pushing forward the underlying models and data sets that create the AU, and work closely with product and client services team members to develop new data products and methodologies in support of all areas of the business.

In this role, you will be joining a team of other data scientists and data engineers, and work with people across the organization to shape Adelaide’s data into a clear and concise story. You’ll be responsible for working with hundreds of millions of data points a day, quickly iterating on optimization methods that further advertising effectiveness and fuel the world’s first attention-based optimization platform. Day-to-day activities range from identifying and exploring new data sources, to training new models and iterating on existing models, to improving our codebase and pipelines.

This is a fully remote position within the United States, with opportunities to connect with colleagues at our New York office.

What You'll Learn

An important part of our culture is continuing education and the sharing of ideas. We offer:


A large network of investors and advisors for you to access that will help your team succeed
Mentorship from executives with decades of experience in adtech and media
Regular internal knowledge-sharing sessions
Education budget to accelerate your team’s development


Specifically, In This Role, You Will Learn


Gain a deep understanding of attention metrics and media quality measurement
Complex user interaction patterns and ML solutions to account for specialized data sets
Methods for processing and deriving insights from massive amounts of user experience signals
Best practices and collaborative product development in a fast-paced collaborative environment


Core Responsibilities


Interpret raw data and form compelling narratives to draw meaningful insights that communicate our story and mission
Work with our Data Science team, as well as Product and Customer Success, to shape Adelaide’s data into a clear and concise story
Help to formulate, develop, and optimize models in production
Help to support and augment our machine learning system to aid advertisers in buying efficient media
Support client management teams with data-driven insights based on millions of behavioral data points each day

Fast-growing measurement company looking for a Data Scientist with 3-5 years of experience to work with our Data Science team to help build the AU and drive our measurement product forward.

Who We Are

Adelaide is the leader in one of the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising: attention metrics.

Since 2020, we’ve been a trusted measurement partner for 40% of Fortune 50 companies. They rely on our metric, AU, to maximize the effectiveness of media spend. AU is “the attention economy's most widely recognized metric,” according to Adweek, and we swept the measurement category in the 2024 Adexchanger awards.

Our business is growing rapidly—we’ve doubled revenue in just 18 months and grew our team by 45% last year. Earlier this year, in partnership with The New York Times, we launched Adelaide for Publishers, the next step in our vision to create a more fair and equitable marketplace for media.

Adelaide is backed by prominent investors such as Human Ventures (Joe Marchese), Aperiam Ventures (Joe Zawadzki & Eric Franchi), WGI (Jonah Goodhart), and Irwin Gotlieb.

While we have an office in NYC, we’re very remote-friendly and support flexible work arrangements.

How We Operate

We are a team of action-oriented doers; management rolls up their sleeves to contribute daily. Our culture is rooted in curiosity and loosely held but rigorously vetted opinions; everyone is encouraged to contribute to planning and strategy.

Position Overview

This position reports to the Director of Data Science; it will help to continue pushing forward the underlying models and data sets that create the AU, and work closely with product and client services team members to develop new data products and methodologies in support of all areas of the business.

In this role, you will be joining a team of other data scientists and data engineers, and work with people across the organization to shape Adelaide’s data into a clear and concise story. You’ll be responsible for working with hundreds of millions of data points a day, quickly iterating on optimization methods that further advertising effectiveness and fuel the world’s first attention-based optimization platform. Day-to-day activities range from identifying and exploring new data sources, to training new models and iterating on existing models, to improving our codebase and pipelines.

This is a fully remote position within the United States, with opportunities to connect with colleagues at our New York office.

What You'll Learn

An important part of our culture is continuing education and the sharing of ideas. We offer:


A large network of investors and advisors for you to access that will help your team succeed
Mentorship from executives with decades of experience in adtech and media
Regular internal knowledge-sharing sessions
Education budget to accelerate your team’s development


Specifically, In This Role, You Will Learn


Gain a deep understanding of attention metrics and media quality measurement
Complex user interaction patterns and ML solutions to account for specialized data sets
Methods for processing and deriving insights from massive amounts of user experience signals
Best practices and collaborative product development in a fast-paced collaborative environment


Core Responsibilities


Interpret raw data and form compelling narratives to draw meaningful insights that communicate our story and mission
Work with our Data Science team, as well as Product and Customer Success, to shape Adelaide’s data into a clear and concise story
Help to formulate, develop, and optimize models in production
Help to support and augment our machine learning system to aid advertisers in buying efficient media
Support client management teams with data-driven insights based on millions of behavioral data points each day
Work with the engineering team to build efficient and robust data pipelines
Help direct experimental studies aimed at understanding advertising value across multiple channels and media environments

Grubhub is looking for an innately curious, business-minded, results-oriented Data Scientist to work in our Discovery and Ads teams. We are focused on providing high quality and highly relevant merchant recommendations and ads to users who are exploring restaurants, looking to order groceries, something from the neighborhood pharmacy, as well as those who are searching for something specific across these verticals. As a member of this highly collaborative team you will partner with other data scientists, engineering, and product to deliver new run time models and services not only in Ads, but improve recommendations and search across the Top of the Diner funnel as a whole. You will also be responsible for creating metrics to validate performance of models, proposing new algorithmic approaches to improve our current system, designing A/B tests, and identifying creative solutions to bridge state of the art information retrieval advanced and business and engineering requirements. Additionally you will be driving technology best practices and guiding the evolution of responsive systems. Responsibilities also include but are not limited to creating documentation accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences, mentoring junior data scientists, creating and maintaining automated training jobs, creating metrics dashboards and alerts, advising best algorithmic trade offs to business stakeholders.




Our team practices end to end project ownership and our work focuses heavily on personalized recommendation and classification from content and clickstream. Deep neural networks, transfer learning from pretrained large scale models, classic regressions, fine tuning, and large language models all have a place in our daily lexicon.
