Are you proud of your technical skills, commercial head and ability to get shit done? You're reading the right job description. We want someone who is inspired to work in tech for good and is jumping out of bed in the morning because the idea of using their skills to improve the lives of millions of potential customers all over the world, gets them going.

Before we talk about our product and mission, let's be clear that although we're tackling men's sexual problems right now, you don't need to be a guy to apply. We want to hear from candidates of all genders. We believe that if we solve these problems, everyone will benefit.

At Mojo, building the first sexually intelligent generation.

Sexual problems can be embarrassing, we've been there. That's why we're changing the narrative around issues in the bedroom.

We believe that good sex starts in your head, so we're not here to push pills or offer quick fixes to the 50% of Millennials and Gen Z who now suffer with psychological issues in the bedroom. Nope, our app is created by the world's best sexual wellbeing specialists to help our members lead thriving and healthy sex lives 💪. We are looking for someone that is excited to be part of that.

We've had crazy global growth, with over 500,000 members in 150 countries and counting. We're backed by two of Europe's top VC firms, and you might even have seen us on the front cover of the Sunday Times.

The Role

You'll work closely with the founders, report to our Chief of Staff and take ownership of much of our data stack.

Most importantly you will be in a position to identify how Mojo can have the biggest impact for our members. We are an app-first experience, meaning this impact will touch people all over the world.

As we are an early-stage start-up, there is room for you to have a huge impact on the future of the company and a large amount of autonomy to shape your role and get stuck in. You should be comfortable adapting your role and responsibilities as the company grows. We expect this might consist of:

Supporting the refinement of our data infrastructure, architecture, and ETL processes
Collaboratively setting standards and ways of working with Data at Mojo
Building a self-serve data culture across the wider Mojo team through upskilling and accessible data tooling


We are building a team of people that have real ownership over the business. To be successful here, you should be willing to roll your sleeves up and get your hands dirty on anything that will help the business be more successful.

Requirements

You have:


2+ years of proven experience analyzing complex data with SQL, Python (& maybe R)
A degree or similar experience in a quantitative field (eg CompSci, Eng, Maths, Stats, Econ)
A good understanding of the dynamics of acquisition, engagement, retention and monetisation in a digital product
Strong understanding of statistical concepts and practical experience applying them (e.g. causal inference, ML, A/B tests)
Experience building data visualizations and dashboards (e.g., looker studio or others)
Ability to work collaboratively and proactively in a fast-paced environment
A commercial head and can put numbers into business perspective
Great communication skills - in person, writing, and code; to technical or non-technical audiences
Compassion, empathy, understanding, or interest in mental health
Ability to keep up-to-date with the latest tools and trends

Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




DiversityAt Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.




We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process.

LoanTube is a leading London-based FinTech and FCA Authorised Broker (FRN #753151), empowering individuals and businesses in the UK to access the right credit products to lead their best financial lives.




Our platform is seamlessly integrated into the UK lending ecosystem, delivering real-time, personalised credit offers tailored to users’ unique needs. Since pioneering transparent loan comparison in 2019, we now process over 100k credit applications every month from individuals and businesses alike.




Financial empowerment is at the heart of our mission – to make credit accessible and work for everyone, while maximising financial literacy.




In 2025, we’re doubling down on our commitment to drive financial inclusion for millions of consumers and small businesses left behind by legacy credit providers. We are doing this by further expanding our suite of seamless fintech products that deliver true financial innovation to those who need it most.




Our culture and values

We are a diverse, globally distributed team of innovators and engineers (spanning India, Brazil, the USA, and beyond) working in an incredibly fast-paced, agile environment. Relentless optimism, grit, and adaptability define our culture. If you thrive on challenges and want to help redefine lending, we’d love to hear from you.




At LoanTube, we believe it’s always day one. We’re proudly bootstrapped and self-sustaining, and we’re bringing our scrappy, all-hands-on-deck ethos into the next phase of our explosive growth.




Our culture is built for self-starters who love solving real-world problems. Every role is product-focused, self-motivated, and business-minded. If you’re not a fan of meetings, enjoy taking ownership, and dream of running a business someday, LoanTube is the place for you.




What makes us tick:

Extreme Ownership: We set a strategic roadmap as a team and empower individuals to lead. Your project > your process > your responsibility.
Collaborative Alignment: Weekly catch-ups ensure every key area of the business stays connected. No one operates in silos; we run the business together.
No Bureaucracy: Forget 1:1s and performance plans. Need to discuss something? Just wheel across the room :)
Win Together, Lose Together: Everyone here is an entrepreneur at heart. We focus on solutions, not blame, and move forward as a team to build products that truly serve our customers.
Learn by Doing: We love to tinker and figure things out. “I’ve never done this before” is a default Tuesday in the office.




If this sounds like the environment for you, keep reading!




The role

At LoanTube, we process vast amounts of data (1,000+ data points per application). Historically, we’ve adopted an 80/20 approach to leveraging this data across marketing and product. As our dedicated Data Scientist, your mission will be to transform this into a strategic advantage by driving our data efforts to the next level.




Sitting at the heart of the core team, you’ll gain a deep understanding of our business to uncover opportunities where advanced modelling can create the most value. From there, you will own the end-to-end lifecycle of model development – from opportunity sizing to deployment and monitoring – to deliver measurable business impact.




What you’ll do

Collaborate with colleagues across business domains to identify opportunities to generate value.
Build statistical/ML models that deliver tangible business results at scale.
Design and execute experiments/analysis to estimate the impact of potential projects.
Develop and maintain key metrics and reports for your initiatives.
Collaborate with the engineering team to constantly upgrade our data infrastructure.




Who you are

At least a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Math, Stats, Physics, or Computer Science) and 2+ years of relevant work experience.
Experience creating statistical/ML models to solve business problems (customer segmentation, propensity to buy, credit risk etc). 
Proficiency in programming/modeling using Python and advanced querying using SQL.
Experience taking models from proofs of concept into production within highly scaled data infrastructure (BigQuery, Databricks, pipelines etc)
Business mindset. You’re comfortable linking abstract mathematical concepts to tangible business results.
You’re genuinely excited to work with us in the office – five days a week – embracing the energy and collaboration of being together.




Benefits

Competitive salary + generous profit-sharing / equity package.
20 paid holidays + a “duvet day” on your birthday + bank holidays.
£500 annual Learning and Development budget.
1 week work from anywhere policy.
Monthly company team events.
Top-tier office environment complemented by a complimentary on-site gym.
Prime office location in Hammersmith, with easy access to major Tube lines: Piccadilly, Circle, District, H&C.




Selection process

We’ve been on the other side of the table: companies who waste your time, job offers that don’t materialise, and technical tasks that don’t get reviewed.




So here’s our process:

30 min intro call with Dima – Growth Lead
30 min technical screening with Henrique – Product Lead (B2C)
Face-to-Face interview in the office with the Founders and our whole team
