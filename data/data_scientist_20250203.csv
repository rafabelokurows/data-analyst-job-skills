Twitch is the world’s biggest live streaming service, with global communities built around gaming, entertainment, music, sports, cooking, and more. It is where thousands of communities come together for whatever, every day.

We’re about community, inside and out. You’ll find coworkers who are eager to team up, collaborate, and smash (or elegantly solve) problems together. We’re on a quest to empower live communities, so if this sounds good to you, see what we’re up to on LinkedIn and Twitter, and discover the projects we’re solving on our Blog. Be sure to explore our Interviewing Guide to learn how to ace our interview process.

About The Team

The Community Discovery Machine Learning (CDML) team powers the systems that help millions of active viewers find the creators and communities they'll enjoy most. Powering the home page recommendations, browse, search, and feed ranking experiences, this team and its algorithms are at the heart of enabling the connections that make Twitch a great place for so many users.

About The Role

Data is critical to the algorithms that power the recommendation, search, and ranking systems. It's also critical to making decisions, especially working on systems that are themselves data-driven. As a Senior Data Scientist on the CDML team, you'll be responsible for helping drive improvements to the machine learning systems as well as analytics to drive decision-making.

While there is a team of Applied Scientists building and shipping the algorithms themselves, data science can help improve these systems directly. In this role, you can identify and build new signals to input into the models. We're also working on the value model that the algorithm optimizes, and your input will be critical to understanding the tradeoffs and balancing multiple objectives in a scientific way.

We also still have big unanswered analytics questions to solve. How often do viewers just want to get to the content they already know they want to watch, and when are they open to exploring new channels? These are the sorts of questions you'll be tackling.

You can work in San Francisco, CA; New York, NY; or Seattle, WA.

You Will:



Inform product strategies by defining and updating core metrics for each initiative
Estimate the opportunity sizing of new features the team could take on
Identify and build new signals to incorporate into the algorithms driving recommendations, search, and feed ranking at Twitch
Identify metric tradeoff ratios that help inform value model choices, long-term impact from early-growth-funnel users, and other product decisions
Establish analytical framework for your team: ad-hoc analysis, automated dashboards, and self-service reporting tools to surface key data to stakeholders
Design A/B experiments to drive product direction with iterative innovation and measurement
Work hand-in-hand with business, product, engineering, and design to proactively influence and inform teammates' decisions throughout the product life cycle
Distill ambiguous product or business questions, find clever ways to answer them, and to quantify the uncertainty



You Have:



BA/BS in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or equivalent industry experience
5+ years of experience as a data scientist or data analyst in a high velocity, data-driven environment
5+ years of machine learning/statistical modeling data analysis tools and techniques, and parameters that affect their performance experience
Expert SQL skills and proficiency in Python/R
Experience using data to create insight, drive business decisions and influence leadership



Bonus Points



MS/MA or higher in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related technical field
Experience working on algorithms powering large-scale consumer services
Experience in a data science team working on customer software products, analytics, and insights
Experience working with software development and operational event data
Familiarity with Twitch, either as a viewer or creator (or both!)



Perks



Medical, Dental, Vision & Disability Insurance
401(k)
Maternity & Parental Leave
Flexible PTO
Amazon Employee Discount

Twitch is the world’s biggest live streaming service, with global communities built around gaming, entertainment, music, sports, cooking, and more. It is where thousands of communities come together for whatever, every day.

We’re about community, inside and out. You’ll find coworkers who are eager to team up, collaborate, and smash (or elegantly solve) problems together. We’re on a quest to empower live communities, so if this sounds good to you, see what we’re up to on LinkedIn and Twitter, and discover the projects we’re solving on our Blog. Be sure to explore our Interviewing Guide to learn how to ace our interview process.

About The Team

The Community Discovery Machine Learning (CDML) team powers the systems that help millions of active viewers find the creators and communities they'll enjoy most. Powering the home page recommendations, browse, search, and feed ranking experiences, this team and its algorithms are at the heart of enabling the connections that make Twitch a great place for so many users.

About The Role

Data is critical to the algorithms that power the recommendation, search, and ranking systems. It's also critical to making decisions, especially working on systems that are themselves data-driven. As a Senior Data Scientist on the CDML team, you'll be responsible for helping drive improvements to the machine learning systems as well as analytics to drive decision-making.

While there is a team of Applied Scientists building and shipping the algorithms themselves, data science can help improve these systems directly. In this role, you can identify and build new signals to input into the models. We're also working on the value model that the algorithm optimizes, and your input will be critical to understanding the tradeoffs and balancing multiple objectives in a scientific way.

We also still have big unanswered analytics questions to solve. How often do viewers just want to get to the content they already know they want to watch, and when are they open to exploring new channels? These are the sorts of questions you'll be tackling.

You can work in San Francisco, CA; New York, NY; or Seattle, WA.

You Will:



Inform product strategies by defining and updating core metrics for each initiative
Estimate the opportunity sizing of new features the team could take on
Identify and build new signals to incorporate into the algorithms driving recommendations, search, and feed ranking at Twitch
Identify metric tradeoff ratios that help inform value model choices, long-term impact from early-growth-funnel users, and other product decisions
Establish analytical framework for your team: ad-hoc analysis, automated dashboards, and self-service reporting tools to surface key data to stakeholders
Design A/B experiments to drive product direction with iterative innovation and measurement
Work hand-in-hand with business, product, engineering, and design to proactively influence and inform teammates' decisions throughout the product life cycle
Distill ambiguous product or business questions, find clever ways to answer them, and to quantify the uncertainty

          <strong>About Us<br><br></strong>Twitch is the world’s biggest live streaming service, with global communities built around gaming, entertainment, music, sports, cooking, and more. It is where thousands of communities come together for whatever, every day.<br><br>We’re about community, inside and out. You’ll find coworkers who are eager to team up, collaborate, and smash (or elegantly solve) problems together. We’re on a quest to empower live communities, so if this sounds good to you, see what we’re up to on LinkedIn and Twitter, and discover the projects we’re solving on our Blog. Be sure to explore our Interviewing Guide to learn how to ace our interview process.<br><br><strong>About The Team<br><br></strong>The Community Discovery Machine Learning (CDML) team powers the systems that help millions of active viewers find the creators and communities they'll enjoy most. Powering the home page recommendations, browse, search, and feed ranking experiences, this team and its algorithms are at the heart of enabling the connections that make Twitch a great place for so many users.<br><br><strong>About The Role<br><br></strong>Data is critical to the algorithms that power the recommendation, search, and ranking systems. It's also critical to making decisions, especially working on systems that are themselves data-driven. As a Senior Data Scientist on the CDML team, you'll be responsible for helping drive improvements to the machine learning systems as well as analytics to drive decision-making.<br><br>While there is a team of Applied Scientists building and shipping the algorithms themselves, data science can help improve these systems directly. In this role, you can identify and build new signals to input into the models. We're also working on the value model that the algorithm optimizes, and your input will be critical to understanding the tradeoffs and balancing multiple objectives in a scientific way.<br><br>We also still have big unanswered analytics questions to solve. How often do viewers just want to get to the content they already know they want to watch, and when are they open to exploring new channels? These are the sorts of questions you'll be tackling.<br><br>You can work in San Francisco, CA; New York, NY; or Seattle, WA.<br><br><strong>You Will:<br><br><br></strong><ul><li>Inform product strategies by defining and updating core metrics for each initiative</li><li>Estimate the opportunity sizing of new features the team could take on</li><li>Identify and build new signals to incorporate into the algorithms driving recommendations, search, and feed ranking at Twitch</li><li>Identify metric tradeoff ratios that help inform value model choices, long-term impact from early-growth-funnel users, and other product decisions</li><li>Establish analytical framework for your team: ad-hoc analysis, automated dashboards, and self-service reporting tools to surface key data to stakeholders </li><li>Design A/B experiments to drive product direction with iterative innovation and measurement</li><li>Work hand-in-hand with business, product, engineering, and design to proactively influence and inform teammates' decisions throughout the product life cycle</li><li>Distill ambiguous product or business questions, find clever ways to answer them, and to quantify the uncertainty<br><br><br></li></ul><strong>You Have:<br><br><br></strong><ul><li>BA/BS in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or equivalent industry experience</li><li>5+ years of experience as a data scientist or data analyst in a high velocity, data-driven environment</li><li>5+ years of machine learning/statistical modeling data analysis tools and techniques, and parameters that affect their performance experience</li><li>Expert SQL skills and proficiency in Python/R</li><li>Experience using data to create insight, drive business decisions and influence leadership<br><br><br></li></ul><strong>Bonus Points<br><br><br></strong><ul><li>MS/MA or higher in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related technical field</li><li>Experience working on algorithms powering large-scale consumer services</li><li>Experience in a data science team working on customer software products, analytics, and insights</li><li>Experience working with software development and operational event data</li><li>Familiarity with Twitch, either as a viewer or creator (or both!)<br><br><br></li></ul><strong>Perks<br><br><br></strong><ul><li>Medical, Dental, Vision &amp; Disability Insurance</li><li>401(k)</li><li>Maternity &amp; Parental Leave</li><li>Flexible PTO</li><li>Amazon Employee Discount<br><br><br></li></ul><em>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at Twitch.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion is seeking a Finance Data Scientist to join our growing team. In this role, you'll work at the intersection of Finance, Product, and Go-to-Market, using data to drive Notion's growth and success. The ideal candidate is a strong communicator with a growth mindset who collaborates effectively and focuses on action and impact.

Your work will translate initiatives from both our self-serve and sales-assisted businesses into tangible revenue outcomes. You'll partner with the Strategic Finance team to identify growth opportunities, develop insights that deepen our understanding of the business, and forecast future performance.

What You'll Achieve


Partner with Strategic Finance to understand the drivers of our business and accelerate Notion's growth
Deliver proactive insights on key business drivers, financial trends, and potential areas for growth or optimization
Build and refine data science forecasts for both short-term and long-range planning
Empower others through self-service tools and reports that drive awareness and understanding of key metrics
Work with Data Engineering to build core data models that power operational and exploratory data analyses



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have 2+ years of experience in analytics and data science, with a track record of collaborating with finance, business operations, growth, or go-to-market teams
You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R)
You have experience building predictive models and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness
You're comfortable transforming raw data to build your own datasets if the metric you need doesn't exist yet
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy
Strong communication and collaboration while working in cross-functional environments



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $136,000 - $180,000 per year.

Navier AI is building engineering software for physics-driven design. We are starting by making Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations that are 1000x faster than current solutions. We're leveraging cutting-edge physics machine learning to accelerate traditionally compute-intensive simulations. Why? Because Engineers deserve better tools to drive innovation, from designing efficient aircraft, to faster F1 cars to silent hair dryers. We're not just improving the status quo - we're redefining it.

The Role: ML Researcher

As an ML Engineer on our founding team, you'll work directly on developing and experimenting with novel ML models for physics simulations. We want someone who can go deep on model architectures, learning rate schedules, or loss functions one day, and then jump to building new data pipelines the next.

What We’re Looking For


Strong familiarity with PyTorch
Experience with transformer architectures
Expertise in deep learning for scientific computing
Proficiency in Python and scientific computing libraries
Experience in model designing


Bonus


Familiarity with neural operators, PINNs, and INRs
Background in physics or computational engineering
Experience with large-scale model training and optimization
Published research in ML for physics/engineering


Why This Role Is Special


High Impact : As part of a small, agile team, every line of code you write and every experiment you run will shape the future of the company. You won’t just contribute—you’ll help define the product and the business itself.
Unlimited Learning : This role offers more than technical growth. You’ll have the opportunity to learn about running and scaling a startup, product development, fundraising, and much more.
Deep Collaboration : You’ll work side-by-side with the founders, who bring their aerospace experience from SpaceX, and collaborate with a team of sharp, passionate individuals dedicated to pushing boundaries.


The Founders

Cameron and Evan are former SpaceX-ers who’ve built and launched land, sea, air and space vehicles. As aerospace engineers, they experienced firsthand the challenges of slow, inefficient engineering workflows and founded Navier AI to solve these exact problems.

Location & Compensation


In-person, San Francisco
Salary: $100K-$250K, with an equity package that reflects your founding team member status.


Apply Now!

This is a rare opportunity to join a startup on the ground floor and have a massive impact. If you’re passionate about pushing the boundaries of machine learning and want to see your work directly impact the future of engineering, we want to talk to you!

Join us and be part of something extraordinary.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion is seeking a Finance Data Scientist to join our growing team. In this role, you'll work at the intersection of Finance, Product, and Go-to-Market, using data to drive Notion's growth and success. The ideal candidate is a strong communicator with a growth mindset who collaborates effectively and focuses on action and impact.

Your work will translate initiatives from both our self-serve and sales-assisted businesses into tangible revenue outcomes. You'll partner with the Strategic Finance team to identify growth opportunities, develop insights that deepen our understanding of the business, and forecast future performance.

What You'll Achieve


Partner with Strategic Finance to understand the drivers of our business and accelerate Notion's growth
Deliver proactive insights on key business drivers, financial trends, and potential areas for growth or optimization
Build and refine data science forecasts for both short-term and long-range planning
Empower others through self-service tools and reports that drive awareness and understanding of key metrics

Nooks is a platform transforming sales reps from manual laborers to scientists. With today’s technology, sales reps shouldn’t need to manually write hundreds of emails, research hundreds of websites/linkedins, and make hundreds of calls. They should instead focus on the parts of their job that actually require people - talking to customers, being creative, and problem-solving. With a combination of AI tools, automation and real-time collaboration, Nooks can do the rest.

The problem

Sales pipeline is critical for growing companies. Many, especially B2B companies, have teams of sales/business development representatives (SDR/BDRs) or full-cycle account executives whose responsibility is to identify, contact, and qualify new potential customers. There are ~750,000 SDR/BDR’s in the US alone (e.g. Airtable, Brex, Databricks and many other tech companies have sizable SDR/BDR teams)

In their day-to-day, SDR/BDRs spend time on 3 main activities:


Prospecting & research - identify a list of potential customers using signals like industry, size, fundraising, headcount growth, new hires, job descriptions, etc.
Email & LinkedIn messaging - write messages to those contacts to convey the problem and pitch your product. The goal is for them to book a demo
Calling - Live phone conversations often have higher conversion than emails because they’re more personal, but there’s a lot more manual work involved


Most of the sales rep’s job can be automated with today’s technology: large language models, web scraping, automation, integrations, etc.

The role

Note: Exact job title will be commensurate with experience

We have an ambitious product vision in a nascent area - AI-powered realtime collaboration - so there are a ton of interesting technical challenges on our roadmap. This is a role focused on implementing ML features into Nooks. Our ideal candidate will have prior experience working in industry for a business where ML is a core part of the offering.

Responsibilities will include training production models to improve their accuracy for specific sales use cases. You will align our technical strategy with performance, cost and feasibility considerations.

Examples of engineering problems you may touch

These are just examples, this list is non-exhaustive, and you definitely don’t need experience in all of these areas. But hopefully you find some of them exciting!


Realtime audio AI & precision/recall/latency tradeoffs (algorithms & models)
We use audio data, transcription, silence detection, and several other signals to detect whether a live phone call is a voicemail, a human, or a dial tree. Here, latency is a third factor added to the standard precision/recall tradeoff because it’s important we can detect humans quickly. Our approach involves LLM embeddings, few-shot learning, data labeling, and continuous monitoring of model performance in prod.
Smart call funnels & playbooks (data wrangling, backend eng, GPT-3, UX)
At what point in the conversation do my reps get stuck? What are the toughest questions that we need to address? Can I “program” a playbook so that Nooks will help my team standardize toward best-practices? We’re using GPT-3 and other LLM’s to turn companies’ mostly unstructured call data into actionable strategies & feedback loops.
Conversation embeddings & markov models (ML modeling)
What does the anatomy of a call look like? If I say XYZ, what are the different ways the prospect might answer and the probabilities of each? Conditioned on the first half of the call, what do I say next to maximize the likelihood that I book a demo at the end of the call? Can we use LLM’s to generate embeddings of conversations that we can use to cluster similar conversation patterns and predict where the conversation is headed?

Requirements


Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, or a related field.
3+ years of industry experience, including 2+ years training and deploying ML models in production.
Full stack ML Eng chops: proficiency in general purposes programming languages such as Python/Javascript, and with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, scikit-learn etc.
Expertise in areas like NLP, Deep Learning, Anomaly Detection, Transformers and Large Language Models.


Nice To Haves


Background in an analytical field like heuristics, data science &/or statistics
Prior experiences working in both startup and research environments


We offer competitive compensation because we want to hire the best people and reward them for their contributions to our mission. We pay all employees competitively relative to market. In compliance with pay transparency laws and in pursuit of pay equity and fairness, we publish salary ranges for our open roles. The target salary range for this role is $140,000 - $240,000. On top of base salary, we also offer equity, generous perks and comprehensive benefits.

Fast-growing measurement company looking for a Data Scientist with 3-5 years of experience to work with our Data Science team to help build the AU and drive our measurement product forward.

Who We Are

Adelaide is the leader in one of the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising: attention metrics.

Since 2020, we’ve been a trusted measurement partner for 40% of Fortune 50 companies. They rely on our metric, AU, to maximize the effectiveness of media spend. AU is “the attention economy's most widely recognized metric,” according to Adweek, and we swept the measurement category in the 2024 Adexchanger awards.

Our business is growing rapidly—we’ve doubled revenue in just 18 months and grew our team by 45% last year. Earlier this year, in partnership with The New York Times, we launched Adelaide for Publishers, the next step in our vision to create a more fair and equitable marketplace for media.

Adelaide is backed by prominent investors such as Human Ventures (Joe Marchese), Aperiam Ventures (Joe Zawadzki & Eric Franchi), WGI (Jonah Goodhart), and Irwin Gotlieb.

While we have an office in NYC, we’re very remote-friendly and support flexible work arrangements.

How We Operate

We are a team of action-oriented doers; management rolls up their sleeves to contribute daily. Our culture is rooted in curiosity and loosely held but rigorously vetted opinions; everyone is encouraged to contribute to planning and strategy.

Position Overview

This position reports to the Director of Data Science; it will help to continue pushing forward the underlying models and data sets that create the AU, and work closely with product and client services team members to develop new data products and methodologies in support of all areas of the business.

In this role, you will be joining a team of other data scientists and data engineers, and work with people across the organization to shape Adelaide’s data into a clear and concise story. You’ll be responsible for working with hundreds of millions of data points a day, quickly iterating on optimization methods that further advertising effectiveness and fuel the world’s first attention-based optimization platform. Day-to-day activities range from identifying and exploring new data sources, to training new models and iterating on existing models, to improving our codebase and pipelines.

This is a fully remote position within the United States, with opportunities to connect with colleagues at our New York office.

What You'll Learn

An important part of our culture is continuing education and the sharing of ideas. We offer:


A large network of investors and advisors for you to access that will help your team succeed
Mentorship from executives with decades of experience in adtech and media
Regular internal knowledge-sharing sessions
Education budget to accelerate your team’s development


Specifically, In This Role, You Will Learn


Gain a deep understanding of attention metrics and media quality measurement
Complex user interaction patterns and ML solutions to account for specialized data sets
Methods for processing and deriving insights from massive amounts of user experience signals
Best practices and collaborative product development in a fast-paced collaborative environment

Through our expertise, mindset, culture and most importantly with your help we are turning the AI landscape upside down. Are you excited to contribute to meaningful, impactful projects?

Our proposition to you


We vouch to create a space where you can explore different sets of complex problems and data across industries and verticals.
To support you in your personal development, everyone at Kineo has a mentor. When you grow, so does Kineo.
Your decisions matter! You will not have a boss who decides things for you. At Kineo we believe that decisions are best made locally, by the people closest to the problem at hand.
Transparent salary and career planning from day one.
A beautiful office in the centre of Kreuzberg, with tons of benefits, such as free drinks, snacks, consoles etc.
28 days of vacation
A shared revenue model - when Kineo does well, you will benefit financially, too



Success in the role means that you will have


After 2 months: You established yourself as a member of the team and have already contributed to one of our client projects. You have a clear understanding of how we work and can independently navigate our technical architecture.
After 6 months: You are a key member of the team and fully involved in the development of a client project. You will have made notable contributions to our codebase and internal processes.
After 12-24 months: In collaboration with internal science and engineering resources, you lead the development of a client-facing application from the workshop phase to production. You are a trusted expert in a wide variety of machine learning algorithms and you are able to transfer that knowledge to more junior members of the team.



Your Character Traits


You want to achieve something and don't need a ""manager"" to tell you that. You are eager to have space to take responsibility and grow from that.
You enjoy exploring beyond your immediate tasks and are open to learning new skills. You collaborate across different areas to help the team succeed, even in areas outside your main expertise.
You are a strong communicator with the ability to present ideas clearly and collaborate effectively. You value building positive relationships and working together to achieve shared goals.



You fit in with our team culture if you


Enjoy working in an environment that combines pragmatic, commercial thinking with a strong desire to learn and grow together. We value team players that are curious but convey humility and respect for different opinions.
You actively choose to work in a start-up, with all the ups and downs.
See open feedback, accountability and independent thinking as the foundation for exceptional (team) work.
You embrace Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. You are excited to contribute to an environment where different perspectives are celebrated, and you actively participate in fostering awareness and continuous learning around DEI.



Tasks


You will work as part of smaller teams of 2-3 people on developing machine learning solutions with our clients.
You will conceptualize and implement algorithmic solutions to challenging business problems. This includes prototyping and productionizing of machine learning solutions, and also defining and analysing product use cases together with the customer.
You will own machine learning solutions from the first drop of raw data, all the way into production serving millions of inference requests.



Requirements


An advanced quantitative degree - e.g Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science or related fields. Strong knowledge of theoretical math and CS.
At least two years of work experience as Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.
Knowledge of working with large structured and unstructured data sets. Knowledge of data engineering tools like Apache Spark is an advantage.
Strong programming skills in Python. We love other languages too, but Python is what we (and you) will use.
We are AI Consultants - ask yourself: Do you want to be a Consultant?
Experience in using a wide range of ML frameworks such as SKLearn, Tensorflow, Torch in production. Experience with domain specific libraries like OpenCV, HuggingFace etc are an advantage.
Good written and verbal communication in both English and German. Most of our clients are German speaking so a level of at least B2 is required for the role.
Resident in Germany. Due to the size of the company, we cannot currently accept applications from other EU/non-EU countries.



We explicitly do not hire anyone who discriminates against people on the basis of religion, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status or other aspects. We encourage people from LGBTQIA+ and other underrepresented groups to apply.

Last but not least, keep in mind that we are hiring value based, not skill based. That being said, please tell us the following in your contact message:

DIRECTION DE LA RECHERCHE ET DE L’INNOVATION

CDI - TEMPS PLEIN

DES QUE POSSIBLE

L’entrepôt de données de santé du CHU de Poitiers recrute un Data Scientist H/F souhaitant travailler sur un projet ambitieux visant à exploiter de grands volumes de données pour générer de nouvelles connaissances médicales.

Présentation générale du CHU et de son entrepôt de données

Composé d’environ 2 700 lits, le CHU de Poitiers s’étend sur 5 sites (Poitiers, Châtellerault, Loudun, Lusignan, Montmorillon) répartis sur l’ensemble du territoire de la Vienne. Établissement de soins de référence, il assure ses missions de soins et de recherche pour les 1,8 millions d’habitants du Poitou-Charentes. Le CHU de Poitiers est organisé en 15 pôles d’activités cliniques et médico-techniques.

Le CHU de Poitiers est lauréat de l’appel à projets « Accompagnement et soutien à la constitution d’Entrepôts de Données de Santé hospitaliers » soutenu par France 2030. Le plan « France 2030 », doté de 54 milliards d’euros déployés sur 5 ans, vise à développer la compétitivité industrielle et les technologies d’avenir à l’horizon 2030. Cet entrepôt de données permettra aux chercheurs un accès aux données dans un cadre technique et sécurisé.

De nombreuses informations médicales sont mentionnées en texte libre et sont présentes dans les comptes-rendus, courriers et notes médicales. L’intégration de ces informations nécessite le déploiement d’un pipeline de traitement automatique de la langue (TAL) complet : extraction du contenu textuel des documents dans différents formats (doc, docx, pdf), pseudonymisation, reconnaissances d’entités nommées, annotation sémantique, chargement dans l’entrepôt de données et indexation. De plus, les projets de recherche nécessitent souvent des développements spécifiques visant à extraire des informations précises ou à classifier automatiquement des documents médicaux.

Certains développements seront réalisés en collaboration avec les équipes des CHU de Bordeaux et de Limoges dans une vision d’infrastructure régionalisée en Nouvelle-Aquitaine.

In the AI Era, modern technology should be at the backbone of supply chains, but the world is not quite there yet. From retail stores all the way up to large-scale enterprise, professionals are craving tech solutions to run supply chain operations in much better ways, saving money and reducing the environmental footprint on our planet.

That’s why we are building Cargoful, an AI-based SaaS company that wants to elevate supply chains to the level they should be at.

We are a small team of young and international professionals who want to change how supply chains are run, from the ground up. We come from top companies and research centres (MIT, McKinsey, NASA, London Business School, Leonardo, Politecnico di Milano, Sant’Anna), we are backed by leading institutions from the Silicon Valley (Berkeley SkyDeck) and Italy (s2capital, B4i) and driven by a strong will to make things happen.

We are looking for individuals to join us in building the supply chain tech of the future.

🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🇮🇹 🇨🇭




Responsibilities

Our new team member will work directly with our Chief Analytics Officer, and in collaboration with the rest of the engineering team, to design, create and deploy Optimization and Machine Learning algorithms.




Examples of activities you will perform: 

Create geo-spatial forecasting models to predict demand for last-mile deliveries
Optimize large scale combinatorial problems using Operations Research algorithms (metaheuristics, genetic algorithms or exact methods)
Build datapipeline to extract insights from vast amounts of GPS datapoints
Develop custom clustering algorithms to speed up optimization model
Collaborate closely with the Software Engineering team to deploy all model in production within a real Web Application




What we offer:

A driver’s seat in a small, selected and very ambitious team. At Cargoful, every single individual matters and is crucial in transforming our vision into reality. WhatsApp only had 50 employees when sold to Facebook for $16 billion in 2014. What can we achieve in the era of one-person-billion-dollar companies? Let’s find out together.
Direct exposure to complex problems with no easy solutions. Building groundbreaking technology isn't smooth - we confront an endless stream of technical and managerial challenges that will test you rigorously and drive you to learn and improve. We all aspire to be the best professionals we can be, and to achieve this, we push ourselves hard.
Ownership, responsibility, impact. Cargoful is already powering the supply chains of large multinational corporations - there's significant room for accountability and little margin for error. Each of us takes ownership, cares for the rest of the team, and stands up when needed




What we don't offer

Regularity & smooth sailing. Every day is completely different from the previous one. The span of activities is extremely wide but we expect you to become a “little” expert in a variety of different fields. Your team-mates and clients will rely on you – that means you’ll need to be there when they need you.
The safe heaven of standards and procedures. We are building a brand new company and pre-cooked processes do not exists for us. We expect you to contribute to design how the company processes should look like in 2-5 years from now rather than adapting to rules.




Qualifications

Experience: 1-2 years
Education: Engineering, Math, Data science, Statistics or Physics degree
Language: At least B2 level (Intermediate) in English
Set-up: hybrid, 3 days/week in presence in our Milan office (Porta Romana)

Vacatureomschrijving

Grote datasets bevatten waardevolle inzichten. Als data scientist zul je deze inzichten ontsluiten met behulp van je vaardigheid in programmeertalen zoals Python en R, evenals visualisatietools zoals Tableau en Power BI. Je zult deze inzichten communiceren naar stakeholders, zodat we die data kunnen omzetten in actie. Van jou wordt verwacht dat je de meest efficiënte oplossing analyseert en identificeert, terwijl je aandacht besteedt aan de details. Onze data scientists zijn bedreven in Hadoop & Spark, en cloudplatformen zoals AWS en Azure. Deze tools, gecombineerd met jouw data-expertise, zouden het bouwen van voorspellende modellen, het uitvoeren van hypothesetests en het doen van verkennende data-analyse tot een tweede natuur moeten maken.

DIRECTION DE LA RECHERCHE ET DE L’INNOVATION

CDI - TEMPS PLEIN

DES QUE POSSIBLE

L’entrepôt de données de santé du CHU de Poitiers recrute un Data Scientist H/F souhaitant travailler sur un projet ambitieux visant à exploiter de grands volumes de données pour générer de nouvelles connaissances médicales.

Présentation générale du CHU et de son entrepôt de données

Composé d’environ 2 700 lits, le CHU de Poitiers s’étend sur 5 sites (Poitiers, Châtellerault, Loudun, Lusignan, Montmorillon) répartis sur l’ensemble du territoire de la Vienne. Établissement de soins de référence, il assure ses missions de soins et de recherche pour les 1,8 millions d’habitants du Poitou-Charentes. Le CHU de Poitiers est organisé en 15 pôles d’activités cliniques et médico-techniques.

Le CHU de Poitiers est lauréat de l’appel à projets « Accompagnement et soutien à la constitution d’Entrepôts de Données de Santé hospitaliers » soutenu par France 2030. Le plan « France 2030 », doté de 54 milliards d’euros déployés sur 5 ans, vise à développer la compétitivité industrielle et les technologies d’avenir à l’horizon 2030. Cet entrepôt de données permettra aux chercheurs un accès aux données dans un cadre technique et sécurisé.

De nombreuses informations médicales sont mentionnées en texte libre et sont présentes dans les comptes-rendus, courriers et notes médicales. L’intégration de ces informations nécessite le déploiement d’un pipeline de traitement automatique de la langue (TAL) complet : extraction du contenu textuel des documents dans différents formats (doc, docx, pdf), pseudonymisation, reconnaissances d’entités nommées, annotation sémantique, chargement dans l’entrepôt de données et indexation. De plus, les projets de recherche nécessitent souvent des développements spécifiques visant à extraire des informations précises ou à classifier automatiquement des documents médicaux.

Certains développements seront réalisés en collaboration avec les équipes des CHU de Bordeaux et de Limoges dans une vision d’infrastructure régionalisée en Nouvelle-Aquitaine.

Description du poste

Sous La Responsabilité Du Coordinateur De L’entrepôt Et D’un Médecin Spécialiste Des Entrepôts De Données De Santé, Les Principales Missions Seront De

Participer à l’implémentation d’un pipeline d’intégration des données textuelles.

Réaliser un benchmarking des outils open source disponibles, adapter et tester des modèles existants et les évaluer.

Analyser les besoins et réaliser des développements spécifiques pour les cas d’usage de l’EDS.

Interroger les données de l’EDS pour répondre à des études de faisabilité.

Activités Complémentaires

Participer à la réalisation d’analyses statistiques sur des données structurées pour répondre à des questions de recherche d’études monocentriques

About CloudZero

Cloud cost management is one of the biggest challenges organizations face today. As cloud adoption accelerates, so do the complexities and associated costs - and macroeconomic conditions only increase pressure to prove cloud efficiency. That's why we built CloudZero: a SaaS platform at the intersection of next-generation cloud cost management and FinOps. CloudZero ingests billing and usage data from all cloud, SaaS, and PaaS providers, organizes it in real-time according to our customers' business structures, lets customers view it at any level of time or resource granularity, and ultimately empowers them to make more informed business decisions.

Since our founding in 2016, our mission has been to make efficient innovation a reality for every cloud-driven organization. At CloudZero, we believe every engineering decision is a buying decision, yet the cost conversation often bypasses the engineers who drive those determinations. To solve this, we've built a dynamic, single-page application that answers the complex, data-heavy questions every cloud-based organization needs to ask if they want to grow their company profitably.

To date, we've raised over from leading venture capital firms nationwide. We're solving problems of massive scale, business importance, and complexity in a space that needs it more than ever. We're growing rapidly and would love for you to be a part of it.

Applicants must be authorized to work for any employer in the United States. We cannot currently sponsor or take over the sponsorship of an Employment Visa.

As an AI software company who deploys its inventions directly into the facilities that need them, on state-of-the-art hardware, every line of code written at Tutor has a direct impact on the global, physical economy. We’re seeking the thinkers, builders, and researchers who can help us responsibly deliver the future of automation.

The Role:

In this role you will close the loop between human instruction and robot automation. Models you create will be deployed to robots out in the field, in a tight feedback loop controlled by you. You will create and improve deep learning models such as CNNs, build a cloud-based data and model training platform, and find ways to help our robots optimize for speed and accuracy.

For this role, we seek a pragmatic and competent engineer with domain expertise in computer vision and robotics, and a drive to proliferate robotic technologies.

At Tutor, engineering is inherently cross-disciplinary and collaborative. We seek someone with a diverse background across the robotics stack, including anything from full stack web-dev to mechanical engineering.

Our Culture:

We believe that something truly special can happen when talented, motivated people work together; at Tutor, every member of our team is empowered to have real impact in everything that they do. We work collaboratively on just about everything we do - nobody has the full story, but we are all trying to, and need to work together to maximize our robots performance.

Responsibilities:


Train, fine tune, and deploy visual and language foundation models across our stack
Manage data in databases and optimize the flow of information from our robots to maximize machine learning potential



Skills Needed


Knowledge of machine learning models, particularly visual models with an emphasis on recent advanced models such as SAM, DINO, etc
Strong software skills
Full stack knowledge, ability to not only work on machine learning models in python but also to spin up inference infrastructure, web ui, and perform database operations
General robotics knowledge & experience

For entry level Job seekers to get client interviews and jobs they need to differentiate themselves by ensuring they have exceptional skills and technologies to be noticed by clients.

Since 2010 we have helped Jobseekers differentiate themselves by providing the clients with candidates who have the requisite skills and experience to outperform at interviews and clients. Here at SynergisticIT We just don't focus on getting you a Job we make careers.

All Positions are open for all visas and US citizens

We are matchmakers we provide clients with candidates who can perform from day 1 of starting work. In this economy no client wants or has the resources to take an entry level person and spend resources on upgrading their skills and on top of that pay the jobseeker. That's the specific reason there are so many techies both experience and freshers who are unemployed.

Clients have now the option to hire remote workers from anywhere so for a Jobseeker its important to introspect and see how they can become better and have the skills and technologies to meet client requirements.

We at Synergisticit understand the problem of the mismatch between employer's requirements and Employee skills and that's why since 2010 we have helped thousands of candidates get jobs at technology clients like apple, google, Paypal, western union, Client, visa, walmart labs etc to name a few.
