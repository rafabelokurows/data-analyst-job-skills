Are you proud of your technical skills, commercial head and ability to get shit done? You're reading the right job description. We want someone who is inspired to work in tech for good and is jumping out of bed in the morning because the idea of using their skills to improve the lives of millions of potential customers all over the world, gets them going.

Before we talk about our product and mission, let's be clear that although we're tackling men's sexual problems right now, you don't need to be a guy to apply. We want to hear from candidates of all genders. We believe that if we solve these problems, everyone will benefit.

At Mojo, building the first sexually intelligent generation.

Sexual problems can be embarrassing, we've been there. That's why we're changing the narrative around issues in the bedroom.

We believe that good sex starts in your head, so we're not here to push pills or offer quick fixes to the 50% of Millennials and Gen Z who now suffer with psychological issues in the bedroom. Nope, hyper-personalised AI Therapists are created by the world's best sexual wellbeing specialists to help our members lead thriving and healthy relationships 💪. We are looking for someone who is excited to be part of that.

We've had crazy global growth, with over 600,000 members in 150 countries and counting. We're backed by Europe's top VC firms, and you might even have seen us on the front cover of the Sunday Times.

The Role

You'll work closely with the founders, report to our Chief of Staff and take ownership of much of our data stack. You will be given free reign to spearhead new strategic data projects while helping to set data standards in the company. You'll have the opportunity to guide and enable the whole Mojo team across Product, Growth, Marketing and Ops to make good data driven decisions. Most importantly you will be in a position to identify how Mojo can have the biggest impact for our members. We are an app-first experience, meaning this impact will touch people all over the world.

As we are an early-stage start-up, there is room for you to have a huge impact on the future of the company and a large amount of autonomy to shape your role and get stuck in. You should be comfortable adapting your role and responsibilities as the company grows. We expect this might consist of:


Providing analyses to support product, marketing or finance
Owning tracking of business metrics by refining and maintaining reporting
Developing our best practices for experimentation methodology (eg A/B testing)
Developing data-driven projects, including applications of ML or modelling techniques
Working with leaders across Mojo to identify new opportunities in our AI product
Performing analyses to answer open-ended questions and provide strategic advice
Improving business data documentation
Supporting the refinement of our data infrastructure, architecture, and ETL processes
Collaboratively setting standards and ways of working with Data at Mojo
Building a self-serve data culture across the wider Mojo team through upskilling and accessible data tooling


We are building a team of people that have real ownership over the business. To be successful here, you should be willing to roll your sleeves up and get your hands dirty on anything that will help the business be more successful.

Requirements

You have:


2+ years of proven experience analyzing complex data with SQL, Python (& maybe R)
A degree or similar experience in a quantitative field (eg CompSci, Eng, Maths, Stats, Econ)
A good understanding of the dynamics of acquisition, engagement, retention and monetisation in a digital product
Strong understanding of statistical concepts and practical experience applying them (e.g. causal inference, ML, A/B tests)
Experience building data visualizations and dashboards (e.g., looker studio or others)
Ability to work collaboratively and proactively in a fast-paced environment
A commercial head and can put numbers into business perspective
Great communication skills - in person, writing, and code; to technical or non-technical audiences
Compassion, empathy, understanding, or interest in mental health
Ability to keep up-to-date with the latest tools and trends



Benefits


Industry-leading salary £60-70k, with chunky seed round equity package
Private health, optical, audiological, and dental insurance with Vitality Health
Hybrid working, 3 days in and 2 days out, with great offices in Old Street
Three remote working fortnights a year (read more in our handbook)

Parental leave for primary and secondary caregivers
Workplace nursery benefit and emergency child-sitting allowance

At Deliveroo, we have a world-class data and science organisation with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making.




We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. For example, how can we connect restaurants, riders and customers most efficiently in order to deliver food as quickly as possible? How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind?




These are just some of the tough problems we are solving at Deliveroo. There is no challenge that cannot be yours; the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers at Deliveroo belong to an expert, thoughtful, and active community with guest lecturers, a robust technical review process, a career progression framework, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things.




 




The Role 




As an Operational Research Scientist, you will play a crucial role in developing, implementing, and maintaining cutting-edge products that leverage optimization techniques. Your responsibilities will involve engineering sophisticated operational research algorithms, as well as refining and updating existing systems. 




In this team, you will develop the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo’s delivery network. You will work in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. The team has independence and works on some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants. We evaluate the performance of all our decision-making machines through our world-class experimentation platform.




You will report into a ML/OR Manager. This is a hybrid role that will be based in London.




 




You will:





Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real-time delays.


Enhance our simulation capabilities to more accurately predict the effects of algorithmic changes on our delivery network.


Optimise consumer and rider fees.





Also, you will work alongside people who work on:





The consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes.


Detecting fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants.


Assisting restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish.


Creating an ML platform to improve our ML and optimisation capabilities.





 




Requirements:





You are someone who knows the fundamentals of operational research and when they should be applied through a relevant PhD or work experience.


Proven experience in developing and applying optimization models, algorithms, and metaheuristic techniques in a logistics or supply chain context.


You can translate fuzzy logistics and delivery problems or objectives into a well-thought-out algorithmic solution. You get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.


Strong programming skills in one of the languages such as Python, Rust, C, C++, or Java, with a focus on algorithm design rather than software engineering.


Experience in combinatorial optimisation problems.


A bias to simplicity, where you care most about achieving impact.





Nice to haves: 





Experience in solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) and/or building large scale delivery network simulations


Experience in discrete event simulations


Experience in any of the following areas: algorithms and data structures, parallel and distributed computing, high-performance computing 





Why Deliveroo




Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.




We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & Benefits




At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




Diversity




At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.




We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed.

How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?


What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?


How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?


What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?


How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?





The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)


Experience conducting A/B experiments


Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences


A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset


Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems


A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail


A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.

Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!

Job Summary

At CHIME, chime-experiment.ca, we develop software that supports groundbreaking scientific research in astrophysics. As a Software Developer on our team, you will collaborate with scientists and engineers to create software solutions for CHIME’s research objectives. This role involves tackling complex challenges and contributing to a significant scientific project.

CHIME is a radio telescope that maps the 21-cm signature of neutral hydrogen in the largest volume of space ever surveyed, scans the cosmos for Fast Radio Bursts and monitors all of the Milky Way Pulsars visible in the Northern Hemisphere. CHIME scans the entire northern sky every day and processes over 6.4Tb/s of sky data 24/7 on a large on-site GPU cluster. We are currently engaged in a major upgrade of CHIME’s GPU-based computing infrastructure.

The successful applicant will work with both remote and on-site members of the CHIME team to drive the GPU upgrade and migration efforts across various subsystems within CHIME’s data acquisition system.

Key responsibilities include:


Developing high throughput streaming systems for real-time processing, primarily in C++.
Migration of cluster configuration and management software
Management systems, e.g. tracking and moving data around (custom Python); keep tracking of the telescope configuration (Python+MySQL backend, PHP frontend); monitoring the telescope status (Prometheus and Grafana).


Where exactly the developer spends their time will be determined by their strengths, interests and where the most pressing needs are for the project, but a successful candidate will touch all of the above at some point.

Tasks will include consulting with scientists and engineers to develop use cases for data processing and storage, also working with a team of software engineers and scientists to design, develop, install, deploy, test and maintain the software, and providing support to understand and operate the system.

This position is planned to last for a period of one to two years.

CHIME (chime-experiment.ca) is an exciting, cutting-edge high-profile experiment in Cosmology, Gravity and High-Energy Astrophysics. We are looking for a skilled developer who is enthusiastic about science to strengthen our software team. We are looking for an exceptionally motivated candidate who loves to see the impact of their work.

ORGANIZATIONAL STATUS

Reports to the UBC Investigators of the CHIME Project (Faculty, Professor) and to the CHIME Project Manager. Also interacts with scientific staff and programmers on the CHIME project at UBC, McGill University, University of Toronto and the Dominion Radio Astronomical Observatory and elsewhere.

The work environment is a Physics lab, a friendly and informal environment, with flexible working hours. The team consists of skilled developers (staff and postdoctoral scientists with a heavy software leaning), and physics graduate students, whom the new developer would help mentor.

WORK PERFORMED


Work on migration of subsystems in the real-time data acquisition pipeline once the older generation hardware being replaced with newer hardware with expanded processing and abilities.
Work on automation of application deployment and configuration management (e.g ansible)
Maintain and enhance existing data-quality monitoring framework for the overall operation of the telescope
Design and develop testing and documentation procedures.
Participate in weekly meetings to provide updates on project.
Design, develop, install and maintain systems for remote control and monitoring of the HPC system and its associated infrastructure using web and mobile-based platforms.


CONSEQUENCE OF ERROR

Good technical judgement by the candidate will result in a well-maintained easy-to-use instrument tuned to its scientific purpose. Good design decisions will result in well-written code, with clear software implementation of algorithms, which is easy to test, enhance and maintain

Poor judgement can result in damage, lost observing time and sensitivity, delays and reduced productivity for the entire collaboration.

Job Summary

NetApp's Vancouver Technology Center is pioneering the development of StorageGRID object storage, cloud compatible software handling the exponential growth in big data. This is your chance to work alongside a group of talented developers, impart your vision, and rapidly launch the latest cloud storage software. If you have mastered your current technology, language, or development environments, we know you will fit in with our team.

So, picture yourself working with the world’s best employees. Join the StorageGRID team at NetApp and become a part of one of the top 30 Best Multinational Workplaces in the world as ranked by the Great Place to Work Institute.

You will be part of a team that develops, modifies, and executes automated software test plans; analyzes and writes test standards and procedures; maintains documentation of results; and works closely with development engineers in feature development and resolution of problems.

Your incredible ability to analyze problems and apply to proper test tools and methods will create opportunities to contribute clean code. Naturally, you are as comfortable using new tools and solving new problems as you are improving productivity by refactoring and improving existing tools and workflows.

We are true believers of Agile development and have been on the journey for many years. Continuous integration, TDD, and pair programming occur everywhere. Since you maintain supreme levels of communications with your peers, we won’t inundate you with process and documentation.
