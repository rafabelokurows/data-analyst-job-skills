Our platform provides advertisers with a tool to manage all media investments across various AdTech and media platforms within a single solution and with a multichannel perspective.

MINT's platforms allow advertisers to orchestrate all display, social, search, video, mobile and OOH campaigns from a single interface. Thanks to MINT's artificial intelligence and process automation, companies can orchestrate the entire campaign management process from briefs, planning, and activation to trafficking and reporting. To further enhance effectiveness, advertisers can analyse the massive amount of data generated through the multichannel ecosystem, the ""Big Data"" of advertising, to inform real-time optimizations, creating highly impactful media investments that result in maximum efficiency.

The Role

As a Data Scientist Intern you will be working actively with the broader data science team and the product team.

Your focus will be on a new *Agentic AI* application we're currently building, based on several LLMs (Gemini, OpenAI, ...). Your goal will be to team up with us on a project to enrich/improve/simplify our products, or create new ones. We expect you to create a working PoC, able to prove the added value for Mint.

You will participate in the process of product shaping, researching, building, developing and testing products, all based on our 1st party data, or open data.

Our plan for the future is to automate all the advertising chain, from the buying to the supply and the data enrichment side. Our ambition is to be the best on the market, the most trusted and the top performers. Our investment in AI will grow together with our results, creating an AI lab in the future focussed on advertising.

We use agile methodologies to work within the team and across teams, as we are distributed in 10+ countries in 3 different continents. We employ a hybrid approach with our office in Milan, but most of the work is asynchronous and remote.

What you will learn:


OpenAI (and/or similar tools)
How to create and maintain end-to-end ML models, deployed in a cloud environment
How product and tech blend together when designing AI
Interpreting data to create products that help identify trends or patterns in data
Identifying opportunities to apply new technologies to improve existing processes or procedures
Providing recommendations based on research findings and data analysis
Recommending improvements to existing predictive models or creating new models from scratch



This role will be a great fit if:


You have a degree in Engineering/Math/Stats/Computer Science (or similar), with solid foundations in software development.
You speak mainly Python (and its data processing and data science libraries)
You’re a proactive person, with good problem solving skills and team working attitude.
You believe that automation trumps all, data-driven products are the best and agile is the right methodology to collaborate.
You have good presentation skills, being able to present technical information to a non technical audience or clients is a key.
You speak English fluently
Extra point: knowledge of LLMs and OpenAI
Additional extra point: experience (even minimal) with cloud tools and process



Why you'll love working at MINT:


We offer a competitive salary to recognize the value you bring as a curious and impactful individual
You will have the chance to immerse yourself in a diverse, inclusive and passionate team environment with a strong international presence
As we expand our reach, you would help us achieve our ambitious goals. In this role, you'll play a vital role in driving the company's growth and strategy.
An environment committed to building a diverse team and value your unique perspective
A personalized learning and development program designed to accelerate your professional growth
Striking a healthy work-life balance is key to success. That's why we offer flexible working arrangements, so you can personalize your schedule and maintain a fulfilling personal life. In-person collaboration is also valuable!
We offer meal vouchers (€8) to streamline your lunch break and boost your productivity
Enjoy a variety of free snacks at the office to keep you energized throughout the day
Balance work and fun with our social events! Build relationships and celebrate achievements at our aperitifs and parties.
We actively support social causes through corporate volunteering initiatives, and we encourage our employees to participate



Interview Process

Candidates can expect the following steps in our interview process:


HR Introductory Call (15 minutes): a brief phone call with HR to provide an overview of the company and the role, as well as to gain insight into your experience and background
HR Video Interview (30 minutes): A more in-depth virtual interview with HR to explore the topics discussed in the phone call and further assess your fit for the role

In the AI Era, modern technology should be at the backbone of supply chains, but the world is not quite there yet. From retail stores all the way up to large-scale enterprise, professionals are craving tech solutions to run supply chain operations in much better ways, saving money and reducing the environmental footprint on our planet.

That’s why we are building Cargoful, an AI-based SaaS company that wants to elevate supply chains to the level they should be at.

We are a small team of young and international professionals who want to change how supply chains are run, from the ground up. We come from top companies and research centres (MIT, McKinsey, NASA, London Business School, Leonardo, Politecnico di Milano, Sant’Anna), we are backed by leading institutions from the Silicon Valley (Berkeley SkyDeck) and Italy (s2capital, B4i) and driven by a strong will to make things happen.

We are looking for individuals to join us in building the supply chain tech of the future.

🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🇮🇹 🇨🇭




Responsibilities

Our new team member will work directly with our Chief Analytics Officer, and in collaboration with the rest of the engineering team, to design, create and deploy Optimization and Machine Learning algorithms.




Examples of activities you will perform: 

Create geo-spatial forecasting models to predict demand for last-mile deliveries
Optimize large scale combinatorial problems using Operations Research algorithms (metaheuristics, genetic algorithms or exact methods)
Build datapipeline to extract insights from vast amounts of GPS datapoints
Develop custom clustering algorithms to speed up optimization model
Collaborate closely with the Software Engineering team to deploy all model in production within a real Web Application




What we offer:

A driver’s seat in a small, selected and very ambitious team. At Cargoful, every single individual matters and is crucial in transforming our vision into reality. WhatsApp only had 50 employees when sold to Facebook for $16 billion in 2014. What can we achieve in the era of one-person-billion-dollar companies? Let’s find out together.
Direct exposure to complex problems with no easy solutions. Building groundbreaking technology isn't smooth - we confront an endless stream of technical and managerial challenges that will test you rigorously and drive you to learn and improve. We all aspire to be the best professionals we can be, and to achieve this, we push ourselves hard.
Ownership, responsibility, impact. Cargoful is already powering the supply chains of large multinational corporations - there's significant room for accountability and little margin for error. Each of us takes ownership, cares for the rest of the team, and stands up when needed




What we don't offer

Regularity & smooth sailing. Every day is completely different from the previous one. The span of activities is extremely wide but we expect you to become a “little” expert in a variety of different fields. Your team-mates and clients will rely on you – that means you’ll need to be there when they need you.
The safe heaven of standards and procedures. We are building a brand new company and pre-cooked processes do not exists for us. We expect you to contribute to design how the company processes should look like in 2-5 years from now rather than adapting to rules.




Qualifications

Experience: 1-2 years
Education: Engineering, Math, Data science, Statistics or Physics degree
Language: At least B2 level (Intermediate) in English
Set-up: hybrid, 3 days/week in presence in our Milan office (Porta Romana)




Application instructions

To apply send an email to cosmo@cargoful.tech with a short intro of yourself. Attach your resume/CV and make sure it follows these rules: it's one-page only (no Europass), it includes relevant work experence (sorted by date descending), it includes university grades. Applications sent solely via LinkedIn won't be considered.

WHAT WE OFFER:




COMPENSATION, WELFARE & BENEFIT




Our history, as well as our future, is based on the value of our people. Prometeia’s biggest investment is in our people and it concerns every aspect of professional life. We call it “Total Compensation” and it is made of three elements: Compensation, consisting of a fixed and a variable component, a Welfare Plan active since 2015 –we were among the first companies in Italy to introduce it–, and Benefits, including all initiatives for the well-being of our people.




REMOTE WORKING

Flexibility is an intrinsic value of our way of working. In Prometeia, remote working is an organizational method based on trust. It results in benefits in terms of work/life balance, impact on the environment and optimization of company results through autonomy and empowerment of people.




PEOPLE PROGRAM

Our evaluation system is based on the full enhancement of our people and on continuous dialogue as a stimulus for regular, mutual professional and personal growth. Within the projects, several moments are dedicated to transparent discussions between managers and team members. This allows for reciprocal and prompt feedback. The process is fully digitalized and aimed at continuously improving the strategic growth of both the individual and the company.




TRAINING

Prometeia means continuous training. We provide an average of 11 days of training per year to our people, in person and online. We pay specific attention to younger colleagues, the protagonists of dedicated growth programs, and to the continuous sharing and internal transfer of know-how and skills. On-the-job training is also important and is made of immediate and direct confrontation with the market.




WIN/WIN POLICY

If you are one of our employees and you recommend a person who is later hired, you are entitled to a financial bonus! This is an important opportunity to contribute to the growth of Prometeia as a whole, by attracting acknowledged market professionals and new tech talents.




PHYGITAL MANAGEMENT

We have completely digitalized the management of our physical and virtual environments through the dedicated app Pr(Home)teia. Access to the office, remote working, workstations, meeting rooms, carpooling... everything is just a click away.




COMMUNITY

Our Community is highly diverse, as are the skills of the people who are part of it and who share its values, and the individuals and organizations directly or indirectly involved in our activities. Clients, People of the Group, Alumni, Institutions, Academia, non-profit entities we actively cooperate with are stakeholders representing a great value for us in terms of trust and collaboration.




DIVERSITY

We promote and respect equal opportunities and consider differences as a value. Diversity & Inclusion are fundamental values: from the recruitment phase to everyday life, promoted also through dedicated training moments to develop individual sensitivities and uniqueness.




IMPACT

We responsibly take an active role towards the environment, territories and communities we operate in. Our Headquarter in Bologna has obtained the Leed Gold Certification, one of the highest awards recognizing the efficiency of the building in terms of energy and water savings, CO2 emissions reduction, and improvement of the ecological quality of interiors, materials and resources. In the Sustainability Report we outline the results achieved within the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda drafted by the UN in 2016, that we have been supporting since 2020.

WHAT WE OFFER:




COMPENSATION, WELFARE & BENEFIT




Our history, as well as our future, is based on the value of our people. Prometeia’s biggest investment is in our people and it concerns every aspect of professional life. We call it “Total Compensation” and it is made of three elements: Compensation, consisting of a fixed and a variable component, a Welfare Plan active since 2015 –we were among the first companies in Italy to introduce it–, and Benefits, including all initiatives for the well-being of our people.




REMOTE WORKING

Flexibility is an intrinsic value of our way of working. In Prometeia, remote working is an organizational method based on trust. It results in benefits in terms of work/life balance, impact on the environment and optimization of company results through autonomy and empowerment of people.




PEOPLE PROGRAM

Our evaluation system is based on the full enhancement of our people and on continuous dialogue as a stimulus for regular, mutual professional and personal growth. Within the projects, several moments are dedicated to transparent discussions between managers and team members. This allows for reciprocal and prompt feedback. The process is fully digitalized and aimed at continuously improving the strategic growth of both the individual and the company.




TRAINING

Prometeia means continuous training. We provide an average of 11 days of training per year to our people, in person and online. We pay specific attention to younger colleagues, the protagonists of dedicated growth programs, and to the continuous sharing and internal transfer of know-how and skills. On-the-job training is also important and is made of immediate and direct confrontation with the market.




WIN/WIN POLICY

If you are one of our employees and you recommend a person who is later hired, you are entitled to a financial bonus! This is an important opportunity to contribute to the growth of Prometeia as a whole, by attracting acknowledged market professionals and new tech talents.




PHYGITAL MANAGEMENT

We have completely digitalized the management of our physical and virtual environments through the dedicated app Pr(Home)teia. Access to the office, remote working, workstations, meeting rooms, carpooling... everything is just a click away.




COMMUNITY

Our Community is highly diverse, as are the skills of the people who are part of it and who share its values, and the individuals and organizations directly or indirectly involved in our activities. Clients, People of the Group, Alumni, Institutions, Academia, non-profit entities we actively cooperate with are stakeholders representing a great value for us in terms of trust and collaboration.




DIVERSITY

We promote and respect equal opportunities and consider differences as a value. Diversity & Inclusion are fundamental values: from the recruitment phase to everyday life, promoted also through dedicated training moments to develop individual sensitivities and uniqueness.




IMPACT

We responsibly take an active role towards the environment, territories and communities we operate in. Our Headquarter in Bologna has obtained the Leed Gold Certification, one of the highest awards recognizing the efficiency of the building in terms of energy and water savings, CO2 emissions reduction, and improvement of the ecological quality of interiors, materials and resources. In the Sustainability Report we outline the results achieved within the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda drafted by the UN in 2016, that we have been supporting since 2020.

NOVABLE VISION: ENABLE INNOVATION THROUGH STARTUP RELATIONS

Novable is a tech startup active in the corporate innovation space, providing a startup scouting solution made of advanced technology software and dedicated analyst reviews. In particular, Novable develops an advanced AI-based technology to scout and match startups.

Startups have the innovation power - We believe that startup ecosystems (entrepreneurs, startups, scaleups, hubs, accelerators, venture capital funds) are a glimpse of the future, as they crystallize the forefront of technology innovation everywhere in the world. They are the crystal ball to anticipate future industry trends.

Corporations have the industrial power - On the other side, we believe that corporations have the necessary resources to get things done and to put the best ideas at work on a global scale. In that sense, it is critical that they collaborate with startups, not only for themselves, not only for their survival but also for the greater good of humanity on this planet.

Bring the best of those two worlds together - We are technology optimists. We believe that tech innovation can contribute to solving major societal issues and world problems, provided that enough industrial power is injected into the process. We envision a world where innovation and industry powers connect seamlessly and globally, to speed up the world’s transformation.

Novable mission is to enable innovation through startup relations, by connecting the brightest minds from the startup ecosystem with the strong industrial ambitions of the business world. We allow corporations and companies to identify the most suitable, enterprise-ready innovations matching their strategic agenda.

Who We Are

At Seedtag our goal is to lead the change in the advertising industry because we believe that effective advertising should not be at odds with users’ privacy.

By combining Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision our proprietary, Machine Learning-based technology provides a human-like understanding of the content of the web that finds the best context for each ad while providing unparalleled risk-mitigation capabilities that protect advertisers from showing their ads on pages that could be damaging for their brand. All of this, without relying on cookies or any other tracking mechanisms.

Every day, our teams develop new services that reach over 200 million users worldwide with fast response times to ensure that we deliver the best user experience. We’re fully committed to the DevOps culture, where we provide the platform that our Software Developers and Data Scientists use to manage over 100 different microservices, pushing dozens of changes to production every day. All of this is built on top of Kubernetes in Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services.

If you are interested in joining one of the fastest-growing scale-ups in Europe and working on massive scalability challenges, this is the place for you.




Your Challenge

As a member of our data science team, you will take on the task of developing bidding optimizations through NLP applications, such as large language models, scalable embeddings, and network analysis solutions.
You will be responsible for building and improving bidding functionalities which will have a direct impact on our client’s advertising KPIs.
You will explore the applicability of LLMs for production, crafting solutions that can handle real-world, large-scale challenges, particularly in areas like contextualization, personalization, and relevance optimization.
You will work on end-to-end projects, taking solutions from concept to production, and focusing on creating scalable, efficient, and impactful solutions.
Collaborating closely with our cross-functional teams, your work will be aligned with business goals and drive the practical application of your solutions.




Our core values

Outcome over output

Our core tech values reflect our commitment to delivering exceptional results, fostering a culture of continuous learning, and always putting the customer's needs first. We believe that success comes from focusing on the outcomes rather than just the output. Our tech team aims to solve problems that make a meaningful difference, and we measure our success by the impact we have on the customer.

Failure is allowed, learning is a must

We also recognize that failure is an inevitable part of the innovation process. Our team understands that setbacks are opportunities to learn and grow. We believe in testing early and often, and we continuously iterate and improve until we arrive at the best solution.

We are all scouts

Another core value we hold is that we are all scouts. We believe in leaving things better than we found them. This means we take ownership of our work and strive to improve the systems and processes we touch. We encourage our team members to be proactive in identifying areas for improvement, and we value those who take the initiative to implement positive changes. Our goal is to leave a lasting, positive impact on our projects and our team.

We are data-driven

Lastly, our team is data-driven. We believe that making informed decisions based on data is crucial to our success. Our team uses data to guide our decision-making process and to identify opportunities for improvement. We are committed to using data to continuously monitor and optimize our models and processes to ensure that we are delivering the best possible outcome for our customers.




Tech Stack

We have to support 120k requests per second running with ML models in production answering within 10 milliseconds! We have this running in production with Python and GoLang microservices using datalakes, GCS, Redis, Kinesis or Kafka. All this is constantly deployed in GCP using Kubernetes and other kinds of production stacks. The current stack outputs 20 TB of daily data having them ready to use for analytics and more with easy and low latency access.

You facilitate the communication between AI & Analytics teams and IT production with regards to the deployment of ML models, ensuring that models put in production are equipped with the appropriate data pipelines and monitoring.
You work with the Data Scientists to define and develop the target solution with production constraints in mind. This allows to select the correct run infrastructure and serving model (e.g. data ingestion scheme, API synchronicity …) to address the business requirements (real-time responses, processing volumetry …).
You contribute to the automation of the different elements of the ML pipeline in order to integrate and deploy them in the production environment (e.g. building Docker/VM images, prepare unitary, regression and integration tests …).
You support Data Scientists on the usage of the existing industrial solutions available to build and monitor AI services (i.e. the CI/CD tools).
You support IT Production on the parameterization of the target environment.
You ensure that the model runs without errors, is retrained if needed (incl. automatically) and is monitored both from the IT and the business perspective.

Via Bolt kan je jouw energie rechtstreeks kopen van lokale, groene opwekkers. Bijvoorbeeld van de zonnepanelen van Nico of van de waterkrachtcentrale van Stéphane. Zo weet jij exact waar je energie vandaan komt en waar je geld naartoe gaat.




Waarom doet Bolt dat? De energiemarkt is vandaag niet transparant. Traditionele leveranciers verkopen grijze energie als groene, en helpen ons land niet verduurzamen. Dat wil Bolt veranderen. Ga jij met ons tegen de stroom in?




Wij zijn op zoek naar een Frontend Developer om ons team te versterken.




Jouw verantwoordelijkheden:




Als Medior Frontend Developer creëer je aantrekkelijke en gebruiksvriendelijke features in onze tools. Je vertaalt ontwerpen naar kwalitatieve code en zorgt voor naadloze integraties met zowel onze eigen als externe backend-systemen. Daarnaast werk je ook met ons intern design systeem en help je dit continu te optimaliseren, zodat onze gebruikersinterface functioneel, visueel aantrekkelijk en intuïtief is.




Je komt terecht in ons 8 koppige Product & Service team dat bestaat uit analisten, designers en developers. Dit biedt je de perfecte basis om op terug te vallen en samen met ons te groeien.




Concreter:

Je helpt meebouwen aan een gebruiksvriendelijke website, portaal en designsysteem.
Je werkt zelfstandig volledige frontend-projecten uit.
Je verwerkt feedback na tests en zorgt voor een vlotte opvolging na de go-live.
Je werkt met Git en voert code reviews uit, zodat de code leesbaar en clean blijft.
Je denkt mee over de algemene architectuur van de codebases en fungeert als sparringpartner voor je collega-developers.




Wij bieden jou:




Een boeiende job binnen een groeiende scale-up die positieve impact maakt; met een gevarieerd pakket aan projecten.
Een gedreven en enthousiast team met een positieve mindset. Naast een leuke werksfeer, organiseren we regelmatig afterworks en legendarische teambuildings.
Een werkplek met uitzicht over Brussel, afgewisseld met thuiswerk.
Een marktconform loonpakket/vergoeding.




Wat wij verwachten van jou:




Relevante ervaring: Je hebt 3 jaar ervaring in een gelijkaardige rol.
Expertise: Je hebt HTML en CSS volledig onder de knie, idealiter heb je eerder met SASS gewerkt. Je hebt goede kennis van Next.js, React.js & Typescript en ervaring in het bouwen van schaalbare applicaties. Je begrijpt UX-principes en best practices. Je hebt bovendien ervaring met het integreren van backend systemen & het beheren van (globale) state (bv. Redux). Tot slot ben je vertrouwd met accessibility standaarden & responsive design principes.
Oog voor design: Je hebt oog voor esthetiek en hebt ervaring in het vertalen van designs (Figma) naar pixel-perfect, responsive & functional code.
Proactiviteit en energie: Je voelt verantwoordelijkheid om op een kwalitatieve manier je doelen te behalen en denkt hierbij graag mee aan oplossingen.
Vloeiend Nederlands of Frans en Engels: Je kan je perfect uitdrukken in Nederlands of Frans en spreekt vloeiend Engels.




Hoe solliciteren?




Zie jij het helemaal zitten? Solliciteer via de knop 'Apply' of stuur jouw cv naar talent@boltenergie.be




We bellen je op voor een korte, eerste kennismaking. Nadien nodigen we je uit op kantoor zodat je kennis kan maken met het team. Indien de gesprekken wederzijds positief verlopen, kan je zo snel mogelijk ons team vervoegen.




We are powered by people: Bolt streeft ernaar een inclusieve werkgever te zijn. Alle sollicitanten worden in overweging genomen en krijgen gelijke kansen.

DATA SCIENTIST – GENERATIVE AI SPECIALIST

Entra nel nostro mondo.

Trasforma insieme a noi.

Quale sarà la tua sfida?

Bip ha creato all’interno del proprio Competence Centre “xTech” il più nutrito gruppo di Data Scientist in Italia (fonte: statistiche LinkedIn), e dall’Italia coordina anche i propri gruppi di Data Scientist locali presso le proprie sedi estere.
