Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

At Deliveroo, we have a world-class data and science organisation with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making.




We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. For example, how can we connect restaurants, riders and customers most efficiently in order to deliver food as quickly as possible? How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind?




These are just some of the tough problems we are solving at Deliveroo. There is no challenge that cannot be yours; the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers at Deliveroo belong to an expert, thoughtful, and active community with guest lecturers, a robust technical review process, a career progression framework, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things.




 




The Role 




As an Operational Research Scientist, you will play a crucial role in developing, implementing, and maintaining cutting-edge products that leverage optimization techniques. Your responsibilities will involve engineering sophisticated operational research algorithms, as well as refining and updating existing systems. 




In this team, you will develop the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo’s delivery network. You will work in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. The team has independence and works on some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants. We evaluate the performance of all our decision-making machines through our world-class experimentation platform.




You will report into a ML/OR Manager. This is a hybrid role that will be based in London.




 




You will:





Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real-time delays.


Enhance our simulation capabilities to more accurately predict the effects of algorithmic changes on our delivery network.


Optimise consumer and rider fees.





Also, you will work alongside people who work on:





The consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes.


Detecting fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants.


Assisting restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish.


Creating an ML platform to improve our ML and optimisation capabilities.





 




Requirements:





You are someone who knows the fundamentals of operational research and when they should be applied through a relevant PhD or work experience.


Proven experience in developing and applying optimization models, algorithms, and metaheuristic techniques in a logistics or supply chain context.


You can translate fuzzy logistics and delivery problems or objectives into a well-thought-out algorithmic solution. You get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.


Strong programming skills in one of the languages such as Python, Rust, C, C++, or Java, with a focus on algorithm design rather than software engineering.


Experience in combinatorial optimisation problems.


A bias to simplicity, where you care most about achieving impact.





Nice to haves: 





Experience in solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) and/or building large scale delivery network simulations


Experience in discrete event simulations


Experience in any of the following areas: algorithms and data structures, parallel and distributed computing, high-performance computing 





Why Deliveroo




Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.




We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & Benefits




At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




Diversity




At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.




We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed.

LoanTube is a leading London-based FinTech and FCA Authorised Broker (FRN #753151), empowering individuals and businesses in the UK to access the right credit products to lead their best financial lives.




Our platform is seamlessly integrated into the UK lending ecosystem, delivering real-time, personalised credit offers tailored to users’ unique needs. Since pioneering transparent loan comparison in 2019, we now process over 100k credit applications every month from individuals and businesses alike.




Financial empowerment is at the heart of our mission – to make credit accessible and work for everyone, while maximising financial literacy.




In 2025, we’re doubling down on our commitment to drive financial inclusion for millions of consumers and small businesses left behind by legacy credit providers. We are doing this by further expanding our suite of seamless fintech products that deliver true financial innovation to those who need it most.




Our culture and values

We are a diverse, globally distributed team of innovators and engineers (spanning India, Brazil, the USA, and beyond) working in an incredibly fast-paced, agile environment. Relentless optimism, grit, and adaptability define our culture. If you thrive on challenges and want to help redefine lending, we’d love to hear from you.




At LoanTube, we believe it’s always day one. We’re proudly bootstrapped and self-sustaining, and we’re bringing our scrappy, all-hands-on-deck ethos into the next phase of our explosive growth.




Our culture is built for self-starters who love solving real-world problems. Every role is product-focused, self-motivated, and business-minded. If you’re not a fan of meetings, enjoy taking ownership, and dream of running a business someday, LoanTube is the place for you.




What makes us tick:

Extreme Ownership: We set a strategic roadmap as a team and empower individuals to lead. Your project > your process > your responsibility.
Collaborative Alignment: Weekly catch-ups ensure every key area of the business stays connected. No one operates in silos; we run the business together.
No Bureaucracy: Forget 1:1s and performance plans. Need to discuss something? Just wheel across the room :)
Win Together, Lose Together: Everyone here is an entrepreneur at heart. We focus on solutions, not blame, and move forward as a team to build products that truly serve our customers.
Learn by Doing: We love to tinker and figure things out. “I’ve never done this before” is a default Tuesday in the office.




If this sounds like the environment for you, keep reading!




The role

At LoanTube, we process vast amounts of data (1,000+ data points per application). Historically, we’ve adopted an 80/20 approach to leveraging this data across marketing and product. As our dedicated Data Scientist, your mission will be to transform this into a strategic advantage by driving our data efforts to the next level.




Sitting at the heart of the core team, you’ll gain a deep understanding of our business to uncover opportunities where advanced modelling can create the most value. From there, you will own the end-to-end lifecycle of model development – from opportunity sizing to deployment and monitoring – to deliver measurable business impact.




What you’ll do

Collaborate with colleagues across business domains to identify opportunities to generate value.
Build statistical/ML models that deliver tangible business results at scale.
Design and execute experiments/analysis to estimate the impact of potential projects.
Develop and maintain key metrics and reports for your initiatives.
Collaborate with the engineering team to constantly upgrade our data infrastructure.




Who you are

At least a Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Math, Stats, Physics, or Computer Science) and 2+ years of relevant work experience.
Experience creating statistical/ML models to solve business problems (customer segmentation, propensity to buy, credit risk etc). 
Proficiency in programming/modeling using Python and advanced querying using SQL.
Experience taking models from proofs of concept into production within highly scaled data infrastructure (BigQuery, Databricks, pipelines etc)
Business mindset. You’re comfortable linking abstract mathematical concepts to tangible business results.
You’re genuinely excited to work with us in the office – five days a week – embracing the energy and collaboration of being together.




Benefits

Competitive salary + generous profit-sharing / equity package.
20 paid holidays + a “duvet day” on your birthday + bank holidays.
£500 annual Learning and Development budget.
1 week work from anywhere policy.
Monthly company team events.
Top-tier office environment complemented by a complimentary on-site gym.
Prime office location in Hammersmith, with easy access to major Tube lines: Piccadilly, Circle, District, H&C.




Selection process

We’ve been on the other side of the table: companies who waste your time, job offers that don’t materialise, and technical tasks that don’t get reviewed.




So here’s our process:

30 min intro call with Dima – Growth Lead
30 min technical screening with Henrique – Product Lead (B2C)
Face-to-Face interview in the office with the Founders and our whole team

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.

Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

As an Economist at Deliveroo you will help scale our business and improve the experience for restaurants, riders, and eaters. Using experimental or observational data, you will get to help answer questions like:



Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?
What is the business impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?
Can the Delivery food market sustain multiple players?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants?
What impact do online reviews have?
How will a change in the user interface affect customer choice behaviour?



The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Requirements:



Masters Degree or PhD in Economics or Econometrics (preferred)
Always curious and willing to learn new skills
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business-relevant economic problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
Proficiency with analytical tools like R/Python and familiarity with SQL
Ideally industry experience since the completion of your academic career
Excellent people skills — you’ll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into economic problems



At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. The scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Why Deliveroo

Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.

We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

Workplace & Benefits

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.

Diversity

At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed.

Imagine being at the heart of a forward-thinking organisation, using data to influence big decisions that shape the future. From identifying the best retail offerings for a new site to forecasting workforce demand with precision, this role offers a chance to make a tangible difference.




You’ll join a team that’s already leveraging data to transform how decisions are made, but there’s so much more to do. For example, your work might guide decisions on whether a high-end coffee shop or a grab-and-go solution best suits the demographics of a new hospital location. Or you could dive into predictive modelling to anticipate short-term staff absences and reduce reliance on costly agency workers.




The insights you create will have a direct impact on revenue, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. This is a role where you’ll work across diverse areas – from pricing and consumer insights to facilities management – and collaborate with highly skilled professionals who are passionate about the value of data.




What You’ll Be Doing

Shaping Retail Decisions: Use demographic and transactional data to recommend optimal retail solutions for specific locations, helping maximise revenue and customer satisfaction.
Forecasting and Modelling: Build and refine predictive models for workforce planning and demand forecasting, helping to optimise staffing and reduce costs.
Consumer Insights: Analyse consumer behaviour and external benchmark data to influence pricing strategies and product offerings.
Collaborative Problem-Solving: Work closely with data engineers, business intelligence developers, and business leaders to turn data into actionable insights.
Operational Support: Support facilities management teams with KPI tracking and SLA performance analysis to improve efficiency.
Driving Impact: Focus on projects that deliver measurable value to the organisation’s P&L, ensuring that data solutions aren’t just interesting but truly impactful.




Who You Are

You’re someone who gets excited by solving problems with data. You thrive on turning raw data into actionable insights and enjoy collaborating with others to ensure those insights make a real difference. You’re comfortable balancing complex analysis with a pragmatic focus on delivering value.




Must-Have Skills and Experience:

A degree in Mathematics, Physics, or a related quantitative field (Master’s preferred).
3+ years’ experience in a data science role, with a strong foundation in:
Predictive modelling and forecasting.
Statistical analysis and mathematical problem-solving.
Delivering actionable insights to inform business decisions.
Strong communication skills, with the ability to explain complex concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
A collaborative mindset, with the ability to work across technical and business teams.

Desirable Skills:

Experience in consumer insights, pricing strategies, or customer behaviour analysis.
Familiarity with tools such as Python, R, or SQL.
Exposure to industries like retail, facilities management, or hospitality.
Knowledge of visualisation tools like Power BI or similar.




Why Join?

This isn’t just another data science role. It’s an opportunity to be part of a journey where data is becoming central to every decision. You’ll work in a supportive team that values innovation, collaboration, and results. With ambitious plans to embed more insights and advanced analytics into the business, you’ll have the chance to shape the future and grow with the role.
