Our AI-focused software connects distributors with their customers to operate waste-free and efficiently. A problem of this magnitude requires a massive scale and only the best people will be able to solve it. Are you in?

Here’s what we’re up to: https://bit.ly/4fyXonB

We are seeking a Staff Machine Learning Engineer ready to make a true impact.

At Choco we went within 16 months from 0 AI revenue to AI driving 100% of our new revenue. We took AI seriously, not for window dressing, but to bring us to our vision faster and to drive a significant part of our revenue. Because only when AI drives a majority of revenue is it at the core of the company.

We have assembled an absolutely world-class AI team that you will be working with. We work with cutting-edge tech and are an innovation driver in our industry and the broader European ecosystem.

You’ll need to be at the forefront of applied AI research and development, staying on top of industry advancements and constantly seeking ways to improve, validate, and deploy the latest models effectively. You must be an exceptional applied researcher with the ability to turn complex AI technologies into scalable, reliable systems in production. Excellence in engineering skills is a must, as you will be responsible for ensuring our AI models run efficiently, can scale, and meet the rigorous demands of our platform.

We’re looking for someone who thrives in a fast-paced, high-execution environment—someone who can learn quickly, adapt to new technologies, take ownership and deliver impactful solutions. You will collaborate with an amazing team, working alongside peers, engineers, and other experts to help us realize our ambitious vision. If you have a passion for AI, the drive to innovate, and the engineering skills to execute at the highest level, we want to hear from you.

Our current tech stack includes AWS serverless stack, Databricks + mlflow, Kubernetes, Kafka, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, Elastic Cloud, the newest models from different vendors incl. OpenAI, Python with common libraries and frameworks. For data transformations, we primarily use SQL, dbt & PySpark.

What You’ll Be Doing

We move fast. We commit to delivering user increments and advancing research on a weekly basis. Team members rotate between a variety of challenging problems. One week, you might be validating hypotheses and assumptions, demonstrating your conclusions in a defendable and reproducible way. The next week, you could be building a proof of concept, and in the third, you'll be shipping the first iteration of your work directly to our users.


Drive Choco's technical AI vision, roadmap, and projects alongside the rest of Data and Engineering leadership
Lead end-to-end development of AI and ML systems, incl. experimentation, deployment, optimization and monitoring
Collaborate with and be part of cross-functional teams to integrate sophisticated models into our systems
Carry the team through support, coaching, feedback, tooling, documentation, establishing best practices and knowledge sharing
Develop innovative solutions for complex business challenges


Your Responsibilities


Articulate a vision and long-term roadmap for AI at Choco, outlining immediate actionable steps to achieve it.
Understand and interpret complex business and customer challenges, translating them into actionable AI solutions.
Ensure AI systems are scalable, efficient, and effective.
This role requires you to be hands-on. You are expected to contribute to our codebase on a daily basis
Lead by example, demonstrating a strong work ethic, quick iterations, and a commitment to continuous delivery. Embrace and drive Choco's ambitious goals, thriving in a fast-paced, challenging startup environment.
Employ an agile approach, emphasizing swift delivery, responsiveness to feedback, and continuous improvement.


What We’re Looking For


Technical Leadership: You can think two, three steps ahead while not losing sight of what is important today. You have had demonstrable influence and impact on the success of the products you have worked on.
Expertise with LLMs: Hands-on experience with state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4, including safely deploying them in production environments. Familiarity with applications and architectures involving conversational agents, fine-tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Engineering Excellence: Strong programming and engineering skills, with the ability to design, build, and maintain scalable AI systems.
Communication and Collaboration: Clear, effective communication skills, with the ability to translate complex AI concepts into practical, actionable solutions for cross-functional teams.
Startup Mindset: Experience in fast-paced environments, with the ability to navigate ambiguity, take ownership of projects, and - most importantly - get shit done

We're looking for:


Solid experience as a QA Engineer or software tester, especially in web and mobile app testing (iOS and Android)
Comfortable starting with manual testing and developing towards automated testing
Hands-on experience with test automation tools like Selenium, Appium, and Playwright
Familiar with bug tracking systems and test case management

At Mojo, we're building the first sexually intelligent generation.

Sexual problems can be embarrassing, we've been there. That's why we're changing the narrative around issues in the bedroom.

Most importantly you will be in a position to identify how Mojo can have the biggest impact for our members. We are an app-first experience, meaning this impact will touch people all over the world.

As we are an early-stage start-up, there is room for you to have a huge impact on the future of the company and a large amount of autonomy to shape your role and get stuck in. You should be comfortable adapting your role and responsibilities as the company grows. We expect this might consist of:


Providing analyses to support product, marketing or finance
Owning tracking of business metrics by refining and maintaining reporting
Developing our best practices for experimentation methodology (eg A/B testing)
Developing data-driven projects, including applications of ML or modelling techniques
Working with leaders across Mojo to identify new opportunities in our AI product

Improving business data documentation
Supporting the refinement of our data infrastructure, architecture, and ETL processes
Collaboratively setting standards and ways of working with Data at Mojo
Building a self-serve data culture across the wider Mojo team through upskilling and accessible data tooling


We are building a team of people that have real ownership over the business. To be successful here, you should be willing to roll your sleeves up and get your hands dirty on anything that will help the business be more successful.

Requirements

You have:


2+ years of proven experience analyzing complex data with SQL, Python (& maybe R)
A degree or similar experience in a quantitative field (eg CompSci, Eng, Maths, Stats, Econ)
A good understanding of the dynamics of acquisition, engagement, retention and monetisation in a digital product

The biggest challenge AI companies face today is not half as glamorous as the outside world may think: it's all about data quality. In fact, the success of any AI application today relies on the quality of a model's training data — and for 95% of teams, this essential step is both the most costly, and the most time-consuming, in getting their product to market.

As ex-computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we felt first-hand how the lack of tools to prepare quality training data was impeding the progress of building AI. AI today is what the early days of computing or the internet were like, where the potential of the technology is clear, but the tools and processes surrounding it are still primitive, preventing the next generation of applications. This is why we started Encord.

We are a talented and ambitious team of 60, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning, backed by top investors, including CRV and Y Combinator, leading industry executives like Luc Vincent, former VP of AI at Meta, and other top Bay Area leaders in AI. We are one the fastest growing companies in our space, and consistently rated as the best tool in the market by our customers. We have big plans ahead and are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer to join us our ML team.

The role will be exposed to a broad tech stack (e.g. ReactJS, Python, REST & GraphQL, OpenCV, PyTorch, GCP, AWS & CUDA, Kubernetes) and the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning.

Qualifications

QualificationsThe right candidate will have a proven track record of relevant publications and previous experience managing applied research teams. Requirements for the role include:


Passion for solving ML problems- Strong experience in Python and machine learning libraries such as OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Fast.ai, and Keras- Strong experience in mathematical programming, algorithmic problem solving, and applied machine learning


What We Offer- Competitive salary, commission and equity in a hyper growth business.- Strong in-person culture: most of our team is in the office 3+ days a week.- Room to grow into anything you choose to — a year ago we were 25 people, now we're 60. We'll be growing insanely fast over the next 24 months and you'll have all the opportunities for growth as you can handle.- 25 days annual leave a year + public holidays.

Encord offers a unique opportunity to be part of a startup with a clear mission and vision. You will get to explore and build services enterprise AI use cases across many different industry verticals such as healthcare, surveillance, retail, agriculture and many more.

We are home to some of the world's leading experts on autonomous vehicles, creating solutions such as Oxa Driver, equipping vehicles with full self-driving functionality; Oxa MetaDriver, using Generative AI to accelerate and assure the safety of deployments; and Oxa Hub, a set of cloud-based offerings for autonomous fleet management. Our technology is being deployed across the UK and the U.S, and we're partnering with a fast-growing ecosystem of operators, vehicle OEMs and equipment makers serving autonomous transportation globally as it advances.

Based in Oxford, and with offices in Canada and the U.S, Oxa was founded in 2014 and is  growing rapidly (350+ ‘Oxbots' to date). Our purpose is to change the way the Earth moves, through an uncompromising focus on safety, efficiency and explainability of our AI approaches. The company has attracted $225 million from leading investors so far, with $140 million raised in the last Series C funding round in January 2023.

Your Team

Oxa Foundry is a suite of tools that combines generative AI, digital twins and simulation to accelerate machine learning and testing of self-driving technology before and during real-world use.Tools within Oxa Foundry are also unlocking new opportunities to launch innovative solutions for industries such as commercial fleet insurance and risk management. Leveraging Oxa's experience of deploying AVs and establishing capabilities to safely scale (by identifying, quantifying and managing route risk with limited or no pre-existing data), we are helping organisations in those markets augment and generate new data to develop transformative fleet risk management solutions for their own customers.

Your team will ensure the company has enough data of the right kind and the right time from the right sources to sustain rapid improvement across all its tools. It will ensure suitable data ownership across our own fleet and via our customers and partners using data synthesis and expansion, simulation, automatic annotation and logging where appropriate.

We are home to some of the world's leading experts on autonomous vehicles, creating solutions such as Oxa Driver, equipping vehicles with full self-driving functionality; Oxa MetaDriver, using Generative AI to accelerate and assure the safety of deployments; and Oxa Hub, a set of cloud-based offerings for autonomous fleet management. Our technology is being deployed across the UK and the U.S, and we're partnering with a fast-growing ecosystem of operators, vehicle OEMs and equipment makers serving autonomous transportation globally as it advances.

Based in Oxford, and with offices in Canada and the U.S, Oxa was founded in 2014 and is  growing rapidly (350+ ‘Oxbots' to date). Our purpose is to change the way the Earth moves, through an uncompromising focus on safety, efficiency and explainability of our AI approaches. The company has attracted $225 million from leading investors so far, with $140 million raised in the last Series C funding round in January 2023.

Your Team

Oxa Foundry is a suite of tools that combines generative AI, digital twins and simulation to accelerate machine learning and testing of self-driving technology before and during real-world use.Tools within Oxa Foundry are also unlocking new opportunities to launch innovative solutions for industries such as commercial fleet insurance and risk management. Leveraging Oxa's experience of deploying AVs and establishing capabilities to safely scale (by identifying, quantifying and managing route risk with limited or no pre-existing data), we are helping organisations in those markets augment and generate new data to develop transformative fleet risk management solutions for their own customers.

Your team will ensure the company has enough data of the right kind and the right time from the right sources to sustain rapid improvement across all its tools. It will ensure suitable data ownership across our own fleet and via our customers and partners using data synthesis and expansion, simulation, automatic annotation and logging where appropriate.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$162,300 - C$243,500. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.
