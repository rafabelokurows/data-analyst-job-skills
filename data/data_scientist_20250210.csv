At DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.

DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

Twitch is the world’s biggest live streaming service, with global communities built around gaming, entertainment, music, sports, cooking, and more. It is where thousands of communities come together for whatever, every day.

We’re about community, inside and out. You’ll find coworkers who are eager to team up, collaborate, and smash (or elegantly solve) problems together. We’re on a quest to empower live communities, so if this sounds good to you, see what we’re up to on LinkedIn and Twitter, and discover the projects we’re solving on our Blog. Be sure to explore our Interviewing Guide to learn how to ace our interview process.

About The Team

The Community Discovery Machine Learning (CDML) team powers the systems that help millions of active viewers find the creators and communities they'll enjoy most. Powering the home page recommendations, browse, search, and feed ranking experiences, this team and its algorithms are at the heart of enabling the connections that make Twitch a great place for so many users.

About The Role

Data is critical to the algorithms that power the recommendation, search, and ranking systems. It's also critical to making decisions, especially working on systems that are themselves data-driven. As a Senior Data Scientist on the CDML team, you'll be responsible for helping drive improvements to the machine learning systems as well as analytics to drive decision-making.

While there is a team of Applied Scientists building and shipping the algorithms themselves, data science can help improve these systems directly. In this role, you can identify and build new signals to input into the models. We're also working on the value model that the algorithm optimizes, and your input will be critical to understanding the tradeoffs and balancing multiple objectives in a scientific way.

We also still have big unanswered analytics questions to solve. How often do viewers just want to get to the content they already know they want to watch, and when are they open to exploring new channels? These are the sorts of questions you'll be tackling.

You can work in San Francisco, CA; New York, NY; or Seattle, WA.

You Will:



Inform product strategies by defining and updating core metrics for each initiative
Estimate the opportunity sizing of new features the team could take on
Identify and build new signals to incorporate into the algorithms driving recommendations, search, and feed ranking at Twitch
Identify metric tradeoff ratios that help inform value model choices, long-term impact from early-growth-funnel users, and other product decisions
Establish analytical framework for your team: ad-hoc analysis, automated dashboards, and self-service reporting tools to surface key data to stakeholders
Design A/B experiments to drive product direction with iterative innovation and measurement
Work hand-in-hand with business, product, engineering, and design to proactively influence and inform teammates' decisions throughout the product life cycle
Distill ambiguous product or business questions, find clever ways to answer them, and to quantify the uncertainty



You Have:



BA/BS in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or equivalent industry experience
5+ years of experience as a data scientist or data analyst in a high velocity, data-driven environment
5+ years of machine learning/statistical modeling data analysis tools and techniques, and parameters that affect their performance experience
Expert SQL skills and proficiency in Python/R
Experience using data to create insight, drive business decisions and influence leadership



Bonus Points



MS/MA or higher in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related technical field
Experience working on algorithms powering large-scale consumer services
Experience in a data science team working on customer software products, analytics, and insights
Experience working with software development and operational event data
Familiarity with Twitch, either as a viewer or creator (or both!)



Perks



Medical, Dental, Vision & Disability Insurance
401(k)
Maternity & Parental Leave
Flexible PTO

About DoorDash

At DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.

DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Statement of Non-Discrimination: In keeping with our beliefs and goals, no employee or applicant will face discrimination or harassment based on: race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital/domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability status, or veteran status. Above and beyond discrimination and harassment based on “protected categories,” we also strive to prevent other subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (i.e., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at DoorDash. We value a diverse workforce – people who identify as women, non-binary or gender non-conforming, LGBTQIA+, American Indian or Native Alaskan, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, differently-abled, caretakers and parents, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply. Thank you to the Level Playing Field Institute for this statement of non-discrimination.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth Team aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision making.
You will conduct analysis to identify opportunities for your team and help shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don’t exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You have worked on a growth team.
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $166,000 - $195,000 per year.

By clicking “Submit Application”, I understand and agree that Notion and its affiliates and subsidiaries will collect and process my information in accordance with Notion’s Global Recruiting Privacy Policy.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth Team aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision making.
You will conduct analysis to identify opportunities for your team and help shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don’t exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You have worked on a growth team.
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $166,000 - $195,000 per year.

By clicking “Submit Application”, I understand and agree that Notion and its affiliates and subsidiaries will collect and process my information in accordance with Notion’s Global Recruiting Privacy Policy.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth Team aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision making.
You will conduct analysis to identify opportunities for your team and help shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don’t exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You have worked on a growth team.
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

In this unique role, you’ll work at the intersection of Product, Engineering, Growth, and Finance to drive the success of Notion’s AI business — one of our fastest-growing and most innovative areas.

You’ll partner across these teams to identify growth opportunities, develop insights that deepen our understanding of the business and users, support new product bets, and evaluate the ROI of our AI investments.

What You'll Achieve


You will analyze the drivers of the AI business and the lifecycle of our paying AI customers, and inform strategic decisions about how to monetize and package our AI features.
You will support the launch of new AI products throughout the product development process, and deliver proactive insights on potential opportunities for driving AI adoption.
You will partner with Product and Strategic Finance to connect AI feature usage with business outcomes, helping us set better goals, create more accurate forecasts, and monitor progress.
You will partner with Strategic Finance and Engineering to optimize our AI infrastructure costs.
You will design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features and growth initiatives.
You will create self-service tools and reports that empower partner teams and leadership to understand and track key metrics.
You will collaborate with Data Engineering to build core data models that power operational and exploratory data analyses.



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have 5+ years of experience in analytics and data science, with experience collaborating with growth, finance, business operations, product, or engineering teams.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have excellent communication skills and a proven track record of partnering with cross-functional teams to drive impact through data-informed decisions.
You have strong analytical skills and can bring structure to ambiguous problems with limited data. You can solve deeply complex problems without losing sight of the big picture.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.
You are comfortable working in a fast-paced environment with rapid iteration.



Nice To Haves


You have experience supporting AI features or products.
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have experience with financial modeling.

When you work with us, you tackle tough problems alongside other scientists and engineers. People who will challenge your ideas. Who you can really learn from, and collaborate with.

Join our reading circles to stay up to date on the latest research papers in your fields
Attend academic seminars to learn from thought leaders from top universities
The internship program lasts 10 weeks in the summer and takes place at our Soho-based, New York City office. You will partner with an assigned mentor and work on a single project during the course of your time here, which will culminate in a final presentation at the conclusion of the program.

You Will Enjoy The Following Benefits


Perks: Onsite gyms with laundry service, wellness activities, casual dress, snacks, game rooms
Hybrid Work Policy: Flexible in-office days with budget for home office setup

Autonomy to pursue your role and interests with room to grow, with a team behind you that always has your back
Joy, humor, and a little dose of healthy competition (in our business, we win as a team; on company game night, may the best Arthurian win...)



We offer


Competitive compensation plus medical, dental, and vision insurance, and a 401K (with matching)
Our target base salary range for this role is $160,000 - $230,000, based on level of experience and how your skills align with role requirements

Fast-growing measurement company looking for a Data Scientist with 3-5 years of experience to work with our Data Science team to help build the AU and drive our measurement product forward.

Who We Are

Adelaide is the leader in one of the fastest-growing areas of digital advertising: attention metrics.

Since 2020, we’ve been a trusted measurement partner for 40% of Fortune 50 companies. They rely on our metric, AU, to maximize the effectiveness of media spend. AU is “the attention economy's most widely recognized metric,” according to Adweek, and we swept the measurement category in the 2024 Adexchanger awards.

Our business is growing rapidly—we’ve doubled revenue in just 18 months and grew our team by 45% last year. Earlier this year, in partnership with The New York Times, we launched Adelaide for Publishers, the next step in our vision to create a more fair and equitable marketplace for media.

Adelaide is backed by prominent investors such as Human Ventures (Joe Marchese), Aperiam Ventures (Joe Zawadzki & Eric Franchi), WGI (Jonah Goodhart), and Irwin Gotlieb.

While we have an office in NYC, we’re very remote-friendly and support flexible work arrangements.

How We Operate

We are a team of action-oriented doers; management rolls up their sleeves to contribute daily. Our culture is rooted in curiosity and loosely held but rigorously vetted opinions; everyone is encouraged to contribute to planning and strategy.

Position Overview

This position reports to the Director of Data Science; it will help to continue pushing forward the underlying models and data sets that create the AU, and work closely with product and client services team members to develop new data products and methodologies in support of all areas of the business.

In this role, you will be joining a team of other data scientists and data engineers, and work with people across the organization to shape Adelaide’s data into a clear and concise story. You’ll be responsible for working with hundreds of millions of data points a day, quickly iterating on optimization methods that further advertising effectiveness and fuel the world’s first attention-based optimization platform. Day-to-day activities range from identifying and exploring new data sources, to training new models and iterating on existing models, to improving our codebase and pipelines.

This is a fully remote position within the United States, with opportunities to connect with colleagues at our New York office.

What You'll Learn

An important part of our culture is continuing education and the sharing of ideas. We offer:


A large network of investors and advisors for you to access that will help your team succeed
Mentorship from executives with decades of experience in adtech and media
Regular internal knowledge-sharing sessions
Education budget to accelerate your team’s development


Specifically, In This Role, You Will Learn


Gain a deep understanding of attention metrics and media quality measurement
Complex user interaction patterns and ML solutions to account for specialized data sets
Methods for processing and deriving insights from massive amounts of user experience signals
Best practices and collaborative product development in a fast-paced collaborative environment


Core Responsibilities


Interpret raw data and form compelling narratives to draw meaningful insights that communicate our story and mission
Work with our Data Science team, as well as Product and Customer Success, to shape Adelaide’s data into a clear and concise story
Help to formulate, develop, and optimize models in production
Help to support and augment our machine learning system to aid advertisers in buying efficient media
Support client management teams with data-driven insights based on millions of behavioral data points each day
Work with the engineering team to build efficient and robust data pipelines
Help direct experimental studies aimed at understanding advertising value across multiple channels and media environments

In the AI Era, modern technology should be at the backbone of supply chains, but the world is not quite there yet. From retail stores all the way up to large-scale enterprise, professionals are craving tech solutions to run supply chain operations in much better ways, saving money and reducing the environmental footprint on our planet.

That’s why we are building Cargoful, an AI-based SaaS company that wants to elevate supply chains to the level they should be at.

We are a small team of young and international professionals who want to change how supply chains are run, from the ground up. We come from top companies and research centres (MIT, McKinsey, NASA, London Business School, Leonardo, Politecnico di Milano, Sant’Anna), we are backed by leading institutions from the Silicon Valley (Berkeley SkyDeck) and Italy (s2capital, B4i) and driven by a strong will to make things happen.

We are looking for individuals to join us in building the supply chain tech of the future.

🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🇮🇹 🇨🇭




Responsibilities

Our new team member will work directly with our Chief Analytics Officer, and in collaboration with the rest of the engineering team, to design, create and deploy Optimization and Machine Learning algorithms.




Examples of activities you will perform: 

Create geo-spatial forecasting models to predict demand for last-mile deliveries
Optimize large scale combinatorial problems using Operations Research algorithms (metaheuristics, genetic algorithms or exact methods)
Build datapipeline to extract insights from vast amounts of GPS datapoints
Develop custom clustering algorithms to speed up optimization model
Collaborate closely with the Software Engineering team to deploy all model in production within a real Web Application




What we offer:

A driver’s seat in a small, selected and very ambitious team. At Cargoful, every single individual matters and is crucial in transforming our vision into reality. WhatsApp only had 50 employees when sold to Facebook for $16 billion in 2014. What can we achieve in the era of one-person-billion-dollar companies? Let’s find out together.
Direct exposure to complex problems with no easy solutions. Building groundbreaking technology isn't smooth - we confront an endless stream of technical and managerial challenges that will test you rigorously and drive you to learn and improve. We all aspire to be the best professionals we can be, and to achieve this, we push ourselves hard.
Ownership, responsibility, impact. Cargoful is already powering the supply chains of large multinational corporations - there's significant room for accountability and little margin for error. Each of us takes ownership, cares for the rest of the team, and stands up when needed




What we don't offer

Regularity & smooth sailing. Every day is completely different from the previous one. The span of activities is extremely wide but we expect you to become a “little” expert in a variety of different fields. Your team-mates and clients will rely on you – that means you’ll need to be there when they need you.
The safe heaven of standards and procedures. We are building a brand new company and pre-cooked processes do not exists for us. We expect you to contribute to design how the company processes should look like in 2-5 years from now rather than adapting to rules.




Qualifications

Experience: 1-2 years
Education: Engineering, Math, Data science, Statistics or Physics degree
Language: At least B2 level (Intermediate) in English
Set-up: hybrid, 3 days/week in presence in our Milan office (Porta Romana)




Application instructions

To apply send an email to cosmo@cargoful.tech with a short intro of yourself. Attach your resume/CV and make sure it follows these rules: it's one-page only (no Europass), it includes relevant work experence (sorted by date descending), it includes university grades. Applications sent solely via LinkedIn won't be considered.

Présentation de l’entrepôt de données du CHU

Le CHU de Poitiers est lauréat de l’appel à projets « Accompagnement et soutien à la constitution d’Entrepôts de Données de Santé hospitaliers » soutenu par France 2030. Le plan « France 2030 », doté de 54 milliards d’euros déployés sur 5 ans, vise à développer la compétitivité industrielle et les technologies d’avenir à l’horizon 2030. Cet entrepôt de données permettra aux chercheurs un accès aux données dans un cadre technique et sécurisé.

De nombreuses informations médicales sont mentionnées en texte libre et sont présentes dans les comptes-rendus, courriers et notes médicales. L’intégration de ces informations nécessite le déploiement d’un pipeline de traitement automatique de la langue (TAL) complet : extraction du contenu textuel des documents dans différents formats (doc, docx, pdf), pseudonymisation, reconnaissances d’entités nommées, annotation sémantique, chargement dans l’entrepôt de données et indexation. De plus, les projets de recherche nécessitent souvent des développements spécifiques visant à extraire des informations précises ou à classifier automatiquement des documents médicaux.

Certains développements seront réalisés en collaboration avec les équipes des CHU de Bordeaux et de Limoges dans une vision d’infrastructure régionalisée en Nouvelle-Aquitaine.

Présentation de l’entrepôt de données du CHU

Le CHU de Poitiers est lauréat de l’appel à projets « Accompagnement et soutien à la constitution d’Entrepôts de Données de Santé hospitaliers » soutenu par France 2030. Le plan « France 2030 », doté de 54 milliards d’euros déployés sur 5 ans, vise à développer la compétitivité industrielle et les technologies d’avenir à l’horizon 2030. Cet entrepôt de données permettra aux chercheurs un accès aux données dans un cadre technique et sécurisé.

De nombreuses informations médicales sont mentionnées en texte libre et sont présentes dans les comptes-rendus, courriers et notes médicales. L’intégration de ces informations nécessite le déploiement d’un pipeline de traitement automatique de la langue (TAL) complet : extraction du contenu textuel des documents dans différents formats (doc, docx, pdf), pseudonymisation, reconnaissances d’entités nommées, annotation sémantique, chargement dans l’entrepôt de données et indexation. De plus, les projets de recherche nécessitent souvent des développements spécifiques visant à extraire des informations précises ou à classifier automatiquement des documents médicaux.

Certains développements seront réalisés en collaboration avec les équipes des CHU de Bordeaux et de Limoges dans une vision d’infrastructure régionalisée en Nouvelle-Aquitaine.
