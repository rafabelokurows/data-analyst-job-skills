Are you proud of your technical skills, commercial head and ability to get shit done? You're reading the right job description. We want someone who is inspired to work in tech for good and is jumping out of bed in the morning because the idea of using their skills to improve the lives of millions of potential customers all over the world, gets them going.

Before we talk about our product and mission, let's be clear that although we're tackling men's sexual problems right now, you don't need to be a guy to apply. We want to hear from candidates of all genders. We believe that if we solve these problems, everyone will benefit.

At Mojo, we're building the first sexually intelligent generation.

Sexual problems can be embarrassing, we've been there. That's why we're changing the narrative around issues in the bedroom.

We believe that good sex starts in your head, so we're not here to push pills or offer quick fixes to the 50% of Millennials and Gen Z who now suffer with psychological issues in the bedroom. Nope, hyper-personalised AI Therapists are created by the world's best sexual wellbeing specialists to help our members lead thriving and healthy relationships 💪. We are looking for someone who is excited to be part of that.

We've had crazy global growth, with over 600,000 members in 150 countries and counting. We're backed by Europe's top VC firms, and you might even have seen us on the front cover of the Sunday Times.

The Role

You'll work closely with the founders, report to our Chief of Staff and take ownership of much of our data stack. You will be given free reign to spearhead new strategic data projects while helping to set data standards in the company. You'll have the opportunity to guide and enable the whole Mojo team across Product, Growth, Marketing and Ops to make good data driven decisions. Most importantly you will be in a position to identify how Mojo can have the biggest impact for our members. We are an app-first experience, meaning this impact will touch people all over the world.

As we are an early-stage start-up, there is room for you to have a huge impact on the future of the company and a large amount of autonomy to shape your role and get stuck in. You should be comfortable adapting your role and responsibilities as the company grows. We expect this might consist of:


Providing analyses to support product, marketing or finance
Owning tracking of business metrics by refining and maintaining reporting
Developing our best practices for experimentation methodology (eg A/B testing)
Developing data-driven projects, including applications of ML or modelling techniques
Working with leaders across Mojo to identify new opportunities in our AI product
Performing analyses to answer open-ended questions and provide strategic advice
Improving business data documentation
Supporting the refinement of our data infrastructure, architecture, and ETL processes
Collaboratively setting standards and ways of working with Data at Mojo
Building a self-serve data culture across the wider Mojo team through upskilling and accessible data tooling


We are building a team of people that have real ownership over the business. To be successful here, you should be willing to roll your sleeves up and get your hands dirty on anything that will help the business be more successful.

Requirements

You have:


2+ years of proven experience analyzing complex data with SQL, Python (& maybe R)
A degree or similar experience in a quantitative field (eg CompSci, Eng, Maths, Stats, Econ)
A good understanding of the dynamics of acquisition, engagement, retention and monetisation in a digital product
Strong understanding of statistical concepts and practical experience applying them (e.g. causal inference, ML, A/B tests)
Experience building data visualizations and dashboards (e.g., looker studio or others)
Ability to work collaboratively and proactively in a fast-paced environment
A commercial head and can put numbers into business perspective
Great communication skills - in person, writing, and code; to technical or non-technical audiences
Compassion, empathy, understanding, or interest in mental health
Ability to keep up-to-date with the latest tools and trends



Benefits


Industry-leading salary £60-70k, with chunky seed round equity package
Private health, optical, audiological, and dental insurance with Vitality Health
Hybrid working, 3 days in and 2 days out, with great offices in Old Street
Three remote working fortnights a year (read more in our handbook)
37 days off (inc 28 holidays, 3 end-of-year, 8 bank holidays, 1 volunteering)
Parental leave for primary and secondary caregivers
Workplace nursery benefit and emergency child-sitting allowance
Monthly team outings
£500 personal wellbeing budget

The Data + Science Team




At Deliveroo we have a world-class data & science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We have over 200 Machine Learning Engineers, Data Scientists, Data Analysts, and Analytics Engineers working throughout the company in product, business and platform teams.




We have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things.




The Role




We are hiring several Senior and mid-level MLE positions in many different teams across all sides of our marketplace (consumer, delivery, restaurants, grocery, and retail). Our interview process is team-agnostic.




As an MLE, you will develop the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo. You will work in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. Your team has independence and works at some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of our three-sided marketplace (riders, consumers, and restaurants). We evaluate the performance of all our decision-making machines through our world-class experimentation platform.




Depending on the team you join, you will build intelligent decision-making machines that may:





Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real-time delays.


Work out how many riders we need in a particular place at a particular time.


Optimise consumer and rider fees.


Improve the consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes.


Detect fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants.


Assist restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish.





Requirements





3+ years' experience as a ML Engineer or Data Scientist


3+ years' experience in Python


Experience productionising ML models


Experience using tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, CircleCI


You know the fundamentals of machine learning and when they should be applied


You can translate an unstructured business problem into a well-thought-out algorithmic solution


You get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business


You have a bias to simplicity, where you care most about achieving impact





The Company




Our mission is to be the definitive food company. We are transforming the way the world eats by making food more convenient and accessible. We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & Benefits




At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




Diversity




At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.




We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed

Collaborating with cross-functional technology teams to gather requirements and ensure the solutions align with business objectives
Helping integrate the team’s solutions (including GenAI) into existing systems and platforms to provide seamless user experiences and scale adoption.
Actively participating in code reviews, experiment design and tooling decisions to help drive the team’s velocity and quality
Helping build data and machine learning expertise within the business through knowledge sharing

Extensive experience exploring and extracting insights from heterogeneous multi-dimensional data sets, and presenting complex data visually
Time series modelling (both machine-learning and econometric approaches)
Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS) and containerization technologies (Docker)
Excellent problem-solving skills, ability to work independently and in a team
Strong communication skills, with the ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
Understanding of ML fundamentals and experience with ML frameworks
Advanced coursework in math, statistics, and machine learning preferred
Demonstrable attention to detail


Desired Experience


Experience in the energy or commodities trading industry, with knowledge of financial markets and trading concepts
Experience integrating machine learning systems into interactive dashboards (e.g. Dash, Streamlit) and present use cases of machine learning to non-technical colleagues
Application of a wide range of ML methodologies to real life applications
Enterprise software development (systems design, code review, version control, etc.)
Data orchestrators (Airflow, Dagster) and cloud-based ETL/ELT pipelines
Awareness of continuous integration and delivery concepts/technologies

At Faculty, we transform organisational performance through safe, impactful and human-centric AI.

With a decade of experience, we provide over 300 global customers with software, bespoke AI consultancy, and Fellows from our award winning Fellowship programme.

Our expert team brings together leaders from across government, academia and global tech giants to solve the biggest challenges in applied AI.

Should you join us, you’ll have the chance to work with, and learn from, some of the brilliant minds who are bringing Frontier AI to the frontlines of the world.

We operate a hybrid way of working, meaning that you'll split your time across client location, Faculty's Old Street office and working from home depending on the needs of the project. For this role, you can expect to be client-side for up-to three days per week at times and working either from home or our Old street office for the rest of your time.

About The Role

You will design, build, and deploy production-grade software, infrastructure, and MLOps systems that leverage machine learning. The work you do will help our customers solve a broad range of high-impact problems in our Defence team - examples of which can be found here.

Because of the potential to work with our clients in the National Security space, you will need to be eligible for Security Clearance, details of which are outlined when you click through to apply.

What You'll Be Doing

You are engineering-focused, with a keen interest and working knowledge of operationalised machine learning. You have a desire to take cutting-edge ML applications into the real world. You will develop new methodologies and champion best practices for managing AI systems deployed at scale, with regard to technical, ethical and practical requirements. You will support both technical, and non-technical stakeholders, to deploy ML to solve real-world problems.

Our Machine Learning Engineerings Are Responsible For The Engineering Aspects Of Our Customer Delivery Projects. As a Machine Learning Engineer, You’ll Be Essential To Helping Us Achieve That Goal By:


Building software and infrastructure that leverages Machine Learning;
Creating reusable, scalable tools to enable better delivery of ML systems
Working with our customers to help understand their needs
Working with data scientists and engineers to develop best practices and new technologies; and
Implementing and developing Faculty’s view on what it means to operationalise ML software.


As a Rapidly Growing Organisation, Roles Are Dynamic And Subject To Change. Your Role Will Evolve Alongside Business Needs, But You Can Expect Your Key Responsibilities To Include:


Working in cross-functional teams of engineers, data scientists, designers and managers to deliver technically sophisticated, high-impact systems.
Working with senior engineers to scope projects and design systems
Providing technical expertise to our customers
Technical Delivery


Who We're Looking For

We Like People Who Combine Expertise And Ambition With Optimism -- Who Are Interested In Changing The World For The Better -- And Have The Drive And Intelligence To Make It Happen. If You’re The Right Candidate For Us, You Probably:


Think scientifically, even if you’re not a scientist - you test assumptions, seek evidence and are always looking for opportunities to improve the way we do things.
Love finding new ways to solve old problems - when it comes to your work and professional development, you don’t believe in ‘good enough’. You always seek new ways to solve old challenges.
Are pragmatic and outcome-focused - you know how to balance the big picture with the little details and know a great idea is useless if it can’t be executed in the real world.


To Succeed In This Role, You’ll Need The Following - These Are Illustrative Requirements And We Don’t Expect All Applicants To Have Experience In Everything (70% Is a Rough Guide):


Understanding of, and experience with the full machine learning lifecycle
Working with Data Scientists to deploy trained machine learning models into production environments
Working with a range of models developed using common frameworks such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
Experience with software engineering best practices and developing applications in Python.
Technical experience of cloud architecture, security, deployment, and open-source tools ideally with one of the 3 major cloud providers (AWS, GPS or Azure)
Demonstrable experience with containers and specifically Docker and Kubernetes
An understanding of the core concepts of probability and statistics and familiarity with common supervised and unsupervised learning techniques
Demonstrable experience of managing/mentoring more junior members of the team
Outstanding verbal and written communication.
Excitement about working in a dynamic role with the autonomy and freedom you need to take ownership of problems and see them through to execution


What We Can Offer You:

The Faculty team is diverse and distinctive, and we all come from different personal, professional and organisational backgrounds. We all have one thing in common: we are driven by a deep intellectual curiosity that powers us forward each day.

Faculty is the professional challenge of a lifetime. You’ll be surrounded by an impressive group of brilliant minds working to achieve our collective goals.

Our consultants, product developers, business development specialists, operations professionals and more all bring something unique to Faculty, and you’ll learn something new from everyone you meet.

The electricity grid is changing beyond recognition, and without deploying new software to orchestrate it, we'll be unable to decarbonise.

At Axle, we're building the infrastructure that'll underpin the decarbonised energy system. Our software crushes CO2 and energy costs. Our goal is insanely ambitious, and we're building a team to match the scale of this challenge. We've just raised a Seed round from world-leading investors including Accel (TechCrunch) and we're growing fast.

We make the technology to move energy usage to times when electricity is cheap and green. Our software controls vehicle charging, heating systems, and home batteries. We use machine learning to figure out what energy people will need, and when they'll need it. We control tens of thousands of energy assets, and we're growing quickly.

Axle is a unique startup. We're building in a legacy industry and moving gigawatt-hours of electrons in the real world, but we operate at lightning speed. We ship extraordinarily quickly, and we're experts in electricity systems. We're backed by some of the best investors in the world, and we're growing the team to meet customer demand.

Requirements

Read more about what we're building here.

You can expect:


insane amounts of ownership
hard technical challenges
that what you build is commercially and environmentally valuable



In return, we ask for:


the courage to build new things fast
a commitment to real world impact over technical perfection
a desire to help build and lead an exceptional and tight knit team
deep-seated motivation to combat climate change



And it'd be nice if you could bring:


knowledge of the electricity system, specifically power trading
comfort speaking to clients (we're a small team and we all wear many hats)
familiarity with time-series data



Interview process


Initial interview
Take-home exercise
Final interview (in-person)
Offer, references, and welcome to the team!


Tech stack

🐍 We do everything in Python, because it allows data scientists and engineers to collaborate closely and move quickly. Our data scientists write lots of production code. We ❤️ Streamlit.

🎨 We try a bunch of things in Figma before we build them in code, because it's a fast and cheap way to get feedback.

🐋 Everything we build lives in Docker, for minimal cross-platform faff and maximal reproducibility.

☁️ We deploy on GCP but don't feel strongly about it.

Benefits

We love the idea of fully remote work but it doesn't... work. For very early stage companies, people learn faster, get on better, and accomplish more when they're spending a decent chunk of time together. We ask that you spend 2-3 days a week in our London office.

We are extremely keen to build a diverse company, and we're particularly eager to hear from candidates who don't fit the traditional engineering stereotypes. If you're motivated by our mission, please do reach out, even if you feel you might not ‘check all the boxes'.

At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.




Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.




Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.




As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is to maximise business impact within one of many business areas. You will help answer questions like:





Which markets/cities should we enter next?


How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?


What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?


How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?


What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?


How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?


What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?


How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?





The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.




Requirements





A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)


Experience conducting A/B experiments


Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences


A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset


Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems


A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail


A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact


Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems





Why DeliverooOur mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.




We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & BenefitsAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




DiversityAt Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.




We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know.
