AWS Infrastructure Services owns the design, planning, delivery, and operation of all AWS global infrastructure. In other words, we’re the people who keep the cloud running. We support all AWS data centers and all of the servers, storage, networking, power, and cooling equipment that ensure our customers have continual access to the innovation they rely on. We work on the most challenging problems, with thousands of variables impacting the supply chain — and we’re looking for talented people who want to help.

You’ll join a diverse team of software, hardware, and network engineers, supply chain specialists, security experts, operations managers, and other vital roles. You’ll collaborate with people across AWS to help us deliver the highest standards for safety and security while providing seemingly infinite capacity at the lowest possible cost for our customers. And you’ll experience an inclusive culture that welcomes bold ideas and empowers you to own them to completion.

In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge and made a commitment to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040 —10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. We invited others to join us and there are now more than 300 businesses and organizations across 51 industries and 29 countries that have signed the Pledge, which means we are collectively coming at the climate crisis from nearly every sector and nearly every angle.

As part of our efforts to decarbonize our business, we became the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in 2020, and last year, we reached 85% renewable energy across our business, and are on a path to power our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025.

We recently announced that AWS will be water positive by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations. The company also announced its 2021 global water use efficiency (WUE) metric of 0.25 liters of water per kilowatt-hour, demonstrating AWS’s leadership in water efficiency among cloud providers. To learn more about AWS’s water+ commitment visit: Water Stewardship.

Come join the team that is building the tools and innovative technology to manage our growing portfolio of renewable energy investments, including solar, on-shore and off-shore wind farms.

Key job responsibilities

As an data scientist, you will employ machine learning and analytics to create scalable solutions for problems in sustainable energy space. You will dissect large historical business data sets to enhance and streamline essential processes. You will partner with data and software teams to create models for predictive insights and establish automated methods for large data analysis.

AWS Infrastructure Services owns the design, planning, delivery, and operation of all AWS global infrastructure. In other words, we’re the people who keep the cloud running. We support all AWS data centers and all of the servers, storage, networking, power, and cooling equipment that ensure our customers have continual access to the innovation they rely on. We work on the most challenging problems, with thousands of variables impacting the supply chain — and we’re looking for talented people who want to help.

You’ll join a diverse team of software, hardware, and network engineers, supply chain specialists, security experts, operations managers, and other vital roles. You’ll collaborate with people across AWS to help us deliver the highest standards for safety and security while providing seemingly infinite capacity at the lowest possible cost for our customers. And you’ll experience an inclusive culture that welcomes bold ideas and empowers you to own them to completion.

In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge and made a commitment to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040 —10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. We invited others to join us and there are now more than 300 businesses and organizations across 51 industries and 29 countries that have signed the Pledge, which means we are collectively coming at the climate crisis from nearly every sector and nearly every angle.

As part of our efforts to decarbonize our business, we became the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in 2020, and last year, we reached 85% renewable energy across our business, and are on a path to power our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025.

We recently announced that AWS will be water positive by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations. The company also announced its 2021 global water use efficiency (WUE) metric of 0.25 liters of water per kilowatt-hour, demonstrating AWS’s leadership in water efficiency among cloud providers. To learn more about AWS’s water+ commitment visit: Water Stewardship.

Come join the team that is building the tools and innovative technology to manage our growing portfolio of renewable energy investments, including solar, on-shore and off-shore wind farms.

Key job responsibilities

As an data scientist, you will employ machine learning and analytics to create scalable solutions for problems in sustainable energy space.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth Team aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision making.
You will conduct analysis to identify opportunities for your team and help shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don’t exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You have worked on a growth team.
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth Team aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision making.
You will conduct analysis to identify opportunities for your team and help shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don’t exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You have worked on a growth team.
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $166,000 - $195,000 per year.

By clicking “Submit Application”, I understand and agree that Notion and its affiliates and subsidiaries will collect and process my information in accordance with Notion’s Global Recruiting Privacy Policy.

Iemand die samen met ons wil groeien!




ACA’s Innovation Lab is het nieuwe businessconcept van ACA Group. In ons Innovation Lab groeien innovatieve ideeën uit tot gevalideerde businessconcepten.




Hoe wij (samen)werken

Omdat wij een relatief nieuw team zijn, hanteren we geen ‘business-as-usual’ proces. We werken in een dynamische omgeving die eigenlijk vergelijkbaar is met een start-up binnen een groter geheel. ACA investeert een substantieel deel van haar winst in het “ACA Innovation Lab” zodat er ruimte is om nieuwe ideeën en technologieën af te toetsen.

We hebben bij ACA gekozen voor een proactieve aanpak om innovatie (AI en Machine Learning) bij onze klanten te stimuleren. Dit heeft ons de kans gegeven om samen met onze klanten een aantal nieuwe oplossingen te ontwikkelen door het gebruik van AI en ML.




Waar jij mee aan zal werken (tech & omgeving)

Python & Java
Kubernetes & Kubeflow
AWS / GCP
Jupyter notebooks
Git
Tensorflow
Machine Vision toolkits (YOLO, OpenCV, …)
Wandb
MLFlow




Ben jij de geknipte persoon voor deze rol?

Hard skills

Je hebt minstens 3 jaar relevante ervaring met Machine Learning.
Je hebt ervaring als tech lead in een nieuwe start-up omgeving.
Je hebt een goede kennis van het Engels en/of Nederlands.
Je hebt een goede kennis van software development.
Je flexibel kunnen opstellen in een dynamische werkomgeving. Prioriteiten stellen vormen voor jou dan ook geen probleem.
Ervaring in een test-driven development en Agile omgeving.




Soft skills

Je bezit goede communicatieve vaardigheden.
Je bent een teamplayer, maar je gaat ook graag zelfstandig tewerk.
Je bent proactief ingesteld en gemotiveerd om nieuwe uitdagingen aan te gaan!




Hoe voelt dat, werken bij ACA?

Innovatieve werkomgeving: je werkt met de nieuwste technologie en tools in een omgeving die innovatie uitademt.
Een aantrekkelijk loon, een bedrijfswagen, maaltijdcheques, onkostenvergoeding, MacBook Pro en nog veel meer.
Leren & groeien: bij ACA heeft iedereen een on-the-job coach. Je beschikt over een persoonlijk evolutieplan met een budget voor technische en professionele trainingen en heel wat kansen om bij te leren.
We’ve got your back: we voorzien een uitgebreid gezondheids- en verzekeringsplan om tegemoet te komen aan jouw noden. Het is onze prioriteit om ervoor te zorgen dat onze collega’s gelukkig zijn, o.a. door een goede work-life balans, de juiste tools te voorzien, enzovoort.
Onze unieke bedrijfscultuur: je bent deel van een passioneel en hardwerkend team dat trots is op hun verwezenlijkingen. ACA is een plek waar teamwork, transparantie, kennisdeling en erkenning centraal staan. Trots om ons ""Great Place To Work"" te noemen!
Jij staat centraal: wij zijn gedreven door onze teamleden waarbij iedereen hun steentje bijdraagt, maar waar plaats is voor heel wat fun. Een fantastisch team werkt niet alleen samen, maar maakt ook samen plezier. Daarom organiseren we heel wat activiteiten binnen en buiten onze kantoren en vertrekken we elk jaar op een spetterend ACA-weekend!

ACA’s Innovation Lab is het nieuwe businessconcept van ACA Group. In ons Innovation Lab groeien innovatieve ideeën uit tot gevalideerde businessconcepten.




Hoe wij (samen)werken

Omdat wij een relatief nieuw team zijn, hanteren we geen ‘business-as-usual’ proces. We werken in een dynamische omgeving die eigenlijk vergelijkbaar is met een start-up binnen een groter geheel. ACA investeert een substantieel deel van haar winst in het “ACA Innovation Lab” zodat er ruimte is om nieuwe ideeën en technologieën af te toetsen.

We hebben bij ACA gekozen voor een proactieve aanpak om innovatie (AI en Machine Learning) bij onze klanten te stimuleren. Dit heeft ons de kans gegeven om samen met onze klanten een aantal nieuwe oplossingen te ontwikkelen door het gebruik van AI en ML.




Waar jij mee aan zal werken (tech & omgeving)

Python & Java
Kubernetes & Kubeflow
AWS / GCP
Jupyter notebooks
Git
Tensorflow
Machine Vision toolkits (YOLO, OpenCV, …)
Wandb
MLFlow




Ben jij de geknipte persoon voor deze rol?

Hard skills

Je hebt minstens 3 jaar relevante ervaring met Machine Learning.
Je hebt ervaring als tech lead in een nieuwe start-up omgeving.
Je hebt een goede kennis van het Engels en/of Nederlands.
Je hebt een goede kennis van software development.
Je flexibel kunnen opstellen in een dynamische werkomgeving. Prioriteiten stellen vormen voor jou dan ook geen probleem.
Ervaring in een test-driven development en Agile omgeving.




Soft skills

Je bezit goede communicatieve vaardigheden.
Je bent een teamplayer, maar je gaat ook graag zelfstandig tewerk.
Je bent proactief ingesteld en gemotiveerd om nieuwe uitdagingen aan te gaan!




Hoe voelt dat, werken bij ACA?

Innovatieve werkomgeving: je werkt met de nieuwste technologie en tools in een omgeving die innovatie uitademt.
Een aantrekkelijk loon, een bedrijfswagen, maaltijdcheques, onkostenvergoeding, MacBook Pro en nog veel meer.
Leren & groeien: bij ACA heeft iedereen een on-the-job coach. Je beschikt over een persoonlijk evolutieplan met een budget voor technische en professionele trainingen en heel wat kansen om bij te leren.
We’ve got your back: we voorzien een uitgebreid gezondheids- en verzekeringsplan om tegemoet te komen aan jouw noden. Het is onze prioriteit om ervoor te zorgen dat onze collega’s gelukkig zijn, o.a. door een goede work-life balans, de juiste tools te voorzien, enzovoort.
Onze unieke bedrijfscultuur: je bent deel van een passioneel en hardwerkend team dat trots is op hun verwezenlijkingen. ACA is een plek waar teamwork, transparantie, kennisdeling en erkenning centraal staan. Trots om ons ""Great Place To Work"" te noemen!
Jij staat centraal: wij zijn gedreven door onze teamleden waarbij iedereen hun steentje bijdraagt, maar waar plaats is voor heel wat fun. Een fantastisch team werkt niet alleen samen, maar maakt ook samen plezier. Daarom organiseren we heel wat activiteiten binnen en buiten onze kantoren en vertrekken we elk jaar op een spetterend ACA-weekend!
