Are you proud of your technical skills, commercial head and ability to get shit done? You're reading the right job description. We want someone who is inspired to work in tech for good and is jumping out of bed in the morning because the idea of using their skills to improve the lives of millions of potential customers all over the world, gets them going.

Before we talk about our product and mission, let's be clear that although we're tackling men's sexual problems right now, you don't need to be a guy to apply. We want to hear from candidates of all genders. We believe that if we solve these problems, everyone will benefit.

At Mojo, we're building the first sexually intelligent generation.

Sexual problems can be embarrassing, we've been there. That's why we're changing the narrative around issues in the bedroom.

We believe that good sex starts in your head, so we're not here to push pills or offer quick fixes to the 50% of Millennials and Gen Z who now suffer with psychological issues in the bedroom. Nope, hyper-personalised AI Therapists are created by the world's best sexual wellbeing specialists to help our members lead thriving and healthy relationships 💪. We are looking for someone who is excited to be part of that.

We've had crazy global growth, with over 600,000 members in 150 countries and counting. We're backed by Europe's top VC firms, and you might even have seen us on the front cover of the Sunday Times.

The Role

You'll work closely with the founders, report to our Chief of Staff and take ownership of much of our data stack. You will be given free reign to spearhead new strategic data projects while helping to set data standards in the company. You'll have the opportunity to guide and enable the whole Mojo team across Product, Growth, Marketing and Ops to make good data driven decisions. Most importantly you will be in a position to identify how Mojo can have the biggest impact for our members. We are an app-first experience, meaning this impact will touch people all over the world.

As we are an early-stage start-up, there is room for you to have a huge impact on the future of the company and a large amount of autonomy to shape your role and get stuck in. You should be comfortable adapting your role and responsibilities as the company grows. We expect this might consist of:


Providing analyses to support product, marketing or finance
Owning tracking of business metrics by refining and maintaining reporting
Developing our best practices for experimentation methodology (eg A/B testing)
Developing data-driven projects, including applications of ML or modelling techniques
Working with leaders across Mojo to identify new opportunities in our AI product
Performing analyses to answer open-ended questions and provide strategic advice
Improving business data documentation
Supporting the refinement of our data infrastructure, architecture, and ETL processes
Collaboratively setting standards and ways of working with Data at Mojo
Building a self-serve data culture across the wider Mojo team through upskilling and accessible data tooling


We are building a team of people that have real ownership over the business. To be successful here, you should be willing to roll your sleeves up and get your hands dirty on anything that will help the business be more successful.

Requirements

You have:


2+ years of proven experience analyzing complex data with SQL, Python (& maybe R)
A degree or similar experience in a quantitative field (eg CompSci, Eng, Maths, Stats, Econ)
A good understanding of the dynamics of acquisition, engagement, retention and monetisation in a digital product
Strong understanding of statistical concepts and practical experience applying them (e.g. causal inference, ML, A/B tests)
Experience building data visualizations and dashboards (e.g., looker studio or others)
Ability to work collaboratively and proactively in a fast-paced environment
A commercial head and can put numbers into business perspective
Great communication skills - in person, writing, and code; to technical or non-technical audiences
Compassion, empathy, understanding, or interest in mental health
Ability to keep up-to-date with the latest tools and trends



Benefits


Industry-leading salary £60-70k, with chunky seed round equity package
Private health, optical, audiological, and dental insurance with Vitality Health
Hybrid working, 3 days in and 2 days out, with great offices in Old Street
Three remote working fortnights a year (read more in our handbook)
37 days off (inc 28 holidays, 3 end-of-year, 8 bank holidays, 1 volunteering)
Parental leave for primary and secondary caregivers
Workplace nursery benefit and emergency child-sitting allowance

As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is to maximise business impact within one of many business areas. You will help answer questions like:





Which markets/cities should we enter next?


How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?


What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?


How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?


What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?


How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?


What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?


How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?





The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.




Requirements





A solid grounding in SQL (and preferably Python)


Experience conducting A/B experiments


Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences


A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset


Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems


A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail


A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact


Excellent people skills — you'll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems

We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & BenefitsAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




DiversityAt Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.

At Faculty, we transform organisational performance through safe, impactful and human-centric AI.

With a decade of experience, we provide over 300 global customers with software, bespoke AI consultancy, and Fellows from our award winning Fellowship programme.

Our expert team brings together leaders from across government, academia and global tech giants to solve the biggest challenges in applied AI.

Should you join us, you’ll have the chance to work with, and learn from, some of the brilliant minds who are bringing Frontier AI to the frontlines of the world.

We operate a hybrid way of working, meaning that you'll split your time across client location, Faculty's Old Street office and working from home depending on the needs of the project. For this role, you can expect to be client-side for up-to three days per week at times and working either from home or our Old street office for the rest of your time.

About The Role

You will design, build, and deploy production-grade software, infrastructure, and MLOps systems that leverage machine learning. The work you do will help our customers solve a broad range of high-impact problems in our Defence team - examples of which can be found here.

Because of the potential to work with our clients in the National Security space, you will need to be eligible for Security Clearance, details of which are outlined when you click through to apply.

What You'll Be Doing

You are engineering-focused, with a keen interest and working knowledge of operationalised machine learning. You have a desire to take cutting-edge ML applications into the real world. You will develop new methodologies and champion best practices for managing AI systems deployed at scale, with regard to technical, ethical and practical requirements. You will support both technical, and non-technical stakeholders, to deploy ML to solve real-world problems.

Our Machine Learning Engineerings Are Responsible For The Engineering Aspects Of Our Customer Delivery Projects. As a Machine Learning Engineer, You’ll Be Essential To Helping Us Achieve That Goal By:


Building software and infrastructure that leverages Machine Learning;
Creating reusable, scalable tools to enable better delivery of ML systems
Working with our customers to help understand their needs
Working with data scientists and engineers to develop best practices and new technologies; and
Implementing and developing Faculty’s view on what it means to operationalise ML software.


As a Rapidly Growing Organisation, Roles Are Dynamic And Subject To Change. Your Role Will Evolve Alongside Business Needs, But You Can Expect Your Key Responsibilities To Include:


Working in cross-functional teams of engineers, data scientists, designers and managers to deliver technically sophisticated, high-impact systems.
Working with senior engineers to scope projects and design systems
Providing technical expertise to our customers
Technical Delivery

We Like People Who Combine Expertise And Ambition With Optimism -- Who Are Interested In Changing The World For The Better -- And Have The Drive And Intelligence To Make It Happen. If You’re The Right Candidate For Us, You Probably:


Think scientifically, even if you’re not a scientist - you test assumptions, seek evidence and are always looking for opportunities to improve the way we do things.
Love finding new ways to solve old problems - when it comes to your work and professional development, you don’t believe in ‘good enough’. You always seek new ways to solve old challenges.
Are pragmatic and outcome-focused - you know how to balance the big picture with the little details and know a great idea is useless if it can’t be executed in the real world.


To Succeed In This Role, You’ll Need The Following - These Are Illustrative Requirements And We Don’t Expect All Applicants To Have Experience In Everything (70% Is a Rough Guide):


Understanding of, and experience with the full machine learning lifecycle
Working with Data Scientists to deploy trained machine learning models into production environments
Working with a range of models developed using common frameworks such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
Experience with software engineering best practices and developing applications in Python.
Technical experience of cloud architecture, security, deployment, and open-source tools ideally with one of the 3 major cloud providers (AWS, GPS or Azure)
Demonstrable experience with containers and specifically Docker and Kubernetes
An understanding of the core concepts of probability and statistics and familiarity with common supervised and unsupervised learning techniques
Demonstrable experience of managing/mentoring more junior members of the team
Outstanding verbal and written communication.
Excitement about working in a dynamic role with the autonomy and freedom you need to take ownership of problems and see them through to execution


What We Can Offer You:

The Faculty team is diverse and distinctive, and we all come from different personal, professional and organisational backgrounds. We all have one thing in common: we are driven by a deep intellectual curiosity that powers us forward each day.

Faculty is the professional challenge of a lifetime. You’ll be surrounded by an impressive group of brilliant minds working to achieve our collective goals.

Our consultants, product developers, business development specialists, operations professionals and more all bring something unique to Faculty, and you’ll learn something new from everyone you meet.

At Deliveroo, we have a world-class data and science organisation with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making.




We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. For example, how can we connect restaurants, riders and customers most efficiently in order to deliver food as quickly as possible? How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind?




These are just some of the tough problems we are solving at Deliveroo. There is no challenge that cannot be yours; the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers at Deliveroo belong to an expert, thoughtful, and active community with guest lecturers, a robust technical review process, a career progression framework, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things.




 




The Role 




As an Operational Research Scientist, you will play a crucial role in developing, implementing, and maintaining cutting-edge products that leverage optimization techniques. Your responsibilities will involve engineering sophisticated operational research algorithms, as well as refining and updating existing systems. 




In this team, you will develop the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo’s delivery network. You will work in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. The team has independence and works on some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants. We evaluate the performance of all our decision-making machines through our world-class experimentation platform.




You will report into a ML/OR Manager. This is a hybrid role that will be based in London.




 




You will:





Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real-time delays.


Enhance our simulation capabilities to more accurately predict the effects of algorithmic changes on our delivery network.


Optimise consumer and rider fees.





Also, you will work alongside people who work on:





The consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes.


Detecting fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants.


Assisting restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish.


Creating an ML platform to improve our ML and optimisation capabilities.





 




Requirements:





You are someone who knows the fundamentals of operational research and when they should be applied through a relevant PhD or work experience.


Proven experience in developing and applying optimization models, algorithms, and metaheuristic techniques in a logistics or supply chain context.


You can translate fuzzy logistics and delivery problems or objectives into a well-thought-out algorithmic solution. You get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.


Strong programming skills in one of the languages such as Python, Rust, C, C++, or Java, with a focus on algorithm design rather than software engineering.


Experience in combinatorial optimisation problems.


A bias to simplicity, where you care most about achieving impact.





Nice to haves: 





Experience in solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) and/or building large scale delivery network simulations


Experience in discrete event simulations


Experience in any of the following areas: algorithms and data structures, parallel and distributed computing, high-performance computing 





Why Deliveroo




Our mission is to transform the way you shop and eat, bringing the neighbourhood to your door by connecting consumers, restaurants, shops and riders. We are transforming the way the world eats and shops by making access to food and products more convenient and enjoyable. We give people the opportunity to buy what they want, as they want it, when and where they want it.




We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & Benefits




At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




Diversity




At Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.




We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed.

ABOUT US

We power entrepreneurs with extraordinary financial tools.

5 million of small businesses in the UK generate £1,000 billion of B2B turnover every year. We believe that entrepreneurs are the heroes of the real economy, and they deserve to be well supported.

We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our iwocaPay team

iwocaPay works with sellers to offer innovative Trade Credit and Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) solutions for business customers. Those sellers are essential to our success, as we need them to offer iwocaPay to their customers, who in turn use us to spread the cost of their purchase, for improving cash flow and operational flexibility.

The Company

Fast, flexible finance empowers small businesses to manage their cash flow better and seize opportunities - making their business and the economy stronger as a whole. At iwoca, we do just that. We help businesses get the funds they need, when they need it, often within minutes. We’ve already made several billion in funding available to more than 100,000 businesses since we launched in 2012, and positioned ourselves as a leading Fintech in Europe.

Our mission is to finance one million businesses. We’ll get there by continuing to make our finance ever more relevant and accessible to more businesses by combining cutting-edge technology, data science, and a 5-star customer service.

The function

iwoca's Data Scientists specialise in Supervised Machine Learning, Statistical Inference and Exploratory Statistics, focusing on tabular and time series data. Our work emphasises quantitative predictions through the analysis of conditional probabilities and expectations, using medium-sized datasets.

The team

At iwoca, we’re proud to nurture an entrepreneurial spirit within our teams. This is especially true of iwocaPay, a fast-growing start-up within the business, now with a dedicated team of more than 30 people. With iwocaPay, we’ve created a trade credit solution that has already provided thousands of buyers across the UK with the flexibility to manage cash flow while growing their purchasing power. Our team continues to innovate and expand, driving iwocaPay’s mission to make credit available where it's needed most.

The role

As a Data Scientist within our iwocaPay team, you’ll develop insights for our credit assessment model. Your role will involve evaluating the model, identifying key areas for improvement, and using untapped features to enhance accuracy and reduce friction for customers.

You’ll work collaboratively with Data Scientists across iwoca, sharing expertise with a peer group to deepen your knowledge and apply it to iwocaPay. Additionally, you’ll design and analyse tests and build statistical models to help us reach a broader range of customers.

The Projects

In this role, you'll tackle a few high-impact projects within your first 90 days, designed to drive the evolution of iwocaPay’s risk model and enhance our data capabilities:


Model Evaluation & Improvement: Begin by immersing yourself in our current model to assess its strengths and identify areas for enhancement. You’ll focus on the model’s relevance to iwocaPay and the data sources supporting it.
Data Feature Expansion: Conduct a detailed data assessment to identify new features that could improve model precision and reliability. This includes testing additional data points and exploring off-the-shelf alternatives to sensitive personal data, which add unnecessary friction to the loan application process.
Prototype Testing & Iteration: Start developing and testing initial model iterations, refining as you go. Investigate supplementary data sources, including ecommerce insights, to enrich the model’s accuracy and expand its potential applications within iwocaPay.
Strategic Data Science Influence: Beyond immediate model improvements, you’ll play a pivotal role in shaping iwocaPay’s data science roadmap. By identifying emerging data science techniques and championing best practices, you’ll guide how we apply data science to add deeper value across our offerings, setting the foundation for innovative, scalable solutions that drive future growth.


The Requirements

Essential:


Strong problem-solving skills in probability and statistics, ideally from a quantitative background (e.g., Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, or similar fields).
Proficiency with data manipulation and modelling tools, e.g. pandas, statsmodels, R.
Experience with scientific computing and tooling, e.g. NumPy, SciPy, R, Matlab, Mathematica, BLAS.
Self-starter with ability to work autonomously and efficiently manage projects end-to-end.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to adjust your communication style and technical detail based on the audience.


Bonus:


Experience building machine learning models from scratch (e.g. creating custom optimisers)
Advanced knowledge of stochastic processes and related mathematical techniques.
Experience with Bayesian analysis.
Experience with Python (our primary programming language).
Knowledge of financial concepts (e.g. calculations with deterministic cash flows).


The salary

We expect to pay from £70,000 - £100,000 for this role. But, we’re open-minded, so definitely include your salary goals with your application. We routinely benchmark salaries against market rates, and run quarterly performance and salary reviews.

The culture

At iwoca, we prioritise a culture of learning, growth, and support, and invest in the professional development of our team members. We value thought and skill diversity, and encourage you to explore new areas of interest to help us innovate and improve our products and services.

The offices

We put a lot of effort into making iwoca a brilliant place to work:


Offices in London, Leeds, and Frankfurt with plenty of drinks and snacks
Events and clubs, like bingo, comedy nights, yoga classes, football, etc.


The Benefits


Flexible working.
Medical insurance from Vitality, including discounted gym membership
A private GP service (separate from Vitality) for you, your partner, and your dependents.
25 days’ holiday, an extra day off for your birthday, the option to buy or sell an additional five days of annual leave, and unlimited unpaid leave

We help businesses get the funds they need, when they need it, often within minutes. We’ve already made several billion in funding available to more than 100,000 businesses since we launched in 2012, and positioned ourselves as a leading Fintech in Europe.

Our mission is to finance one million businesses. We’ll get there by continuing to make our finance ever more relevant and accessible to more businesses by combining cutting-edge technology, data science, and a 5-star customer service.

The team

Customer Lifetime Value (CLtV) represents the value each customer brings to iwoca. This concept is central to our business, influencing decisions across every department.

The CLtV team is a small and versatile group of people who manage the CLtV model from the R&D stage all the way to deploying model releases into production. We manage data pipelines that enable the business to use our predictions in their day-to-day decision-making.

Our dynamic and autonomous environment emphasises on ‘getting things done’ and delivering high quality solutions. You can expect working closely with stakeholders, delivering solutions iteratively to incrementally add value, collecting and addressing feedback, and also providing support to the team and wider business.

The role

Your role as a Data Scientist in the CLTV team will involve growing and demonstrating your skills in several key areas, including but not limited to:


Model development.
Explore and integrate innovative modelling methods into our training pipeline to enhance the predictive power and flexibility of our model.
Take responsibility for the full lifecycle of the model, including training, validation, deployment, and performance monitoring.
Clearly communicate and explain any model changes to the business, ensuring transparency and fostering trust in the model's predictions.
Collaborate with Data Scientists and Analysts in other teams to ensure that our model predictions are appropriately utilised and interdependencies are accounted for.
Model-driven insights.
Utilise our modelling and analytics tools (and introduce new ones where appropriate) to uncover insights, such as customer behaviour patterns or the efficacy of new modelling techniques.
Effectively communicate these insights with the broader business to drive value by changing the way iwoca operates.
Project ownership and autonomy.
Independently develop data science solutions to address iwoca's business challenges, with increasing responsibility in solution design.
Maintain strong communications with stakeholders throughout your work to ensure that your solutions are pragmatically solving the business problem at hand and to get technical feedback for personal growth.

The function

iwoca's Data Scientists specialise in Supervised Machine Learning, Statistical Inference and Exploratory Statistics, focusing on tabular and time series data. Our work emphasises quantitative predictions through the analysis of conditional probabilities and expectations, using medium-sized datasets.

The Requirements

Essential:


Ability to effectively communicate with stakeholders and downstream users of the model, and to maintain up-to-date and reliable documentation.
Strong problem-solving skills in probability and statistics.
Experience developing code collaboratively and implementing solutions in a production environment.
Proficiency with data manipulation and modelling tools — e.g., pandas, statsmodels, R.
Experience with scientific computing and tooling — e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Matlab, etc.
Self-driven with the capability to efficiently manage projects end-to-end.
Experience working on research projects, particularly those involving mathematical, statistical, or analytical modelling.


Bonus:


Experience building machine learning models from scratch (e.g., built your own optimiser).
Excellent knowledge of stochastic processes and related mathematical techniques.
Experience with Bayesian analysis.
Experience with Python. (Note: we mostly work in Python.)
Knowledge of financial concepts (e.g. calculations with deterministic cash flows).


The salary

We expect to pay from £70,000 - £90,000 for this role. But, we’re open-minded, so definitely include your salary goals with your application. We routinely benchmark salaries against market rates, and run quarterly performance and salary reviews.

The culture

At iwoca, we prioritise a culture of learning, growth, and support, and invest in the professional development of our team members. We value thought and skill diversity, and encourage you to explore new areas of interest to help us innovate and improve our products and services.

How can we incentivise good rider behaviour?


What is the impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants?


How do we optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?


What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?


How much should our pricing vary by distance and by market?


What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?


How do we adapt our consumer app to better suit grocery shoppers?





The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

We are a technology-driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, looking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.




Workplace & BenefitsAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. Benefits differ by country, but we offer many benefits in areas including healthcare, well-being, parental leave, pensions, and generous annual leave allowances, including time off to support a charitable cause of your choice. Benefits are country-specific, please ask your recruiter for more information.




DiversityAt Deliveroo, we believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing businesses in a rapidly growing industry.




We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of our hiring process. We recognise that some candidates may require adjustments to apply for a position or fairly participate in the interview process. If you require any adjustments, please don't hesitate to let us know. We will make every effort to provide the necessary adjustments to ensure you have an equitable opportunity to succeed.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$140,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$140,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We are home to some of the world's leading experts on autonomous vehicles, creating solutions such as Oxa Driver, equipping vehicles with full self-driving functionality; Oxa MetaDriver, using Generative AI to accelerate and assure the safety of deployments; and Oxa Hub, a set of cloud-based offerings for autonomous fleet management. Our technology is being deployed across the UK and the U.S, and we're partnering with a fast-growing ecosystem of operators, vehicle OEMs and equipment makers serving autonomous transportation globally as it advances.

Based in Oxford, and with offices in Canada and the U.S, Oxa was founded in 2014 and is  growing rapidly (350+ ‘Oxbots' to date). Our purpose is to change the way the Earth moves, through an uncompromising focus on safety, efficiency and explainability of our AI approaches. The company has attracted $225 million from leading investors so far, with $140 million raised in the last Series C funding round in January 2023.

Your Team

Oxa Foundry is a suite of tools that combines generative AI, digital twins and simulation to accelerate machine learning and testing of self-driving technology before and during real-world use.Tools within Oxa Foundry are also unlocking new opportunities to launch innovative solutions for industries such as commercial fleet insurance and risk management. Leveraging Oxa's experience of deploying AVs and establishing capabilities to safely scale (by identifying, quantifying and managing route risk with limited or no pre-existing data), we are helping organisations in those markets augment and generate new data to develop transformative fleet risk management solutions for their own customers.

Your team will ensure the company has enough data of the right kind and the right time from the right sources to sustain rapid improvement across all its tools. It will ensure suitable data ownership across our own fleet and via our customers and partners using data synthesis and expansion, simulation, automatic annotation and logging where appropriate.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you'll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?



Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
Thrive in a collaborative environment



Preferred Qualifications


5+ years of experience in full time software development roles
Experience shipping LLM integrations to user products with high quality
Experience operating in highly ambiguous environments
Knowledge about driving a hypothesis from data



Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$162,300 - C$243,500. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Backed by National Geographic, the Environmental Defense Fund, Canada’s Ocean Supercluster, and many more, we stand at the forefront of AI for ocean conservation & protection. Our software has been deployed by governments, Indigenous nations, scientists, NGOs, and industry around the world. 




What you'll be doing

We’re excited to be pushing the boundaries of what is possible in computer vision: creating grounded visual reasoning & fine-grained classification, and searching for absolutely anything in thousands of hours of video footage. What you’ll be doing is extending our NeurIPS workshop paper across several domains, scaling it to thousands of classes, and bridging the gap between video understanding models and our methods. We’ll provide the dedicated cloud GPUs and research autonomy for you to keep pushing the boundaries of visual reasoning.




You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside our engineering team to bring this applied research into reality, watching as your research turns into real products in just a few weeks. And you’ll get to publish to conferences and journals too.




Impact and scope of work

You will have ownership over mission-critical research, propelling us towards the frontier of ocean tech and our goal of end-to-end visual automation. In this mix of machine learning research and research engineering, you will:

Develop state-of-the-art machine learning models that can reason about visual data and retrieve relevant answers from external knowledge sources. 
Research, implement, and optimize for various tasks, including object detection, species classification, and multi-object tracking for scalable ocean vision systems and environmental monitoring.
Devise better data-driven models for information retrieval, hierarchical classification, multi-modal fusion, generation and media understanding (CV & NLP).
Collaborate with engineers to translate research into products, as well as communicating research plans, progress, results, and impact to the whole organization and in conference/journal papers.
Collaborate and work across teams to develop concepts that advance the entire product pipeline, all the way to production (infrastructure, software, data collection, machine learning, etc.).
Conduct research that enables learning the semantics of data across multiple modalities (images, video, text, physical sensors, and other modalities).




You will also get visibility of the business and product side, and see how OnDeck is commercializing machine learning systems and infrastructure to deliver recurring value to customers and real change to ocean sustainability.




Minimum Qualifications

Ph.D. degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or relevant technical field.
Experience as a machine learning researcher, including internships and full-time.
Proficiency in programming and implementing machine learning workflows using Python (experience with C, C++, and JavaScript/TypeScript is an asset)
Research experience with vision language models/large vision models, multi-modal encoder-decoder design, domain adaptation of open-vocabulary models, information retrieval problems, or other areas related to NLP and CV.
Proven track record of achieving significant results as demonstrated by awards, fellowships, patents, as well as first-authored publications at leading journals or conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, JMLR, AAAI, KDD, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ACL, NAACL, EACL, or similar.
Experience communicating research for public audiences of peers.
Experience manipulating and analyzing complex, large scale, potentially high-dimensionality data from varying sources.
Experience in utilizing theoretical and empirical research to solve problems.
Strong technical communication skills in English, both written and verbal
Enthusiasm for research that revolutionizes visual reasoning and ocean tech




Preferred Qualifications

Previous work experience designing and implementing ML models in production environments
Extensive experience in machine learning products, computer vision-as-a-service, serving ML models, and/or optimizing model performance
Experience in software engineering including cloud/edge development, Unix/Linux environments, distributed and parallel systems, and data engineering
Proficiency with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and multiple machine learning frameworks/tools
Authorized to work in Canada (work permit or other).

As the most trusted global leader in data-first contract lifecycle management (CLM) software, Agiloft helps organizations manage the end-to-end process of proposing, negotiating, signing, and leveraging contracts using our flexible Data-first Agreement Platform (DAP). With contract data as the foundation, customers quickly and collaboratively reach agreement and leverage contract visibility to thrive with competitive advantage. Employing powerful, pragmatic artificial intelligence as a legal force multiplier, and robust integration capabilities as a data liberator, organizations around the world trust Agiloft’s certified implementers to deliver connected, intelligent, and autonomous solutions across the entire contract lifecycle.




Top analysts like Gartner, Forrester, and IDC agree, all showing Agiloft as a leader in the CLM space. Our no code platform is easily managed and administered by business users, which is why Agiloft is the contract you keep: nearly a full 100% of new customers are satisfied with their initial implementations, and some 97% of customers renew every year. Ours is a growing, vibrant, successful company that is at the forefront of a market that is becoming a must-have for all organizations.




We believe that the way to build the strongest, most vibrant place to work is to bring in individuals from all walks of life, and to support them in bringing their authentic selves to their day, every day.

We are home to some of the world's leading experts on autonomous vehicles, creating solutions such as Oxa Driver, equipping vehicles with full self-driving functionality; Oxa MetaDriver, using Generative AI to accelerate and assure the safety of deployments; and Oxa Hub, a set of cloud-based offerings for autonomous fleet management. Our technology is being deployed across the UK and the U.S, and we're partnering with a fast-growing ecosystem of operators, vehicle OEMs and equipment makers serving autonomous transportation globally as it advances.

Based in Oxford, and with offices in Canada and the U.S, Oxa was founded in 2014 and is  growing rapidly (350+ ‘Oxbots' to date). Our purpose is to change the way the Earth moves, through an uncompromising focus on safety, efficiency and explainability of our AI approaches. The company has attracted $225 million from leading investors so far, with $140 million raised in the last Series C funding round in January 2023.

Your Team

Oxa Foundry is a suite of tools that combines generative AI, digital twins and simulation to accelerate machine learning and testing of self-driving technology before and during real-world use.Tools within Oxa Foundry are also unlocking new opportunities to launch innovative solutions for industries such as commercial fleet insurance and risk management. Leveraging Oxa's experience of deploying AVs and establishing capabilities to safely scale (by identifying, quantifying and managing route risk with limited or no pre-existing data), we are helping organisations in those markets augment and generate new data to develop transformative fleet risk management solutions for their own customers.

Your team will ensure the company has enough data of the right kind and the right time from the right sources to sustain rapid improvement across all its tools. It will ensure suitable data ownership across our own fleet and via our customers and partners using data synthesis and expansion, simulation, automatic annotation and logging where appropriate.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$140,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks.

This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$162,300 - C$243,500. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We are home to some of the world's leading experts on autonomous vehicles, creating solutions such as Oxa Driver, equipping vehicles with full self-driving functionality; Oxa MetaDriver, using Generative AI to accelerate and assure the safety of deployments; and Oxa Hub, a set of cloud-based offerings for autonomous fleet management. Our technology is being deployed across the UK and the U.S, and we're partnering with a fast-growing ecosystem of operators, vehicle OEMs and equipment makers serving autonomous transportation globally as it advances.

Based in Oxford, and with offices in Canada and the U.S, Oxa was founded in 2014 and is  growing rapidly (350+ ‘Oxbots' to date). Our purpose is to change the way the Earth moves, through an uncompromising focus on safety, efficiency and explainability of our AI approaches. The company has attracted $225 million from leading investors so far, with $140 million raised in the last Series C funding round in January 2023.

Your Team

Oxa Foundry is a suite of tools that combines generative AI, digital twins and simulation to accelerate machine learning and testing of self-driving technology before and during real-world use.Tools within Oxa Foundry are also unlocking new opportunities to launch innovative solutions for industries such as commercial fleet insurance and risk management. Leveraging Oxa's experience of deploying AVs and establishing capabilities to safely scale (by identifying, quantifying and managing route risk with limited or no pre-existing data), we are helping organisations in those markets augment and generate new data to develop transformative fleet risk management solutions for their own customers.

Your team will ensure the company has enough data of the right kind and the right time from the right sources to sustain rapid improvement across all its tools. It will ensure suitable data ownership across our own fleet and via our customers and partners using data synthesis and expansion, simulation, automatic annotation and logging where appropriate.

About BuildOps:

BuildOps is a fast-paced, high-growth start-up committed to transforming a $300B+ industry through an innovative all-in-one SaaS platform. Leveraging the latest technology, we’re taking Commercial Specialty Contractors from the world of pen and paper to cloud-based, data-driven operations. Our leadership team has deep experience in both the Construction and SaaS technology industries, as well as a resume that includes Stanford, Harvard, Wharton, Cornell, Microsoft, and multiple successful start-up exits.

BuildOps has more than doubled year-over-year while raising over $140 million in total funding (including a recent round in Feb 2024). Top-tier investors like Founders Fund, Siemens, B Capital Group (BCG's venture arm), 01 Advisors, and more have backed BuildOps! Also, Dick Costolo, former CEO of Twitter, just joined our board, adding to an impressive group of investors/advisors including former President of Salesforce, Gavin Patterson; CAA founder Michael Ovitz; NFL legend Joe Montana; former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, and Boost Mobile CEO Stephen Stokols.

Forbes Magazine

“BuildOps is unique because it addresses the problem of efficiency in construction for an often-overlooked audience. Rather than focusing on large projects, or catering to owners, they look to the needs of technician-heavy subcontracting firms working in the commercial space.”

TechCrunch

“The new financing will be used to support the company’s continued growth. BuildOps sells software that integrates scheduling, dispatching, inventory management, contracts, workflow and accounting into a single software package for commercial real estate contractors with staff ranging from a few dozen to several hundred employees.”

Crunchbase

In a statement, [former NFL superstar] Joe Montana noted that his firm (Liquid 2 Ventures) has an investment thesis in supporting America’s working class… “I just love the idea of making their lives far easier and better,” he said. With BuildOps, “you have one solution that does it all and talks seamlessly to every single part of their business from parts to ordering to inventory and more.”

Faire is an online wholesale marketplace built on the belief that the future is local — independent retailers around the globe are doing more revenue than Walmart and Amazon combined, but individually, they are small compared to these massive entities. At Faire, we're using the power of tech, data, and machine learning to connect this thriving community of entrepreneurs across the globe. Picture your favorite boutique in town — we help them discover the best products from around the world to sell in their stores. With the right tools and insights, we believe that we can level the playing field so that small businesses everywhere can compete with these big box and e-commerce giants.

By supporting the growth of independent businesses, Faire is driving positive economic impact in local communities, globally. We’re looking for smart, resourceful and passionate people to join us as we power the shop local movement. If you believe in community, come join ours.

About This Role

Faire leverages the power of machine learning (ML) and data insights to revolutionize the wholesale industry, enabling local retailers to compete against giants like Amazon and big box stores. Our highly skilled team of data scientists and machine learning engineers specialize in developing algorithmic solutions for notification and recommender systems, advertising attribution, and Lifetime Value (LTV) predictions. Our ultimate goal is to empower local retail businesses with the tools they need to succeed.

At Faire, the Data Science team is responsible for creating and maintaining a diverse range of algorithms and models that power our marketplace. We are dedicated to building machine learning models that help our customers thrive.

As a Data Scientist on the Retailer or Brand team, you'll tackle a diverse set of challenges, such as optimizing freight costs, calculating optimal credit limits, personalizing landing pages for new retailers, predicting brand and retailer lifetime value, and improving product listings using AI. You'll collaborate closely with other data scientists, engineers, and product managers to drive projects that unlock value from our unique, rich, and rapidly growing two-sided marketplace data.

Our team already includes experienced Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers from Uber, Airbnb, Square, Facebook, and Pinterest. Faire will soon be known as a top destination for data scientists and machine learning, and you will help take us there!

What You’ll Do

Leverage ML models to improve the retailer Identity Verification (IDV) experience, reducing default losses for new retailers.
Retailer Growth: Build models to automatically generate landing pages and content to target search engine demand. Use natural language processing to understand search engine keyword intent and match to relevant internal content. Build ML models to generate intelligence about retailers to power personalization. Predict retailer lifetime values to optimize retailer acquisition spend.
Brand Growth: Prioritize brand leads for sales by predicting their lifetime value. Estimate the incremental value of new brands based on Faire’s existing selection and brand characteristics. Optimize how new brands are featured and explored.
Listing Quality and Catalog Growth: Use AI techniques to detect and correct image issues, generate product titles and descriptions, extract product attributes, and predict product taxonomy. Perform entity resolution in order to match products across multiple data sources and link product variants.
Marketplace Quality: Summarize and tag retailer reviews using LLMs. Detect and remove products that violate Faire’s policies, such as counterfeits. Use marketplace levers to direct retailers toward brands with higher service quality.


Qualifications

About BuildOps:

BuildOps is a fast-paced, high-growth start-up committed to transforming a $300B+ industry through an innovative all-in-one SaaS platform. Leveraging the latest technology, we’re taking Commercial Specialty Contractors from the world of pen and paper to cloud-based, data-driven operations. Our leadership team has deep experience in both the Construction and SaaS technology industries, as well as a resume that includes Stanford, Harvard, Wharton, Cornell, Microsoft, and multiple successful start-up exits.

BuildOps has more than doubled year-over-year while raising over $140 million in total funding (including a recent round in Feb 2024). Top-tier investors like Founders Fund, Siemens, B Capital Group (BCG's venture arm), 01 Advisors, and more have backed BuildOps! Also, Dick Costolo, former CEO of Twitter, just joined our board, adding to an impressive group of investors/advisors including former President of Salesforce, Gavin Patterson; CAA founder Michael Ovitz; NFL legend Joe Montana; former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, and Boost Mobile CEO Stephen Stokols.

Forbes Magazine

“BuildOps is unique because it addresses the problem of efficiency in construction for an often-overlooked audience. Rather than focusing on large projects, or catering to owners, they look to the needs of technician-heavy subcontracting firms working in the commercial space.”

TechCrunch

“The new financing will be used to support the company’s continued growth. BuildOps sells software that integrates scheduling, dispatching, inventory management, contracts, workflow and accounting into a single software package for commercial real estate contractors with staff ranging from a few dozen to several hundred employees.”

Crunchbase

In a statement, [former NFL superstar] Joe Montana noted that his firm (Liquid 2 Ventures) has an investment thesis in supporting America’s working class… “I just love the idea of making their lives far easier and better,” he said. With BuildOps, “you have one solution that does it all and talks seamlessly to every single part of their business from parts to ordering to inventory and more.”

We’re redefining how humans interact with massive amounts of imagery & video.




What that means

We’re building a near future where people can get information out of imagery at scale without building their own ML models. Collaborating with users around the world, our AI research and products change how people monitor and protect our oceans.




Our core technology: Find Anything & Video Search. We make it possible to find anything in imagery/video, without having seen it in training. Advancing the field of computer vision, pioneered in-house at OnDeck and published at one of the world’s most distinguished AI conferences (NeurIPS). 




Backed by National Geographic, the Environmental Defense Fund, Canada’s Ocean Supercluster, and many more, we stand at the forefront of AI for ocean conservation & protection. Our software has been deployed by governments, Indigenous nations, scientists, NGOs, and industry around the world. 




What you'll be doing

We’re excited to be pushing the boundaries of what is possible in computer vision: creating grounded visual reasoning & fine-grained classification, and searching for absolutely anything in thousands of hours of video footage. What you’ll be doing is extending our NeurIPS workshop paper across several domains, scaling it to thousands of classes, and bridging the gap between video understanding models and our methods. We’ll provide the dedicated cloud GPUs and research autonomy for you to keep pushing the boundaries of visual reasoning.




You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside our engineering team to bring this applied research into reality, watching as your research turns into real products in just a few weeks. And you’ll get to publish to conferences and journals too.




Impact and scope of work

Develop state-of-the-art machine learning models that can reason about visual data and retrieve relevant answers from external knowledge sources. 
Research, implement, and optimize for various tasks, including object detection, species classification, and multi-object tracking for scalable ocean vision systems and environmental monitoring.
Devise better data-driven models for information retrieval, hierarchical classification, multi-modal fusion, generation and media understanding (CV & NLP).
Collaborate with engineers to translate research into products, as well as communicating research plans, progress, results, and impact to the whole organization and in conference/journal papers.
Collaborate and work across teams to develop concepts that advance the entire product pipeline, all the way to production (infrastructure, software, data collection, machine learning, etc.).
Conduct research that enables learning the semantics of data across multiple modalities (images, video, text, physical sensors, and other modalities).




You will also get visibility of the business and product side, and see how OnDeck is commercializing machine learning systems and infrastructure to deliver recurring value to customers and real change to ocean sustainability.




Minimum Qualifications

Ph.D. degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or relevant technical field.
Experience as a machine learning researcher, including internships and full-time.
Proficiency in programming and implementing machine learning workflows using Python (experience with C, C++, and JavaScript/TypeScript is an asset)
Research experience with vision language models/large vision models, multi-modal encoder-decoder design, domain adaptation of open-vocabulary models, information retrieval problems, or other areas related to NLP and CV.
Proven track record of achieving significant results as demonstrated by awards, fellowships, patents, as well as first-authored publications at leading journals or conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, JMLR, AAAI, KDD, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ACL, NAACL, EACL, or similar.
Experience communicating research for public audiences of peers.
Experience manipulating and analyzing complex, large scale, potentially high-dimensionality data from varying sources.
Experience in utilizing theoretical and empirical research to solve problems.
Strong technical communication skills in English, both written and verbal
Enthusiasm for research that revolutionizes visual reasoning and ocean tech




Preferred Qualifications

Previous work experience designing and implementing ML models in production environments
Extensive experience in machine learning products, computer vision-as-a-service, serving ML models, and/or optimizing model performance
Experience in software engineering including cloud/edge development, Unix/Linux environments, distributed and parallel systems, and data engineering
Proficiency with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and multiple machine learning frameworks/tools
Authorized to work in Canada (work permit or other).




Benefits

OnDeck rewards extraordinary work with extraordinary benefits. Get unparalleled career development and exposure with ownership of critical projects. We balance our commitment to excellence with VIP events, hybrid work, travel, and days on the water. We encourage flexible vacation and schedules.




Specific benefits to help everyone work at their best include:

Health benefits: Health spending account that covers any medical expense in your life.
Wellness benefits: Dedicated wellness spending account to cover any additional mental or physical wellness expenses.
Hybrid work, remote flexible: Want to work from a surf beach for a week? Go for it.
