Together with your colleagues you apply state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to solve complex real-world problems. You independently conduct rigorous experiments while also contributing well-designed features to our codebase.

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ data scientists, software developers, biologists, and pathologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take responsibility and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Excellent problem-solving skills and attention to detail (because the devil is in the data).
Strong communication and teamwork abilities (we're a friendly bunch, promise).
Proficiency in both German and English at a professional level (so you can impress us in two languages).

You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.

Gemma was founded in early 2020 by two data enthusiasts. Ever since, we have helped over 70 companies to become more data-driven and successful. We have a fun, honest, and inclusive work environment. We are always looking for data-minded people we can learn from.


Tasks


About the Job




At Gemma Analytics, we help businesses unlock the power of data to drive smarter decisions. As we expand our capabilities in data science, we’re looking for a (Principal) Data Scientist to take the lead in shaping and scaling this new vertical.




This is a unique opportunity for a pragmatic and business-focused data scientist who thrives in delivering real-world impact rather than research-driven models. You’ll work hands-on with machine learning, advanced analytics, and AI-driven solutions—while also collaborating with clients and stakeholders to align data science initiatives with business goals.




Responsibilities:





Build the Data Science vertical: Define and develop the capabilities, processes, and strategies to establish data science as a key service


Lead end-to-end data science projects – From problem identification to deployment and impact measurement, ensuring models are practical, scalable, and aligned with business needs


Develop and deploy machine learning models – Expertise in supervised and unsupervised ML techniques (e.g., regression, classification, clustering) and their application in areas like demand forecasting, churn prediction, and pricing optimization


Act as a trusted advisor, collaborating with clients to understand their challenges and deliver practical, impactful solutions


Stay hands-on with data engineering & analytics – Work with SQL, Python (pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy), and modern cloud data stacks (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) to prepare and process data for modeling


Keep up with emerging trends and tools in data science, leveraging them to improve client results and refine internal processes


Cultivate a collaborative and innovative team culture, mentoring junior team members as the vertical grows



Requirements


You're not just a Data Scientist—you’re a builder, problem-solver, and strategic thinker who knows how to balance technical sophistication with business impact.




Besides that, we are looking for the following:





5+ years of hands-on experience in Data Science, with a proven track record of leading and delivering real-world business-focused ML projects


An entrepreneurial spirit and the ability to work autonomously to build new initiatives


Pragmatism in delivering solutions that balance technical sophistication with business feasibility


Proficiency in Python, SQL, and data science libraries; experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) is a plus


Experience deploying models in production environments that interact with modern data warehouses and cloud-based ML services


Excellent communication skills, with the ability to explain complex concepts to diverse audiences


Optional: Knowledge of data modeling and data engineering concepts to collaborate effectively with technical teams.



Benefits


We are located in Berlin, close to Nordbahnhof. We are currently 19 colleagues and will grow to 22 colleagues this year. Other perks include:





We are a hybrid company that meets in the office twice a week - one common office day and one flexible day


We allow for intra-EU workcations for up to 3 months a year (extra-EU workcations also if this is allowed)


We have an honest, inclusive work environment and want to nurture this environment


We don’t compromise on equipment - a powerful Laptop, extra screens, and all the tools you need to be effective


We will surround you with great people who love to solve (mostly data) riddles


We believe in efficient working hours rather than long working hours - we focus on the output rather than the input


We learn and share during meetups, lunch & learn sessions and are open to further initiatives


We pay a market-friendly salary and we additionally distribute at least 20% of profits to our employees


We are fast-growing and have technology at our core, yet we do not rely on a VC and operate profitably


We have a great yearly offsite event that brings us all together for a full week, enjoying good food, and having a good time (2021: Austria, 2022: Czech Republic, 2023: Germany, 2024: Germany)

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high-quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That's where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Staff Data Scientist at Aignostics, you will play a crucial role in shaping the scientific and technical direction and integrity of our data science platform, projects, and products. You will work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art for digital pathology. Your expertise will be instrumental in driving scientific and technical excellence across all data science teams, ensuring we deliver high-quality, scalable solutions that transform complex biomedical data into actionable insights for cancer research and diagnostics. You will work within the Data Science Staff team.

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ machine learners, software engineers, applied scientists, pathologists, and biologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive, and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup, you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take on significant responsibilities, and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

Data Science or Machine Learning? We do both at Aignostics, and are convinced that both are needed for success. You can expect to work on a broad spectrum of topics from deep learning with foundation and other state-of-the-art models on terabytes of data to projects in low sample regimes and very high-dimensional and multimodal data. We have nearly all the data science challenges you can think of for you!

Your expertise will be instrumental in driving scientific and technical excellence across all data science teams, ensuring we deliver high-quality, scalable solutions that transform complex biomedical data into actionable insights for cancer research and diagnostics. You will work within the Data Science Staff team.<br><br>This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ machine learners, software engineers, applied scientists, pathologists, and biologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive, and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup, you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take on significant responsibilities, and benefit from a dynamic work environment.<br><br>Data Science or Machine Learning? We do both at Aignostics, and are convinced that both are needed for success. You can expect to work on a broad spectrum of topics from deep learning with foundation and other state-of-the-art models on terabytes of data to projects in low sample regimes and very high-dimensional and multimodal data. We have nearly all the data science challenges you can think of for you!<br><br>At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That’s where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer (d/f/m) at Aignostics, you work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art of machine learning for digital pathology. You will develop distributed software systems for machine learning applications that will help to improve cancer research and diagnostics. Together with your colleagues you will take care of the machine learning software stack and thereby enable our teams to build medical grade quality and scalable machine learning models.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Are you proud of your technical skills, commercial head and ability to get shit done? You're reading the right job description. We want someone who is inspired to work in tech for good and is jumping out of bed in the morning because the idea of using their skills to improve the lives of millions of potential customers all over the world, gets them going.

Before we talk about our product and mission, let's be clear that although we're tackling men's sexual problems right now, you don't need to be a guy to apply. We want to hear from candidates of all genders. We believe that if we solve these problems, everyone will benefit.

At Mojo, we're building the first sexually intelligent generation.

Sexual problems can be embarrassing, we've been there. That's why we're changing the narrative around issues in the bedroom.

We believe that good sex starts in your head, so we're not here to push pills or offer quick fixes to the 50% of Millennials and Gen Z who now suffer with psychological issues in the bedroom. Nope, hyper-personalised AI Therapists are created by the world's best sexual wellbeing specialists to help our members lead thriving and healthy relationships 💪. We are looking for someone who is excited to be part of that.

We've had crazy global growth, with over 600,000 members in 150 countries and counting. We're backed by Europe's top VC firms, and you might even have seen us on the front cover of the Sunday Times.

The Role

You'll work closely with the founders, report to our Chief of Staff and take ownership of much of our data stack. You will be given free reign to spearhead new strategic data projects while helping to set data standards in the company. You'll have the opportunity to guide and enable the whole Mojo team across Product, Growth, Marketing and Ops to make good data driven decisions. Most importantly you will be in a position to identify how Mojo can have the biggest impact for our members. We are an app-first experience, meaning this impact will touch people all over the world.

As we are an early-stage start-up, there is room for you to have a huge impact on the future of the company and a large amount of autonomy to shape your role and get stuck in. You should be comfortable adapting your role and responsibilities as the company grows. We expect this might consist of:


Providing analyses to support product, marketing or finance
Owning tracking of business metrics by refining and maintaining reporting
Developing our best practices for experimentation methodology (eg A/B testing)
Developing data-driven projects, including applications of ML or modelling techniques
Working with leaders across Mojo to identify new opportunities in our AI product
Performing analyses to answer open-ended questions and provide strategic advice
Improving business data documentation
Supporting the refinement of our data infrastructure, architecture, and ETL processes
Collaboratively setting standards and ways of working with Data at Mojo
Building a self-serve data culture across the wider Mojo team through upskilling and accessible data tooling


We are building a team of people that have real ownership over the business. To be successful here, you should be willing to roll your sleeves up and get your hands dirty on anything that will help the business be more successful.

Requirements

You have:


2+ years of proven experience analyzing complex data with SQL, Python (& maybe R)
A degree or similar experience in a quantitative field (eg CompSci, Eng, Maths, Stats, Econ)
A good understanding of the dynamics of acquisition, engagement, retention and monetisation in a digital product
Strong understanding of statistical concepts and practical experience applying them (e.g. causal inference, ML, A/B tests)
Experience building data visualizations and dashboards (e.g., looker studio or others)
Ability to work collaboratively and proactively in a fast-paced environment
A commercial head and can put numbers into business perspective
Great communication skills - in person, writing, and code; to technical or non-technical audiences
Compassion, empathy, understanding, or interest in mental health
Ability to keep up-to-date with the latest tools and trends



Benefits


Industry-leading salary £60-70k, with chunky seed round equity package
Private health, optical, audiological, and dental insurance with Vitality Health
Hybrid working, 3 days in and 2 days out, with great offices in Old Street
Three remote working fortnights a year (read more in our handbook)
37 days off (inc 28 holidays, 3 end-of-year, 8 bank holidays, 1 volunteering)
Parental leave for primary and secondary caregivers
Workplace nursery benefit and emergency child-sitting allowance
Monthly team outings
£500 personal wellbeing budget
Unlimited professional development allowance
A £100 budget for noise-cancelling headphone to help with deep work

Apply good management of data sets for training, testing and in-life monitoring of deliverables and promote the value of traceability and governance in model development.
Use best practice to generate recommendations for continual monitoring, revision and improvement of models and other analytical deliverables embedded in business processes and systems.
Support the democratisation of delivered models into support and ownership of wider business teams.


Consultation and Innovation


Stay informed of the latest advancements in data science to identify opportunities for innovation and keep colleagues aware of how these developments can help them.
Demonstrate thought leadership in data science by contributing to team policies and processes that drive consistency and efficiency across the business and minimise misuse and data risk.
Discover and evaluate 3rd party data sets for commercial value and where possible assess potential usage elsewhere in the business.


Active Member of the Data Family


Work with the wider Data Solutions team to design and build data visualisations and reporting to effectively communicate results to stakeholders.
Contribute to prioritisation of work by thinking strategically and communicating regularly with the rest of the Data Solutions team.
Comply with the team’s work tracking tools and process and version control to make sure all finished work is supportable.

What you will get in return:

Our compensation package is designed to attract top talent. In addition to a fair and attractive salary, this role offers a discretionary bonus and a comprehensive range of benefits, including 31 days of annual leave, a non-contributory pension and private medical insurance.

Our Commitment to Inclusion:

Apollo is a growing and diverse team of empowered and passionate experts who focus on bringing innovation, data driven decision making and collaboration to every relationship and every risk. To meet the needs of a demanding global insurance market, we need a diverse workforce that truly understands the international communities we serve.

That is why we're focused on developing diverse talent at every level; inclusion and diversity means more to us than just chasing a target and we are committed to supporting and celebrating difference. Our people are at the heart of our business which is why we value the diversity of thought and talent of every member of our team.

We offer a range of support and run a programme of events and training that recognise the challenges and opportunities relating to diversity.

Hybrid & flexible working:

The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

Full time / Part time

Closing Date: Wednesday 5th March 2025

We currently have an opportunity for a Data Scientist to join our team. This role is open to flexible working, with 21 hours per week a minimum.

The ASA is the UK’s regulator of advertising across all media, including online. Our work includes taking proactive action against misleading, harmful, offensive or otherwise irresponsible ads and acting on complaints. Our Data Science team uses data and machine learning to proactively monitor online advertising and is responsible for our Active Ad Monitoring system, which captures and processes more than 3 million ads each month, allowing us to respond rapidly and effectively to important issues. We are seeking someone with prior professional experience working with complex datasets to join this team.

Reporting to the Head of Data Science, in this role you will work with the ads captured by the ASA’s Active Ad Monitoring system. You will work with images, videos and especially the text of ads from social media, search and web display. You will collaborate with experts across a range of advertising sectors to understand their needs. You will work primarily in Python to perform analysis to extract insight about prevalence of potential issues and help inform priorities. You will also train machine learning models and use LLM-based tools to filter large volumes of ads to find those that are relevant, or that break the rules. You will take end-to-end ownership of projects and will directly see how your work protects people in the UK from harmful and misleading content.

Current projects within the team focus on diverse topics such as ensuring influencer marketing on social media follows advertising rules; monitoring the green claims companies make to consumers; and making sure ads for weight loss medications are responsible. You will report directly to the Head of Data Science, working alongside other Data Scientists and Data Engineers. As part of a developing team, you will have the chance to help shape our approach and ultimately the way data-led insight and machine learning is used to regulate advertising.

Candidates must be able to work with data in Python, and have an understanding of statistical concepts and machine learning. You must be comfortable communicating complex ideas to non-technical people, and you must believe in our mission as a regulator. Candidates should either have prior data science experience, or have done similar work in another setting e.g. academic research in a data-intensive field or as an analyst working with Python. Please note we do not have a sponsorship licence and are unable to sponsor visas.

We think the ASA is a great place to work. We have a culture that’s open, friendly and collaborative, with a real focus on making the right decisions in the right way, and learning while we’re doing it. We’re always looking to improve diversity within our teams, and we’d love to hear from people from diverse backgrounds for this role. We encourage applications from candidates who are likely to be underrepresented in this field of work. We operate a hybrid working model and office attendance is required 40% of your contracted hours.

How to apply: If you’re interested in applying for this role, please review the job description below and complete the online questions telling us how you meet the requirements of the role and how you can contribute to our success.

INDMED

We are the UK’s independent frontline regulator of ads by legitimate businesses and other organisations in all media, including online. We are authoritative and influential on ad regulation; the centre of expertise. The rules we administer and enforce are contained in the UK Advertising Codes, written by the industry Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP). To help maintain our independence from the industry that funds us, we are primarily funded at arm’s length by the Advertising Standards Boards of Finance (Asbof). Together, the ASA, CAP and Asbof make up the ASA system.

Our purpose is to make sure ads are responsible. Our ambition is to make sure every UK ad is a responsible ad. Our values are to be proactive, collaborative, accountable, transparent and decisive. We want external stakeholders to find us to be: independent in administering the Codes; evidence-based, proportionate, targeted and consistent; and reflective of society, not a social engineer.

We are passionate about what we do because responsible ads are good for people, good for society and good for business. They entertain and inform us, helping us to choose products and services. They fund the media, sport and culture we all enjoy. They can be a force for social good, encouraging us to contribute to good causes, make more responsible choices and stay safe. And they help deliver competition and power the economy. By making sure ads are responsible, we protect people from being misled, harmed or offended, helping them feel more confident in the ads they see and hear.

We want external stakeholders to find us to be: independent in administering the Codes; evidence-based, proportionate, targeted and consistent; and reflective of society, not a social engineer.<br><br>We are passionate about what we do because responsible ads are good for people, good for society and good for business. They entertain and inform us, helping us to choose products and services. They fund the media, sport and culture we all enjoy. They can be a force for social good, encouraging us to contribute to good causes, make more responsible choices and stay safe. And they help deliver competition and power the economy. By making sure ads are responsible, we protect people from being misled, harmed or offended, helping them feel more confident in the ads they see and hear.

Being an energetic and enthusiastic member of a team uniquely positioned to bring the power of data to bear on the inner workings of the energy industry
Ability to relate effortlessly with the commercial side of the business, continuously looking for new ways how AI/DS can create value for Vitol

Leading design, development, and deployment of machine learning systems, bringing their technical knowledge and experience into the team, and using this to create real solutions to real problems.
Collaborating with cross-functional technology teams to gather requirements and ensure the solutions align with business objectives
Helping integrate the team’s solutions (including GenAI) into existing systems and platforms to provide seamless user experiences and scale adoption.
Actively participating in code reviews, experiment design and tooling decisions to help drive the team’s velocity and quality
