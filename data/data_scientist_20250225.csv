Together with your colleagues you apply state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to solve complex real-world problems. You independently conduct rigorous experiments while also contributing well-designed features to our codebase.

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ data scientists, software developers, biologists, and pathologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take responsibility and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

About the New Verticals Group

The New Verticals Group is all about expanding Wolt beyond Restaurants and helping deliver anything our Customers want with unprecedented convenience and world-leading customer experience. We want to make Wolt the best place to order what you need, be it groceries, convenience, pharmacy, electronics, home, pet stores, clothing, or other goods. Our vision is to make Wolt the world’s best shopping mall, in your pocket.

We work closely together with cross-functional teams to ensure that we have solid organic and inorganic growth plans, that we execute those perfectly in our country operations, and disseminate best practices across the organization to reduce the growth pains of rapid scaling (it always hurts when you grow >2x per year!)

About The Marketing & Affordability Analytics Team

Our Marketing & Affordability Analytics team uncovers insights on growth opportunities and consumer experience. We partner with Product, Engineering and Business teams to guide measurement and tactical decision-making using advanced analytics as we expand the Wolt platform across the globe.

You’ll collaborate with top Data Science and Analytics Engineering professionals who take ownership of the business outcomes. As we’re looking to grow to the next level of maturity, you’ll play a key role in establishing analytical expertise in various business domains.

About The Role

We’re looking for an awesome Staff Data Scientist in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm. You will be the partner for the New Verticals business and act as the go-getter analytics expert of your domain. You’ll have an opportunity to make a domain-wide impact, by partnering with senior leaders closely and driving the action from the frontlines.

The scope of the role ranges from helping cross-functional teams use various data points to size the potential opportunities, identifying and measuring levers to help move essential metrics, leveraging your technical and analytical skills to tell stories about business performance and make recommendations, and aligning executives around what matters and why.

Our offering to you


The online delivery platform that Wolt is building will offer you interesting and complex challenges together with the opportunities to create a big impact with your skills. Lots of geolocational and temporal data in real-time combined with differences in the economics and dynamics of the cities we operate in make Wolt both a challenging and so interesting company to practice analytics.
You can choose the location from our tech hubs Helsinki, Berlin and Stockholm, or you can work entirely remotely anywhere in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. You have the chance to decide the ways of working — a hybrid, at the office, or remote within the location above. 💙 Read more about our remote setup.
You would get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognize that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement. Read more about how we work.


Our humble expectations


Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.
6+ years of experience in a Data Analytics or Data Science position
Expertise with SQL and statistical analysis using Python, R, or equivalent.
Strong know-how on experimentation techniques (A/B testing, causal inference) and hypothesis testing.
Ability to build intuitive data visualizations and dashboards that influence critical business decisions on senior leadership level, utilizing tools like Looker, Tableau, Mixpanel, or similar.
Clear and concise communication with strong cross-functional partnership experience.
Relentless pursuit of new ideas and data sources, and have the ability to systematically tackle ambiguous problems with a data-driven, hypothesis-based approach independently.
Ability to work and communicate effectively in English.


Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you’ll own a piece of the pie.

For any further questions about the position, you can turn to Product+ Talent Acquisition Partner - Zhanna Filintseva (zhanna.filintseva@wolt.com)

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Working in Product Development at Wolt

At Wolt, we’re about getting things done. You’ll probably enjoy it here if you like taking ownership, developing yourself and being around friendly, humble and ambitious people.

The behind the scenes of Wolt is run by an awesome bunch of over 400+ planners, builders, designers and data crunchers. We call ourselves Product+, as we’re the very core of Wolt’s products, tools and platforms. To build our products, we work in over 40 cross-functional, independent and autonomous teams. Teams are made up of a mix of talented individuals: engineers, designers, data scientists, analysts, and product leads. Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

Join us today to build Wolt together!

Gemma was founded in early 2020 by two data enthusiasts. Ever since, we have helped over 70 companies to become more data-driven and successful. We have a fun, honest, and inclusive work environment. We are always looking for data-minded people we can learn from.


Tasks


About the Job




At Gemma Analytics, we help businesses unlock the power of data to drive smarter decisions. As we expand our capabilities in data science, we’re looking for a (Principal) Data Scientist to take the lead in shaping and scaling this new vertical.




This is a unique opportunity for a pragmatic and business-focused data scientist who thrives in delivering real-world impact rather than research-driven models. You’ll work hands-on with machine learning, advanced analytics, and AI-driven solutions—while also collaborating with clients and stakeholders to align data science initiatives with business goals.




Responsibilities:





Build the Data Science vertical: Define and develop the capabilities, processes, and strategies to establish data science as a key service


Lead end-to-end data science projects – From problem identification to deployment and impact measurement, ensuring models are practical, scalable, and aligned with business needs


Develop and deploy machine learning models – Expertise in supervised and unsupervised ML techniques (e.g., regression, classification, clustering) and their application in areas like demand forecasting, churn prediction, and pricing optimization


Act as a trusted advisor, collaborating with clients to understand their challenges and deliver practical, impactful solutions


Stay hands-on with data engineering & analytics – Work with SQL, Python (pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy), and modern cloud data stacks (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) to prepare and process data for modeling


Keep up with emerging trends and tools in data science, leveraging them to improve client results and refine internal processes


Cultivate a collaborative and innovative team culture, mentoring junior team members as the vertical grows



Requirements


You're not just a Data Scientist—you’re a builder, problem-solver, and strategic thinker who knows how to balance technical sophistication with business impact.




Besides that, we are looking for the following:





5+ years of hands-on experience in Data Science, with a proven track record of leading and delivering real-world business-focused ML projects


An entrepreneurial spirit and the ability to work autonomously to build new initiatives


Pragmatism in delivering solutions that balance technical sophistication with business feasibility


Proficiency in Python, SQL, and data science libraries; experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) is a plus


Experience deploying models in production environments that interact with modern data warehouses and cloud-based ML services


Excellent communication skills, with the ability to explain complex concepts to diverse audiences


Optional: Knowledge of data modeling and data engineering concepts to collaborate effectively with technical teams.



Benefits


We are located in Berlin, close to Nordbahnhof. We are currently 19 colleagues and will grow to 22 colleagues this year. Other perks include:





We are a hybrid company that meets in the office twice a week - one common office day and one flexible day


We allow for intra-EU workcations for up to 3 months a year (extra-EU workcations also if this is allowed)


We have an honest, inclusive work environment and want to nurture this environment


We don’t compromise on equipment - a powerful Laptop, extra screens, and all the tools you need to be effective


We will surround you with great people who love to solve (mostly data) riddles


We believe in efficient working hours rather than long working hours - we focus on the output rather than the input


We learn and share during meetups, lunch & learn sessions and are open to further initiatives


We pay a market-friendly salary and we additionally distribute at least 20% of profits to our employees


We are fast-growing and have technology at our core, yet we do not rely on a VC and operate profitably


We have a great yearly offsite event that brings us all together for a full week, enjoying good food, and having a good time (2021: Austria, 2022: Czech Republic, 2023: Germany, 2024: Germany)

Moreover, using our foundation models you will contribute to developing prototypes for new applications to assist pathologists and generate new insights for improving cancer treatment.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

At Briink, we're helping accelerate the transition to a sustainable future by creating the next-generation of AI powered tools for sustainability advisory, audit, and certification teams.

We believe that AI is the key to unlocking the future of sustainable business. With over 50 enterprise clients—including some of the world's largest firms—we’re already transforming how organizations manage their ESG data. Our technology helps sustainability teams uncover actionable insights from unstructured data sources, making it easier to drive compliance, efficiency, and impact at scale.

Backed by €7 million in capital, including a freshly closed round, and supported by leading venture capital funds, Briink is at the forefront of ESG innovation. We’re based at the heart of Europe’s AI revolution—the AI Campus in Berlin—where we are building a future where AI helps accelerate the transition to a sustainable future.

Your role

As Briink’s AI/LLM Engineer, you will work as part of the product and engineering team to bring the cutting edge of LLMs to sustainable finance and help advance Briink’s mission to use AI to help accelerate transition to a sustainable economy.

Systematically evaluate and improve our core LLM systems: You will use your knowledge and experience as an AI/LLM practitioner to systematically evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM system and help ensure Briink becomes a world leader for ESG domain specific LLM tools.
Build LLMs into production grade services: On a scale with pure researcher on one side and traditional backend software development on the other side, this leans somewhat more on the software engineering side of the scale, as part of your role will also be to help ensure that improvements to the AI/LLM services are driven through to production and delivering tangible value to our users.
Explore new LLM use-cases in ESG: Both LLMs are ESG are moving very fast and so at Briink we value curiosity and exploring AI could be applied to new use cases in ESG. Part of your role therefore will be to explore and prototype new ways LLMs could support our users and solve new problems for ESG teams.
Be a core member of the product and engineering team: Briink is a collaborative team and we really enjoy working together to try and build Briink into a successful company that has mission impact at scale. You will therefore work closely as part of a cross discipline team to make sure all the work we do pushes in the same direction an helps achieve our mission.

At Briink, we're helping accelerate the transition to a sustainable future by creating the next-generation of AI powered tools for sustainability and ESG teams on the frontlines of solving the climate crisis.




We believe that AI is the key to unlocking the future of sustainable business. With over 50 enterprise clients—including some of the world's largest firms—we’re already transforming how organizations manage their ESG data. Our technology helps sustainability teams uncover actionable insights from unstructured data sources, making it easier to drive compliance, efficiency, and impact at scale.




Backed by €7 million in capital, including a freshly closed round, and supported by leading venture capital funds, Briink is at the forefront of ESG innovation. We’re based at the heart of Europe’s AI revolution—the AI Campus in Berlin—where we are building a future where AI helps accelerate the transition to a sustainable future.


Your role


As Briink’s AI/LLM Engineer, you will work as part of the product and engineering team to bring the cutting edge of LLMs to sustainable finance and help advance Briink’s mission to accelerate transition to a sustainable planet. This includes both using your knowledge and experience as an AI practitioner to evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM engine, as well as exploring new use-cases for LLMs in ESG and sustainability.





Systematically evaluate and improve our core LLM systems: You will use your knowledge and experience as an AI/LLM practitioner to systematically evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM system and help ensure Briink becomes a world leader for ESG domain specific LLM tools.


Build LLMs into production grade services: On a scale with pure researcher on one side and traditional backend software development on the other side, this leans somewhat more on the software engineering side of the scale, as part of your role will also be to help ensure that improvements to the AI/LLM services are driven through to production and delivering tangible value to our users.


Explore new LLM use-cases in ESG: Both LLMs and ESG are moving very fast and so at Briink we value curiosity and exploring how AI could be applied to new use cases in ESG. Part of your role therefore will be to explore and prototype new ways LLMs could support our users and solve new problems for ESG teams.


Be a core member of the product and engineering team: Briink is a collaborative team and we really enjoy working together to try and build Briink into a successful company that has mission impact at scale. You will therefore work closely as part of a cross discipline team to make sure all the work we do pushes in the same direction and helps achieve our mission.



Your profile

What type of person we're looking for...



Knowledgable and experienced with building AI/LLM products: You have strong knowledge and experience of thinking through and building AI/LLM systems from prototyping and experiments through to deployment, evaluation, monitoring and improvement in production.


Practical Implementer: You are a ‘builder’ and aim to pragmatically integrate AI into real-world products, moving beyond research to create tangible, impactful solutions.


Personal agency and drive: must have personal agency, drive and ability to figure things out, learn and iterate to drive initiatives forward to success.


Innovative Thinker: You're driven by curiosity and continually experiment with new models, techniques and technologies in the rapidly evolving AI/LLM space.


Excellent Communicator: You have outstanding verbal and written communication skills in English, and can build strong relationships with internal teams and external partners.


Collaborative and Organised: You thrive in a dynamic, fast-paced environment, managing multiple projects while collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams to achieve success. Preferably with experience in start-ups.


Passion for ESG and Sustainability: You are motivated by using your skills to help address climate change and enthusiastic about building tools that help ESG and sustainability teams.



Technical Skills



Minimum of 4 years of experience: As an AI Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, AI/ML Product Engineer or related roles.


Fluency in python: Including strong proficiency with base python as well as modern frameworks (e.g. fastAPI)


Experience with LLMs: Including core concepts around foundation models, prompt engineering and chains etc. as well as preferably some experience with LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain). Experience using LLMs to build RAG systems and/or other real-world use-cases related to document processing would be a major bonus.


Experience with LLM evaluation: Including how to collect labelled data and systematically evaluate RAG and other real world LLM applications, preferably with experience in evaluation tools and frameworks (e.g. Langsmith)


Experience with production grade applications: Including familiarity with software development tools and practices for production applications (e.g git, CI/CD, containerization) and preferably some experience with cloud infrastructure and deployment (e.g. GCP, Modal). Any experience with cost/latency implications of deploying LLMs at scale would be a major bonus.


Fluency in English: With the ability to clearly communicate complex topics to diverse stakeholders. Any other European language would be a bonus.


Understanding or interest in sustainability: Including an interest in sustainability climate, or ESG topics and a desire to use your skills to help accelerate the climate transition.
Even if your experience doesn’t align precisely with all the criteria, we encourage you to apply. Many people miss out on opportunities because they feel they don’t fit every requirement—we believe in growth, not perfection!



What we offer



Competitive Remuneration: As a core member of our team, you will receive a competitive salary and equity package, reflecting your role in shaping Briink’s future.


Purpose-Driven Mission: ESG data has the power to create a more sustainable world, but today it presents more challenges than solutions. We believe AI can change that. Be part of the transition to an AI-powered, sustainable world.


Flexible Working: Our work philosophy is built on flexibility. While we do like to come to the office (in Berlin or London) to collaborate in person, this is a hybrid role with opportunities for some remote work within European time zones.


Trust and Ownership: At Briink, we empower you to own your projects with the option for growing into new roles. We believe in giving people autonomy and trust to drive your own initiatives.


Dynamic Work Environment: Based at the Merantix AI Campus, Berlin’s hub for AI innovation, you’ll work in a diverse, collaborative environment. With frequent events and opportunities for cross-company collaboration, you’ll be part of a thriving ecosystem of AI startups and experts.


Learning budget and quarterly hackathons: We truly believe in the importance of curiosity and experimentation as both a learning opportunity and strategic advantage. We therefore have a learning budget to explore new technologies and regular hackathons to prototype new ideas.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high-quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That's where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Staff Data Scientist at Aignostics, you will play a crucial role in shaping the scientific and technical direction and integrity of our data science platform, projects, and products. You will work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art for digital pathology. Your expertise will be instrumental in driving scientific and technical excellence across all data science teams, ensuring we deliver high-quality, scalable solutions that transform complex biomedical data into actionable insights for cancer research and diagnostics. You will work within the Data Science Staff team.

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ machine learners, software engineers, applied scientists, pathologists, and biologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive, and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup, you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take on significant responsibilities, and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

Data Science or Machine Learning? We do both at Aignostics, and are convinced that both are needed for success. You can expect to work on a broad spectrum of topics from deep learning with foundation and other state-of-the-art models on terabytes of data to projects in low sample regimes and very high-dimensional and multimodal data. We have nearly all the data science challenges you can think of for you!

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Senior Data Scientist at Aignostics, you work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art of machine learning for digital pathology. You translate biomedical challenges into concrete machine learning research roadmaps and coordinate their execution. Together with your colleagues you develop elegant solutions to complex problems, conduct rigorous experiments and finally convince your stakeholders with crystal clear presentations.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That’s where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer (d/f/m) at Aignostics, you work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art of machine learning for digital pathology. You will develop distributed software systems for machine learning applications that will help to improve cancer research and diagnostics. Together with your colleagues you will take care of the machine learning software stack and thereby enable our teams to build medical grade quality and scalable machine learning models.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Experience deploying and optimizing models in production environments.
Familiarity with large-scale data processing and distributed systems? Bonus points.
Bonus #2: Know reinforcement learning or other advanced techniques? We’re impressed.
Soft Skills:
Strong problem-solving and analytical thinking. You see puzzles where others see chaos.
Excellent communication skills. You’ll explain complex tech to non-techies without making their heads explode.
Thrives in a fast-paced environment with multiple priorities. You don’t break a sweat under pressure—because you’re just that good.

Benefits:

Competitive salary and benefits (we pay well so you can focus on the fun stuff).
Career growth opportunities that’ll make your professional life as exciting as your work.
A collaborative, innovative environment that supports and challenges you.
Flexible working hours (work hard, but on your own terms).

Ready to put your Machine Learning/AI expertise to the test in a high-stakes, fast-paced environment? Apply now and let’s make some magic happen.

We are home to some of the world's leading experts on autonomous vehicles, creating solutions such as Oxa Driver, equipping vehicles with full self-driving functionality; Oxa MetaDriver, using Generative AI to accelerate and assure the safety of deployments; and Oxa Hub, a set of cloud-based offerings for autonomous fleet management. Our technology is being deployed across the UK and the U.S, and we're partnering with a fast-growing ecosystem of operators, vehicle OEMs and equipment makers serving autonomous transportation globally as it advances.

Based in Oxford, and with offices in Canada and the U.S, Oxa was founded in 2014 and is  growing rapidly (350+ ‘Oxbots' to date). Our purpose is to change the way the Earth moves, through an uncompromising focus on safety, efficiency and explainability of our AI approaches. The company has attracted $225 million from leading investors so far, with $140 million raised in the last Series C funding round in January 2023.

Your Team

Oxa Foundry is a suite of tools that combines generative AI, digital twins and simulation to accelerate machine learning and testing of self-driving technology before and during real-world use.Tools within Oxa Foundry are also unlocking new opportunities to launch innovative solutions for industries such as commercial fleet insurance and risk management. Leveraging Oxa's experience of deploying AVs and establishing capabilities to safely scale (by identifying, quantifying and managing route risk with limited or no pre-existing data), we are helping organisations in those markets augment and generate new data to develop transformative fleet risk management solutions for their own customers.

Your team will ensure the company has enough data of the right kind and the right time from the right sources to sustain rapid improvement across all its tools. It will ensure suitable data ownership across our own fleet and via our customers and partners using data synthesis and expansion, simulation, automatic annotation and logging where appropriate.

About BuildOps:

BuildOps is a fast-paced, high-growth start-up committed to transforming a $300B+ industry through an innovative all-in-one SaaS platform. Leveraging the latest technology, we’re taking Commercial Specialty Contractors from the world of pen and paper to cloud-based, data-driven operations. Our leadership team has deep experience in both the Construction and SaaS technology industries, as well as a resume that includes Stanford, Harvard, Wharton, Cornell, Microsoft, and multiple successful start-up exits.

BuildOps has more than doubled year-over-year while raising over $140 million in total funding (including a recent round in Feb 2024). Top-tier investors like Founders Fund, Siemens, B Capital Group (BCG's venture arm), 01 Advisors, and more have backed BuildOps! Also, Dick Costolo, former CEO of Twitter, just joined our board, adding to an impressive group of investors/advisors including former President of Salesforce, Gavin Patterson; CAA founder Michael Ovitz; NFL legend Joe Montana; former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, and Boost Mobile CEO Stephen Stokols.

Forbes Magazine

“BuildOps is unique because it addresses the problem of efficiency in construction for an often-overlooked audience. Rather than focusing on large projects, or catering to owners, they look to the needs of technician-heavy subcontracting firms working in the commercial space.”

TechCrunch

“The new financing will be used to support the company’s continued growth. BuildOps sells software that integrates scheduling, dispatching, inventory management, contracts, workflow and accounting into a single software package for commercial real estate contractors with staff ranging from a few dozen to several hundred employees.”

Crunchbase

In a statement, [former NFL superstar] Joe Montana noted that his firm (Liquid 2 Ventures) has an investment thesis in supporting America’s working class… “I just love the idea of making their lives far easier and better,” he said. With BuildOps, “you have one solution that does it all and talks seamlessly to every single part of their business from parts to ordering to inventory and more.”

About BuildOps:

BuildOps is a fast-paced, high-growth start-up committed to transforming a $300B+ industry through an innovative all-in-one SaaS platform. Leveraging the latest technology, we’re taking Commercial Specialty Contractors from the world of pen and paper to cloud-based, data-driven operations. Our leadership team has deep experience in both the Construction and SaaS technology industries, as well as a resume that includes Stanford, Harvard, Wharton, Cornell, Microsoft, and multiple successful start-up exits.

BuildOps has more than doubled year-over-year while raising over $140 million in total funding (including a recent round in Feb 2024). Top-tier investors like Founders Fund, Siemens, B Capital Group (BCG's venture arm), 01 Advisors, and more have backed BuildOps! Also, Dick Costolo, former CEO of Twitter, just joined our board, adding to an impressive group of investors/advisors including former President of Salesforce, Gavin Patterson; CAA founder Michael Ovitz; NFL legend Joe Montana; former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, and Boost Mobile CEO Stephen Stokols.

Forbes Magazine

“BuildOps is unique because it addresses the problem of efficiency in construction for an often-overlooked audience. Rather than focusing on large projects, or catering to owners, they look to the needs of technician-heavy subcontracting firms working in the commercial space.”

TechCrunch

“The new financing will be used to support the company’s continued growth. BuildOps sells software that integrates scheduling, dispatching, inventory management, contracts, workflow and accounting into a single software package for commercial real estate contractors with staff ranging from a few dozen to several hundred employees.”

Crunchbase

In a statement, [former NFL superstar] Joe Montana noted that his firm (Liquid 2 Ventures) has an investment thesis in supporting America’s working class… “I just love the idea of making their lives far easier and better,” he said. With BuildOps, “you have one solution that does it all and talks seamlessly to every single part of their business from parts to ordering to inventory and more.”
