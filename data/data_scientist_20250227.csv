DATA SCIENTIST – GENERATIVE AI SPECIALIST

Entra nel nostro mondo.

Trasforma insieme a noi.

Quale sarà la tua sfida?

Bip ha creato all’interno del proprio Competence Centre “xTech” il più nutrito gruppo di Data Scientist in Italia (fonte: statistiche LinkedIn), e dall’Italia coordina anche i propri gruppi di Data Scientist locali presso le proprie sedi estere.

Nell’ambito della continua crescita ed evoluzione di questo effervescente gruppo, che opera sui nostri clienti in tutti i settori, e ci ha consentito di introdurre l’Intelligenza Artificiale presso le realtà enterprise più importanti d’Italia, siamo alla ricerca sia di profili junior/intermediate (dai neolaureati a profili con almeno 2 anni di esperienza), sia profili middle-senior (dai 3 ai 6 anni di esperienza). La provenienza da società di consulenza direzionale o informatica sarà considerata un forte plus.

Il/La Generative AI Specialist in Bip evolve non solo le proprie competenze nei modelli di Generative AI, ma anche la comprensione dei fenomeni legati al Business dei nostri Clienti e le proprie capacità di tradurli in soluzioni e poi di comunicare e utilizzare i risultati degli stessi per migliorare ed efficientare i processi.

I/Le nostri/e Generative AI Specialists verranno introdotti in contesti progettuali dove per la maggior parte i dati sono non strutturati (testi, immagini, video, suoni) e il cui focus diventa la comprensione, il processamento e la generazione partendo da tali basi documentali altrimenti non processabili con le classiche tecniche di Data Science.

I contesti progettuali spaziano dall’utilizzo di modelli pre-addestrati (es. LLM) fino all’addestramento di nuovi modelli di Generative AI passando dal fine-tuning e absorption learning da modelli commerciali.

Oltre alle progettualità, ai/alle Generative AI Specialist sarà richiesto un contributo attivo per alimentare la Community con attività di ricerca, scouting, concept di nuove soluzioni e business development.

APPLICATION CLOSING DATE: March 28th, 2025

Human Technopole (HT) is an interdisciplinary life science research institute, created and supported by the Italian Government, with the aim of developing innovative strategies to improve human health. HT focuses on 7 main research areas (Computational Biology, Structural Biology, Genomics, Neurogenomics, Health Data Science, Molecular Cell Biology, and Biophysical Modelling and Simulation) organised into 5 Research Centres. The Centres work together to enable interdisciplinary research and to create an open, collaborative environment that will help promote life science research both nationally and internationally.

Human Technopole is seeking to recruit an outstanding scientist to establish an independent research group at HT as Group Leader. The successful candidate should have a proven record of accomplishments in Health Data Science. Candidates with the potential to establish collaborations within and outside the institute will be particularly valued.

The Health Data Science Centre focuses on systematically generating, mobilising, and harvesting “big data” to create a dynamic and agnostic collection of information and deliver a new class of research that will enable a better understanding of the clinical, molecular, behavioural and environmental determinants of non-communicable diseases, for both patient and public benefit.

One of the strategic research priorities across the Centre is Health Data Science, which entails the development and application of cutting-edge health analytics methods that allow the integration and study of complex data arising from electronic health records as well as omics sources. The aim is to optimise knowledge generation from large-scale databases featuring complex and multi-dimensional data and to ensure robust inference and reliable predictions for supporting clinical and policy decisions.

Applications from candidates who are taking interdisciplinary approaches will be especially valued.

HT Research Group Leaders benefit from a competitive core support package that includes funds for staff, access to Facilities and IT equipment, which can further be expanded by raising extramural funding. HT also provides access to a collaborative network within the Italian research community and close links to its scientific and industry partners.

Actively participate in the co-organization and implementation of activities that will promote the image of HT in the international community, such as symposia and workshops;
Contribute to the establishment of a collaborative and open scientific environment by actively participating in meetings and seminar series internal to HT. This will foster synergies between the groups and propagation of knowledge;

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.




To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.




For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.




A few examples of your responsibilities:

Master your toolkit. By working across diverse tech stacks, you’ll refine your ability to choose the right tools for every challenge. From monolithic to microservices architectures, gRPC to REST APIs, Kubernetes to Docker, Python to Rust—you’ll show that true expertise isn’t about using the trendiest technologies, but about understanding their purpose to unleash their full potential.
Build stuff that matters. Regardless of your seniority, you’ll enjoy plenty of autonomy and take full ownership of your work, from ideation to execution. You’ll have the unique opportunity to build software from the ground up and witness firsthand how your code evolves into a product used at scale.
Simplify relentlessly. Is every component essential? Do we need this process? As a Bending Spoons engineer, your mission is to turn complexity into simplicity. Whether optimizing CI/CD pipelines, writing maintainable code, or crafting minimalist architectures, your drive to simplify will power scalable, future-proof solutions.

DATA SCIENTIST – GENERATIVE AI SPECIALIST

Entra nel nostro mondo.

Trasforma insieme a noi.

Quale sarà la tua sfida?

Bip ha creato all’interno del proprio Competence Centre “xTech” il più nutrito gruppo di Data Scientist in Italia (fonte: statistiche LinkedIn), e dall’Italia coordina anche i propri gruppi di Data Scientist locali presso le proprie sedi estere.

Nell’ambito della continua crescita ed evoluzione di questo effervescente gruppo, che opera sui nostri clienti in tutti i settori, e ci ha consentito di introdurre l’Intelligenza Artificiale presso le realtà enterprise più importanti d’Italia, siamo alla ricerca sia di profili junior/intermediate (dai neolaureati a profili con almeno 2 anni di esperienza), sia profili middle-senior (dai 3 ai 6 anni di esperienza). La provenienza da società di consulenza direzionale o informatica sarà considerata un forte plus.

Il/La Generative AI Specialist in Bip evolve non solo le proprie competenze nei modelli di Generative AI, ma anche la comprensione dei fenomeni legati al Business dei nostri Clienti e le proprie capacità di tradurli in soluzioni e poi di comunicare e utilizzare i risultati degli stessi per migliorare ed efficientare i processi.

I/Le nostri/e Generative AI Specialists verranno introdotti in contesti progettuali dove per la maggior parte i dati sono non strutturati (testi, immagini, video, suoni) e il cui focus diventa la comprensione, il processamento e la generazione partendo da tali basi documentali altrimenti non processabili con le classiche tecniche di Data Science.

I contesti progettuali spaziano dall’utilizzo di modelli pre-addestrati (es. LLM) fino all’addestramento di nuovi modelli di Generative AI passando dal fine-tuning e absorption learning da modelli commerciali.

Oltre alle progettualità, ai/alle Generative AI Specialist sarà richiesto un contributo attivo per alimentare la Community con attività di ricerca, scouting, concept di nuove soluzioni e business development.

We will work on your brand together: you will get an opportunity to attend conferences, including as a speaker, and we will help you publish in recognized magazines and online
We will facilitate your access to challenges that are usually difficult to get

Thanks for taking the time to read through one of our open roles. We’re looking for an exceptional Software Engineer (AI/ML) to join our Research & Development team and we hope this could be a match made in heaven.




Who is Peppy?

Our mission is to fix healthcare & wellbeing. We do this by supporting the employees of our global clients, including JP Morgan, Disney, Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft, Sony, Clifford Chance, Wells Fargo, Bloomberg, and over 200 others.




Having already revolutionised the employee benefits sector with our innovative clinical products – such as the world’s first menopause benefit – we are now building the world’s most advanced benefits management platform. Think of us as a “Deel for Benefits” – a rocket-ship opportunity with a mission that truly matters. The global benefits sector encompasses employer-funded pensions, critical illness insurance, private healthcare insurance, and many other categories. This is a trillion-dollar TAM with weak, incumbent competition and almost no AI-first startups stepping up to the challenge.




We are a Series B company with $56m in funding to date, operationally cashflow positive, and with secure access to additional capital for accelerated growth. Join us for the ride of your life.




What will a day in the life of our Software Engineer (AI/ML) look like?

Build AI-first features end-to-end: You’ll contribute to the design, deployment, and iteration of our next-generation benefits platform features that leverage personalization, experimentation, and AI/ML methods (e.g. agents/LLMs, recommender systems, reinforcement learning) to enhance user experience in a meaningful business domain.
Stay versatile across the stack: You’ll work in React (JavaScript/TypeScript) on the frontend and Python on the backend, shipping production-ready code and user-facing features in addition to innovative ML work.
Engage in data pipelines & ML workflows: From data ingestion and feature engineering to model deployment and monitoring, you’ll help shape how we deliver advanced personalization and recommendations to our users.
Keep code clean and well-tested: Maintain clean, efficient, and tested code with clear documentation for both peers and future reference.
Participate in agile, cross-functional teams: Collaborate closely with design, product, and beyond to deliver impactful user and business outcomes, bringing a user-focused perspective to the development process.
Review, refine, and grow: Actively participate in peer reviews, CI/CD processes, and a growth-minded engineering culture, where you continuously seek to level up your technical skills.
Be a team player: Sometimes you’ll be iterating on ML pipelines; other times you’ll be refining a frontend component or fixing a tricky bug. We need someone who’s excited about the full product journey and moving together as one.
Broaden your impact: Gain a deeper understanding of how engineering efforts support various business functions (clinical ops, service delivery, sales, marketing) and seek opportunities to enhance user satisfaction and operational efficiency.




Our dream Software Engineer (AI/ML) will have:

Academic/Applied ML Background: A solid foundation in machine learning—particularly in recommender systems and personalization—gained through an advanced degree (MSc or higher) or equivalent practical experience.
Industry Experience (3+ years): Prior experience contributing to impactful products in fast-paced or startup environments, with an understanding of both scale and quality from larger tech organizations.
Hands-On Full Stack Skills: Proficiency in React/Typescript and Python (RESTful APIs, data pipelines), plus comfort with deploying and maintaining services on modern cloud platforms (GCP preferred, AWS or Azure also fine).
Recommender Systems & Personalization Know-How: Familiarity with data engineering, collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or other ML-driven personalization strategies—and eagerness to deepen this knowledge.
Team-Oriented Mindset: Strong communication skills for explaining complex ideas to technical and non-technical audiences, and a passion for collaborating within cross-functional teams.
A Desire to Ship: Motivation to see your projects—ML or otherwise—get shipped to production and tested with real users, and to continually improve them based on feedback.
Strong Coding Practices & Curiosity: A commitment to writing efficient, scalable, and maintainable code, along with a willingness to learn new technologies, investigate emerging trends, and build quick prototypes.




You may not check all of these boxes, and that’s totally fine! We strongly encourage excited candidates of all backgrounds to apply.

Door machine learning (ML) en artificiële intelligentie (AI) te gebruiken genereer je datagestuurde producten en breng je de meest urgente zakelijke uitdagingen tot een goed einde.

De job in een notendop

Je werkt in het AI Lab binnen een jong, vernieuwend en dynamisch team om transversale AI-projecten end-to-end te realiseren.

Je gebruikt diverse soorten data – interne en externe, gestructureerde en ongestructureerde – om bestaande use cases te verbeteren en nieuwe use cases op te starten. Dat kan voor alle bank- en verzekeringsactiviteiten: marketing, compliance, fraude, procesautomatisering…

Wat je doet, is heel divers:


Je bouwt/verbetert voorspellende modellen met behulp van statistische technieken en machine learning.
Je gebruikt large language models of andere generatieve AI modellen om concrete oplossingen te bieden voor business-noden.
Je maakt, analyseert en interpreteert businesshypotheses en benut datasets.
Je beveelt de business ideeën aan wanneer er data/resultaten beschikbaar zijn aan de hand van visualisaties/voorspellende algoritmes.
Je helpt gebruikers om inzicht te verwerven in de principes van datawetenschap en je licht indien nodig de gedragingen van het model en mogelijke corrigerende acties toe.



Jij hoeft geen witte raaf te zijn

Al kan je er bij ons wel één worden. Bij ons mag je volop je vleugels uitslaan indien je voldoet aan de volgende voorwaarden:


Een master of doctoraat in de wetenschappen met uitstekende academische resultaten op technisch gebied (econometrie, computerwetenschappen, artificiële intelligentie, e.a.).
Deskundigheid op het vlak van machine learning technieken en bereidheid om die kennis up-to-date te houden; een diepgaande kennis van algoritmes zoals Random Forests, Neural Networks en Reinforcement Learning is hierbij een must.
Ervaring met het toepassen van Generative AI modellen zoals large language models.
Sterke programmeervaardigheden in Python en SQL en noties van MLOps & CI/CD.
Uitgebreide kennis van Nederlands of Frans, met passieve kennis van de andere taal, en Engels.
Ervaring in het verklaren van complexe analyses aan een niet-technisch publiek aan de hand van je verhalende competenties en je capaciteit om data te visualiseren; je beschikt over uitmuntende mondelinge en schriftelijke communicatievaardigheden op technisch en businessniveau.
Honger naar kennis, niet alleen om nieuwe algoritmes en technologieën te beheersen, maar ook op interpersoonlijk vlak; je bent je ervan bewust dat de waarde van jouw werk neerkomt op kwaliteit x acceptatie en je wilt sleutelen aan beide aspecten.
Uitzonderlijke probleemoplossende vaardigheden: je weet dat het juiste inzicht in een probleem minstens 90% van de oplossing uitmaakt, je geeft blijk van creativiteit en volharding bij het doorgronden van problemen en het zoeken van oplossingen.



Je scoort extra met:


Tweetaligheid (Nederlands/Frans).
Ervaring met het bouwen van data- en softwareproducten, van ontwerp tot productie.
Eerdere ervaring met Natural Language Processing.
Kennis van Spark en libraries/tools voor visualisatie (zoals Plotly/Dash of React).
Noties van cloud, bij voorkeur Azure.



Belfius koestert zijn talenten

Behalve de kans om elke dag te shinen, bieden wij jou een fulltime contract van onbepaalde duur met:


Een mooi loon aangevuld met een innovatief aanbod om een persoonlijk budget samen te stellen dat je kan besteden volgens je voorkeuren (bv. wagen, fiets, pc, smartphone, tablet, huisvesting onder bepaalde voorwaarden) en extralegale voordelen zoals maaltijdcheques, personeelsvoordeel op eigen producten en diensten, en een hospitalisatie- en groepsverzekering.
Mogelijkheden te over om je te ontwikkelen door een brede waaier aan opleidingen en carrièrekansen in de hele Belfius-groep
Een goede werk-privé balans dankzij flexibele uren, de combinatie kantoor- en thuiswerk en een aantrekkelijk aantal vakantiedagen
Een moderne werkplek in het hart van Brussel met een coole fitness, een lekker gezond restaurant en gezellige ontmoetingsruimtes, dit alles op wandelafstand van de winkelstraat, het treinstation Brussel-Noord en de metrohalte Rogier

Culture and values

We are guided by our shared values. It's not about finding people who think and act in the same way. These values help to guide our work and will continue to strengthen it.

Thoughtful

Thoughtful at Iso is about curiosity, creativity and care. It is about good people doing good, rigorous and future-making science every single day.

Brave

Brave at Iso is about fearlessness, but it’s also about initiative and integrity. The scale of the challenge demands nothing less.

Determined

Determined at Iso is the way we pursue our goal. It’s a confidence in our hypothesis, as well as the urgency and agility needed to deliver on it. Because disease won’t wait, so neither should we.

Together

Together at Iso is about connection, collaboration across fields and catalytic relationships. It’s knowing that transformation is a group project, and remembering that what we’re doing will have a real impact on real people everywhere.

Creating An Inclusive Company

We believe that to be successful we need our teams to reflect and represent the populations we are striving to serve. We’re working to build a supportive and inclusive environment where collaboration is encouraged, learning is shared and every employee feels like they truly belong. We value diversity of experience, knowledge, backgrounds and perspectives, and harness these qualities to create extraordinary impact.

We are committed to equal employment opportunities regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy or related condition (including breastfeeding) or any other basis protected by applicable law. If you have a disability or additional need that requires accommodation, please do not hesitate to let us know.

Hybrid working

It’s hugely important for us to share knowledge and build strong relationships with each other, and we find it easier to do this if we spend time together in person. This is why we follow a hybrid model, and would require you to be able to come into the office 3 days a week (currently Tuesday, Wednesday, and one other day depending on which team you’re in). As an equal opportunities employer, we are committed to building an equal and inclusive team. If you have additional needs that would prevent you from following this hybrid approach, we’d be happy to talk through these if you’re selected for an initial screening call.

Please note that when you submit an application, your data will be processed in line with our privacy policy.

We are looking for a Data Scientist to join Bain’s Advanced Analytics Group (AAG).  As part of AAG, you will work with other members of AAG, Bain Generalist Consultants and our AAG Factory team to build robust data solutions that interact with our Data Science and Machine Learning models to serve our clients needs. We achieve this in two distinct ways:

Working with consulting teams on short-term projects which involve developing software solutions
Developing and maintaining long-lasting products that support internal or clients needs

At Bain, we work with leading companies innovating with data, often involving building digital products.

Many times, in the early stages of experimentation, we have to develop immature digital products as proofs of concept. Those can go from deploying a microservice with a predictive model, to quickly implementing pipelines that integrate client data with the developed products/models.

When any of those tests show potential value, we need to scale them up and help the team capture that unlocked value. Sometimes, this means transforming an immature digital project or product into a stable, usable, and resilient one and bring the most value to our clients.

Because of this, we are searching for innovative and fresh minds that want to join us to create elegant yet practical solutions to deal with the most challenging problems.

Who we are looking for

We are not looking for an expert on a specific domain or analytics framework. Instead, we are seeking people who have strong Data Science experience and feel comfortable moving through different types of data analysis and modeling challenges.

We are looking for individuals with experience building data-driven solutions, training machine learning models and integrating advanced analytics into business processes. Also, people that has worked with diverse data sources across different domains, and who can collaborate with multidisciplinary teams to drive insights and create analytic solutions from data.

While you may already have experience with certain tools or platforms, we encourage you to continually learn and adopt new technologies as you move forward. We want you to see learning as a challenge to embrace, not a chore

What we expect from you:

Enjoy learning new methodologies, tools and technologies
Familiar with statistics, linear algebra, databases and programming
Write code in Python
Skilled at manipulating data, extracting insights and communicating them through visualizations
Experience training machine learning models – both supervised and unsupervised
Comfortable using Git for versioning and collaborating
Strong interpersonal and communication skills to coordinate with both technical and business oriented team members
Have 1 or more years of experience

We are interested in you working with an interdisciplinary team where there are other roles who code and for you to be a reference regarding data science. Also, we need you to feel comfortable at every stage of a project: whether you are putting together a prototype of a crazy idea (that we don’t know what it’s going to evolve into), building production projects or leading the continuous improvement of an ongoing product.

About us

At Bain we say “Champion the bold to achieve the extraordinary”. In the Advanced Analytics Group we deeply embody that statement; we put remarkable data innovators in front of the world's toughest challenges, delivering impact that goes way beyond businesses. By doing that, we aim to challenge the status quo and redefine the domains in which we work.

We are building the most influential data innovation hub in South America. We are looking for creative yet courageous professionals like you to play a key role in helping us pursue this endeavor.

What can you expect from us?

We are people centered and team players: we want to provide an awesome environment to work and grow. An environment where we care about people, our wellbeing and a healthy and vibrant long term development. We believe in a place where autonomy is at the core, and where servant leadership provides direction, guidance and motivation, enabling the best version of each of us so we can build teams based on trust and where we help others shine.

We deliver positive impact and challenge the status quo: we are obsessed with unleashing our clients full potential by developing quick and dirty data products that evolve fast through agile experimentation. We design a vision not conquered yet, and we only seek to make it a reality and bring true impact to the domains we work on. Be it a very complex operational mining process, an NGO’s educational challenge, a retailer’s e-commerce, or a climate change endeavor, we bring state-of-the-art advanced analytics techniques to create new superior realities for our clients.

We are playful and seek for uniqueness: complex problems require thinking out-of-the-box, giving room to challenging ideas and points of view. How we enable that? By nurturing creativity and having fun exploring novel paths and promoting curiosity and learning in empowered teams that take seriously their instincts and passions. We’ve seen over and over again that this never-ending learning philosophy make us better and stronger, broaden our capability range and enlighten our version in the future to tackle challenges that we haven’t seen before.

We’d love if:

You are a curious person.
You are obsessed by learning new things, tackling new problems and being constantly challenged.
You describe yourself as a proactive and creative person.
You don’t feel bad facing failure, instead you learn the reason behind it and learn from it.
You value learning from others, but you also love learning by yourself and teaching yourself new skills.
You value when things are well-written, so you put your best effort on it. Be it code, documentation or an email.
You feel comfortable reading, writing and speaking in English.
You speak Spanish or Portuguese (⭐️ if you dominate both).
You have strong communication skills and feel comfortable working with people that have different roles and seniority levels.
You enjoy working on constantly iterative processes.
You embrace a deep respect for diversity.

We are looking for a Data Scientist to join Bain’s Advanced Analytics Group (AAG).  As part of AAG, you will work with other members of AAG, Bain Generalist Consultants and our AAG Factory team to build robust data solutions that interact with our Data Science and Machine Learning models to serve our clients needs. We achieve this in two distinct ways:

Working with consulting teams on short-term projects which involve developing software solutions
Developing and maintaining long-lasting products that support internal or clients needs

At Bain, we work with leading companies innovating with data, often involving building digital products.

Many times, in the early stages of experimentation, we have to develop immature digital products as proofs of concept. Those can go from deploying a microservice with a predictive model, to quickly implementing pipelines that integrate client data with the developed products/models.

When any of those tests show potential value, we need to scale them up and help the team capture that unlocked value. Sometimes, this means transforming an immature digital project or product into a stable, usable, and resilient one and bring the most value to our clients.

Because of this, we are searching for innovative and fresh minds that want to join us to create elegant yet practical solutions to deal with the most challenging problems.

Who we are looking for

We are not looking for an expert on a specific domain or analytics framework. Instead, we are seeking people who have strong Data Science experience and feel comfortable moving through different types of data analysis and modeling challenges.

We are looking for individuals with experience building data-driven solutions, training machine learning models and integrating advanced analytics into business processes. Also, people that has worked with diverse data sources across different domains, and who can collaborate with multidisciplinary teams to drive insights and create analytic solutions from data.

While you may already have experience with certain tools or platforms, we encourage you to continually learn and adopt new technologies as you move forward. We want you to see learning as a challenge to embrace, not a chore

What we expect from you:

Enjoy learning new methodologies, tools and technologies
Familiar with statistics, linear algebra, databases and programming
Write code in Python
Skilled at manipulating data, extracting insights and communicating them through visualizations
Experience training machine learning models – both supervised and unsupervised
Comfortable using Git for versioning and collaborating
Strong interpersonal and communication skills to coordinate with both technical and business oriented team members
Have 1 or more years of experience

We are interested in you working with an interdisciplinary team where there are other roles who code and for you to be a reference regarding data science. Also, we need you to feel comfortable at every stage of a project: whether you are putting together a prototype of a crazy idea (that we don’t know what it’s going to evolve into), building production projects or leading the continuous improvement of an ongoing product.

About us

At Bain we say “Champion the bold to achieve the extraordinary”. In the Advanced Analytics Group we deeply embody that statement; we put remarkable data innovators in front of the world's toughest challenges, delivering impact that goes way beyond businesses. By doing that, we aim to challenge the status quo and redefine the domains in which we work.

We are building the most influential data innovation hub in South America. We are looking for creative yet courageous professionals like you to play a key role in helping us pursue this endeavor.

What can you expect from us?

We are people centered and team players: we want to provide an awesome environment to work and grow. An environment where we care about people, our wellbeing and a healthy and vibrant long term development. We believe in a place where autonomy is at the core, and where servant leadership provides direction, guidance and motivation, enabling the best version of each of us so we can build teams based on trust and where we help others shine.

We deliver positive impact and challenge the status quo: we are obsessed with unleashing our clients full potential by developing quick and dirty data products that evolve fast through agile experimentation. We design a vision not conquered yet, and we only seek to make it a reality and bring true impact to the domains we work on. Be it a very complex operational mining process, an NGO’s educational challenge, a retailer’s e-commerce, or a climate change endeavor, we bring state-of-the-art advanced analytics techniques to create new superior realities for our clients.

We are playful and seek for uniqueness: complex problems require thinking out-of-the-box, giving room to challenging ideas and points of view. How we enable that? By nurturing creativity and having fun exploring novel paths and promoting curiosity and learning in empowered teams that take seriously their instincts and passions. We’ve seen over and over again that this never-ending learning philosophy make us better and stronger, broaden our capability range and enlighten our version in the future to tackle challenges that we haven’t seen before.

We’d love if:

You are a curious person.
You are obsessed by learning new things, tackling new problems and being constantly challenged.
You describe yourself as a proactive and creative person.
You don’t feel bad facing failure, instead you learn the reason behind it and learn from it.
You value learning from others, but you also love learning by yourself and teaching yourself new skills.
You value when things are well-written, so you put your best effort on it. Be it code, documentation or an email.
You feel comfortable reading, writing and speaking in English.
You speak Spanish or Portuguese (⭐️ if you dominate both).
You have strong communication skills and feel comfortable working with people that have different roles and seniority levels.
You enjoy working on constantly iterative processes.
You embrace a deep respect for diversity.

Sometimes, this means transforming an immature digital project or product into a stable, usable, and resilient one and bring the most value to our clients.</span></p><p><span>Because of this, we are searching for innovative and fresh minds that want to join us to create elegant yet practical solutions to deal with the most challenging problems.</span></p><p><strong><span>Who we are looking for</span></strong></p><p><span>We are not looking for an expert on a specific domain or analytics framework. Instead, we are seeking people who have strong Data Science experience and feel comfortable moving through different types of data analysis and modeling challenges.</span></p><p><span>We are looking for individuals with experience building data-driven solutions, training machine learning models and integrating advanced analytics into business processes. Also, people that has worked with diverse data sources across different domains, and who can collaborate with multidisciplinary teams to drive insights and create analytic solutions from data.</span></p><p><span>While you may already have experience with certain tools or platforms, we encourage you to continually learn and adopt new technologies as you move forward. We want you to see learning as a challenge to embrace, not a chore</span></p><p><span>What we expect from you:</span></p><ul><li><span>Enjoy learning new methodologies, tools and technologies</span></li><li><span>Familiar with statistics, linear algebra, databases and programming</span></li><li><span>Write code in Python</span></li><li><span>Skilled at manipulating data, extracting insights and communicating them through visualizations</span></li><li><span>Experience training machine learning models – both supervised and unsupervised</span></li><li><span>Comfortable using Git for versioning and collaborating</span></li><li><span>Strong interpersonal and communication skills to coordinate with both technical and business oriented team members</span></li><li><span>Have 1 or more years of experience</span></li></ul><p><span>We are interested in you working with an interdisciplinary team where there are other roles who code and for you to be a reference regarding data science. Also, we need you to feel comfortable at every stage of a project: whether you are putting together a prototype of a crazy idea (that we don’t know what it’s going to evolve into), building production projects or leading the continuous improvement of an ongoing product.</span></p><p><strong><span>About us</span></strong></p><p><span>At Bain we say “Champion the bold to achieve the extraordinary”. In the Advanced Analytics Group we deeply embody that statement; we put remarkable data innovators in front of the world's toughest challenges, delivering impact that goes way beyond businesses. By doing that, we aim to challenge the status quo and redefine the domains in which we work.</span></p><p><span>We are building the most influential data innovation hub in South America. We are looking for creative yet courageous professionals like you to play a key role in helping us pursue this endeavor.</span></p><p><strong><span>What can you expect from us?</span></strong></p><p><span>We are people centered and team players: we want to provide an awesome environment to work and grow. An environment where we care about people, our wellbeing and a healthy and vibrant long term development. We believe in a place where autonomy is at the core, and where servant leadership provides direction, guidance and motivation, enabling the best version of each of us so we can build teams based on trust and where we help others shine.</span></p><p><span>We deliver positive impact and challenge the status quo: we are obsessed with unleashing our clients full potential by developing quick and dirty data products that evolve fast through agile experimentation. We design a vision not conquered yet, and we only seek to make it a reality and bring true impact to the domains we work on. Be it a very complex operational mining process, an NGO’s educational challenge, a retailer’s e-commerce, or a climate change endeavor, we bring state-of-the-art advanced analytics techniques to create new superior realities for our clients.</span></p><p><span>We are playful and seek for uniqueness: complex problems require thinking out-of-the-box, giving room to challenging ideas and points of view. How we enable that? By nurturing creativity and having fun exploring novel paths and promoting curiosity and learning in empowered teams that take seriously their instincts and passions. We’ve seen over and over again that this never-ending learning philosophy make us better and stronger, broaden our capability range and enlighten our version in the future to tackle challenges that we haven’t seen before.</span></p><p><span>We’d love if:</span></p><ul><li><span>You are a curious person.</span></li><li><span>You are obsessed by learning new things, tackling new problems and being constantly challenged.</span></li><li><span>You describe yourself as a proactive and creative person.</span></li><li><span>You don’t feel bad facing failure, instead you learn the reason behind it and learn from it.</span></li><li><span>You value learning from others, but you also love learning by yourself and teaching yourself new skills.</span></li><li><span>You value when things are well-written, so you put your best effort on it.&nbsp;</span><span>Be it code, documentation or an email.</span></li><li><span>You feel comfortable reading, writing and speaking in English.</span></li><li><span>You speak Spanish or Portuguese (</span><span>⭐️</span><span>&nbsp;if you dominate both).</span></li><li><span>You have strong communication skills and feel comfortable working with people that have different roles and seniority levels.</span></li><li><span>You enjoy working on constantly iterative processes.</span></li><li><span>You embrace a deep respect for diversity.</span></li></ul>
