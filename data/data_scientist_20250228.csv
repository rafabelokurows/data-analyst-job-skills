Code is a high-end e-commerce agency with Shopify at its core. Being a Coder means you are at the forefront of designing, developing and optimizing online stores for ambitious brands like Stoov, Intersport, Alpinestars, BOSKA, Mercer Amsterdam and Rosefield.




We're a team of 55 developers, project- and customer success managers, e-commerce consultants and marketers with a shared passion: e-commerce. We are spread out across our three offices in Delft, Amsterdam and Berlin. With 16 different nationalities and over 40% women, we are a diverse team.




But enough about us - we want to know more about you!




About the role

As a Medior Frontend Developer at Code, you build high-performance, user-friendly, and visually stunning Shopify webshops. You seamlessly translate designs into pixel-perfect storefronts and develop custom solutions that make an impact. You do this using Liquid, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript (ES6+).




Working closely with designers, backend developers, and project managers, you bring our clients’ technical visions to life. Whether it’s improving load times, adding innovative features, or optimizing the user experience, you know exactly how to leverage technology to take e-commerce to the next level.




Every day brings new technical challenges, such as:

How do we optimize this webshop for maximum speed and conversion?
How do we build a flexible component library that scales across multiple clients?
How do we enhance the user experience with interactive elements?




At Code, you get the chance to make a real impact. You’ll work on unique projects, like a 3D/AR product viewer for BURNHARD or a racesuit configurator for Alpinestars. No standard templates, just tailor-made solutions that push Shopify to its limits.




About you

As a Medior Frontend Developer at Code, you know that a great webshop is more than just code. You don’t just build something that works, you create something that stands out in performance, design, and user experience. And you don’t do it alone. For you, clear communication and teamwork are just as important as clean code.




This is you:

Technically communicative: You can clearly explain technical decisions, ensuring both colleagues and clients understand why things work the way they do.
Collaborative: You work seamlessly with designers, backend developers, and project managers, offering help where needed and staying open to new insights.
Problem-solving mindset: You think in solutions, not obstacles. From browser bugs to performance optimizations, you fix it.
Pixel-perfect mindset: You have a keen eye for detail, ensuring that every webshop is not just functional but also looks sharp and runs smoothly.
Strong time management: You keep an overview and set priorities, allowing you to juggle multiple projects effortlessly without compromising on quality.




You have:

Experience with Liquid, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript (ES6+).
Ability to apply best practices in modular web development.
Proficiency in Git and Git Flow.
Experience in interpreting and working with third-party libraries and APIs.
Knowledge of best web performance and SEO practices.
Experience working in an agile environment, including Scrum.
Strong command of the English language, both written and spoken.




Bonus points if you:

Have experience with Shopify, Magento, or another e-commerce platform.
Work with Gulp or Webpack.
Are familiar with design tools like InVision, Sketch, Adobe, or Figma.




What's in it for you:

You will work on fun, visible and challenging projects for growing brands in the Champions League of e-commerce.
Flexible location: possibility to work in our beautiful office in picturesque Delft, vibrant Amsterdam or remote - we meet up weekly during dev-days in the office in Delft, easy accessibility by public transport.
You will join an agency with high ambitions but realistic expectations. We actively facilitate a healthy work-life balance.
Your personal and professional development is essential to us: together we invest in your growth.
Informal dress code and open culture – we like to feel at home! So expect to have fun with after-work drinks & team outings.
Being part of a team where your input will be valued and respected.
When we're out of office, we really are.
A mobility budget, giving you the freedom to choose how you prefer to travel.
A MacBook.
Tasty lunches provided at the office every day. You’ll be amazed by the lovely rendang that our Tsong-Fu prepares every month (veggie options as well!). Our fridge is fully stocked with beer and soda, so don’t worry about that.




Do you not fully meet all the requested job requirements or experience? But do you get extremely excited about this role and Code? Then we encourage you to apply anyway.

Technology is at our core. And innovation is everywhere. But our company is more than datasets, lines of code or A/B tests. We’re the thrill of the first night in a new place. The excitement of the next morning. The friends you encounter. The journeys you take. The sights you see. And the memories you make. Through our products, partners and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.

Leadership/Team Quote:

The Content Intelligence team builds the Content Intelligence Platform by consuming millions of images and textual inputs every day, and then enriching it with ML capabilities. Eventually, these will serve downstream applications and personalize our customers' experience (think of a way to choose and surface the right images and reviews when customers book their next vacation).

Moreover the team is taking a key role in the new GenAI project - The AI Trip Planner.

Role Description:

As a machine learning scientist, your work will focus on building, training and deploying content models (Computer vision, NLP and Generative AI) using the most advanced technologies and models.

You will be responsible for identifying and proposing the most appropriate data sources and modeling techniques to solve complex problems and drive business value.

Key Job Responsibilities and Duties:


Explore and apply state-of-the-art techniques in multimodal machine learning.
Train innovative ML models (NLP, CV, LLM-finetuning…), build algorithms, and engineering approaches to drive business impact..

Whether it’s , a , or , we encounter exceptional objects every day.




We're a one-of-a-kind marketplace for buying and selling special objects! Each week we offer over 75,000 unique items in auction, carefully curated by our passionate in-house experts.




Having sold over 20 million unique objects to date, we’re on a mission to become the world’s most popular destination for special objects. As a growing, diverse and sustainable scale-up, we proudly live by our core values:





Taking ownership and driving impact


Being open to change and feedback


Being passionate about our mission and our customers.





If these values resonate with you, we’d love to explore how you can join us on this exciting journey!


About the role and team


With thousands of active lots every day, hundreds of thousands of daily bids, millions of users, and billions of events, the Catawiki platform generates vast amounts of data every day. All this data is being collected and stored, and used extensively by our team of 19 data scientists and engineers that want to build a better company by using data in a smart way. At Catawiki, we believe in using data for making decisions, and the Data Science & Analytics team plays a central role in that.




We are looking for a Data Scientist - Marketing Insights to work with our Marketing team and leverage data to measure success of our marketing strategies and campaigns to find opportunities to attract more people on Catawiki.




You will be part of the Data Science Commercial Insights Team helping us make sense of our data, finding actionable insights and creating self-service opportunities by combining data from multiple sources and working closely together with your colleagues in other departments.


What You'll Do



You will collaborate with cross-functional Marketing teams, and will own analytics for an entire team or multiple (Paid-search, CRM, Brand etc), developing strong relationships with your stakeholders and proactively identifying growth opportunities through your deep understanding of Catawiki’s trends.


On a daily basis, you will be on top of all of Catawiki’s data, and you will work with Marketing to develop or identify metrics that measure the business impact of Marketing initiatives.


To drive data-informed decisions, you will leverage advanced analytics techniques such as regression analysis, causal inference, and experimentation (e.g., A/B testing) to understand user behaviour, identify actionable insights, and evaluate the effectiveness of new features.


You will identify and implement data self-service opportunities to enable Marketing teams to make decisions at scale.


You will be part of the Data team where you will also get an opportunity to work on multiple foundational data topics, such as building scalable data pipelines, improving data accessibility across the company or enabling new tracking frameworks (server-side tagging etc).



Who You Are



A Data Scientist / Business Analyst / Data Analytics Engineer with a strong quantitative background and at least 3 years of relevant experience (ideally in an online company)


You are not afraid of handling large volumes of data and are able to maintain complex data pipelines


You are an SQL Ninja


Fluent in either R or Python


You are also skilled in data visualisation tools (Looker Studio, Tableau, Power BI etc)


You have experience with Web and App analytics and tracking tools (GA/GTM)


Proven ability to extract meaning from large datasets with little engineering support


Experience with A/B experimentation and data transformation tools (dbt, Dataform etc) is a plus


With examples from your own experience you can demonstrate a strong focus on deriving actionable business insights from your analyses


You have strong communication skills and are able to work at a fast pace with business owners, engineers and management


An entrepreneurial mindset that enables you to get things done, also if that requires actions outside your own area or comfort zone



Where You’ll Be


This role is based in our Amsterdam office, in the Netherlands.


Why You'll Love Working with Us



Create a Visible Impact by working at scale in a global organisation that serves millions of customers across 80+ categories. In our flat structure, every role has a broad scope that directly impacts both our customers and the business.


Learn and Grow with Us through our Learning & Development initiatives, which include clear development plans and mentorship programmes designed to support your career progression.


A Culture of Connection defines us. We’re a passionate, diverse and collaborative team of 800+ Catawikains and 60+ nationalities, all coming together to build a one-of-a-kind marketplace. We foster an inclusive and queer-friendly work environment, committed to making every Catawikian feel welcomed and empowered. Whatever your story, we encourage you to bring your unique perspective to our team.


Celebrate Life’s Moments with us at Catawiki. When you join us, you’ll receive a €100 Catavoucher, and on each birthday, you'll get a €50 Catavoucher to celebrate. Enjoy an extra day off each year to ""Pursue Your Passion"". We also recognise significant work anniversaries (3, 5, 8, 10 years) with additional time off, plus extra leave for life’s big moments like marriage, engagements, or moving house.





Please note that benefits can vary by location. For specific information regarding what’s available in your country, please consult your recruiter.


Our Offices and Way of Working


Our vibrant offices in Amsterdam, Paris and Lisbon are designed to inspire and connect. Most Catawikians are within commuting distance of one of our offices and enjoy the flexibility of a hybrid work model. This means we typically ask you to be in the office 2 out of 5 days, roughly 40% of your working time, to collaborate and connect with your colleagues. Of course, if the job description specifies that the role is 100% remote—such as for certain expert or sales positions—then that arrangement will apply.

Waar de Data Analist zich richt op de inzichten die uit data gehaald kunnen worden en de Data Engineer zich focust op het technische aspect van het ophalen, structureren en integreren van de data, maakt de Data Scientist berekeningen op basis van de data om voorspellingen te kunnen doen over toekomstige ontwikkelingen in de branche of organisatie. Als Data Scientist ben je dan ook een vaardig programmeur. Daarnaast houdt een Data Scientist zich bezig met het bouwen, voorspellen en evalueren van algoritmes en beperkt hij zich niet tot het heden en verleden, maar kijkt ook naar de toekomst middels voorspellende modellen.

Wij starten ieder kwartaal een Data Science Traineeship waarin jij door specialisten met ervaring uit de praktijk opgeleid wordt tot een Data Engineer of Data Scientist.

De eerste drie maanden word je fulltime opgeleid (theorie, examens en praktijk) door professionals uit het data vakgebied. Na de opleidingsperiode begeleiden wij je richting een passende opdrachtgever in de regio van jouw woonplaats. Hiervoor ga je in gesprek met opdrachtgevers waarvoor wij je uiteraard goed voorbereiden. Je kiest uiteindelijk zelf waar je wil gaan starten. Denk hierbij aan MKB bedrijven, gemeentelijke-, zorg- en onderwijs organisaties of top 500 bedrijven als Rabobank, TNO, VDL, Alliander, ONVZ, ASR, NOC*NSF, Van Lanschot, Achmea of Gazelle. Na ruim één jaar via People X te hebben gewerkt, treed je in dienst bij de opdrachtgever en maak je weer een stap in salaris.

Functieomschrijving

Je werkzaamheden zijn uiteenlopend en inhoudelijk verschillend per opdrachtgever/branche waar je gaat werken, maar denk hierbij aan:

1

Opschonen en verwerken van ruwe data tot bruikbare data;

2

Het opzetten en inrichten van een datawarehouse;

3

Op basis van je bevindingen advies geven over de huidige en toekomstige bedrijfsvoering;

4

Herkennen van patronen in grote hoeveelheden data, om hiervoor een voorspellend algoritme te ontwikkelen (machine learning);

5

Beschrijven en visualiseren van ontdekte inzichten en voorspellingen.

Wat heeft People X jou te bieden?

1

Een traineeship van 1,5 jaar;

2

Je wordt betaald vanaf dag 1 van het traineeship en ontvangt vanaf je inzet bij een opdrachtgever tussen de € 2750,- en € 3250,- bruto per maand o.b.v. 40 uur;

3

Een specialistisch data traineeship gedoceerd door erkende (Microsoft) gecertificeerde trainers;

4

Het behalen van diverse erkende certificeringen die aansluiten op de behoefte in de markt: SQL, Power BI, Azure, Fabric, Data Science en Scrum / Agile;

5

Het behalen van vier officiële Microsoft Certified titels: Azure Fundamentals, Data Analyst Associate, Fabric Data Engineer Associate en Azure Data Scientist Associate;

6

Soft-, Business- en Vitaliteitstrainingen zodat je vanaf het begin stevig in je schoenen staat;

7

Begeleiding en coaching vanuit een persoonlijke Talent Manager die zorgt voor een goede instroom en ontwikkeling bij de opdrachtgever waar je gaat starten;

8

Baangarantie bij een toporganisatie in een branche die bij je past en uiteraard in de regio van je woonplaats;

9

Een gedegen inwerktraject door een ervaren Data specialist en een groot kennisnetwerk van (oud) trainees, trainers en specialisten waar jij op terug kunt vallen en mee kan sparren;

10

Tijdens en na het traineeship ontvang je een kilometervergoeding (€ 0,23) of een NS Businesscard;

11

Een uitgebreide pensioenregeling.

Wat vragen wij?

1

Een (bijna) afgeronde universitaire master in bijvoorbeeld Econometrie, Operations Research, Wiskunde, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science of een andere relevante technische/statistische studie;

2

Je beheerst minimaal één programmeertaal vanuit jouw studie of zelfstudie (bijvoorbeeld Python, R, Matlab of Java);

3

Ervaring met statistiek vanuit jouw studie of zelfstudie (bijvoorbeeld met SPSS, Stata etc.).

4

Daarnaast is ervaring met SQL en/of Machine Learning / Deep Learning technieken een pré;

5

Je bent leergierig, analytisch, oplossingsgericht, zelfstandig en hebt de drive om je kennis up-to-date te houden;

Waar de Data Analist zich richt op de inzichten die uit data gehaald kunnen worden en de Data Engineer zich focust op het technische aspect van het ophalen, structureren en integreren van de data, maakt de Data Scientist berekeningen op basis van de data om voorspellingen te kunnen doen over toekomstige ontwikkelingen in de branche of organisatie. Als Data Scientist ben je dan ook een vaardig programmeur. Daarnaast houdt een Data Scientist zich bezig met het bouwen, voorspellen en evalueren van algoritmes en beperkt hij zich niet tot het heden en verleden, maar kijkt ook naar de toekomst middels voorspellende modellen.

Wij starten ieder kwartaal een Data Science Traineeship waarin jij door specialisten met ervaring uit de praktijk opgeleid wordt tot een Data Engineer of Data Scientist.

De eerste drie maanden word je fulltime opgeleid (theorie, examens en praktijk) door professionals uit het data vakgebied. Na de opleidingsperiode begeleiden wij je richting een passende opdrachtgever in de regio van jouw woonplaats. Hiervoor ga je in gesprek met opdrachtgevers waarvoor wij je uiteraard goed voorbereiden. Je kiest uiteindelijk zelf waar je wil gaan starten. Denk hierbij aan MKB bedrijven, gemeentelijke-, zorg- en onderwijs organisaties of top 500 bedrijven als Rabobank, TNO, VDL, Alliander, ONVZ, ASR, NOC*NSF, Van Lanschot, Achmea of Gazelle. Na ruim één jaar via People X te hebben gewerkt, treed je in dienst bij de opdrachtgever en maak je weer een stap in salaris.

The following would be an advantage:




Experience with the development and implementation of Machine Learning systems.
Proficiency in spoken and/or written German.
Experience with photonic devices and/or quantum photonic computation.




What to expect from us:




Working in a start-up means that your work contributes directly to the direction of the company. Together, we work on awesome and challenging projects in a high-tech and innovative environment. Everyone has their own specialty and together we form a dynamic and diverse team.

Your workplace will be in Stuttgart, Germany. The working language of our company is English. As a Dutch-German start-up we have flat hierarchies and a collaborative and inclusive work environment. We provide the resources, tools and training opportunities that enable you to succeed in your job and grow with the company. Depending on your tasks, hybrid working may be possible.

‍

Du liebst Daten und hast erkannt, dass sie das Gold der Zukunft sind? Du möchtest lernen, Zusammenhänge und Muster darin zu erkennen? Sehr gut, dann suchen wir Dich ab Oktober 2024 am Standort Stuttgart für unser berufsbegleitendes Masterprogramm!

Das Masterstudium zeichnet sich durch eine hohe Anwendungsorientierung aus und ermöglicht ein gewinnbringendes Studieren in Verbindung mit dem Beruf. Dabei wird dir im theoretischen Teil des Studiums modernes Wissen, Vorgehensweisen und Tools in den Bereichen Datenanalyse, maschinelles Lernen, künstliche Intelligenz und Big Data vermittelt. Du lernst, wie Du Daten effektiv erfasst, verarbeitest, analysierst und modellierst, um große Datenmengen gewinnbringend zu nutzen, komplexe Probleme zu lösen und eine datenbasierte Entscheidungsfindung zu unterstützen.

Studiendauer: voraussichtlich 5 Semester

Deine Aufgaben

Das Masterstudium Data Science & Business Analytics bei DYMATRIX beinhaltet 3 Schwerpunkte: Data Management, Marketing Automation & Costumer Analytics/ Data Science. Nach dem Studium bist Du also in der Lage, die Kundenansprache von Unternehmen in Form von Marketingkampagnen mit Hilfe von Daten zu optimieren.

Data Management

Du wirst bei uns im Bereich Solutions & Consulting eingesetzt – und lernst so die technische und fachliche Grundlage für unser Business kennen:


Du erlebst, wie theoretische Vorlesungsinhalte zu „Business Intelligence“ und „Data Warehousing“ in der Praxis angewendet werden und arbeitest Dich mit unserer Unterstützung in die Themen ein. So bleiben ETL-Prozesse, OLAP-Cubes und Reportings für Dich nicht nur graue Theorie, sondern werden Bestandteil spannender Projektarbeit.
Du hebst das Datengold, indem Du lernst, komplexe Datenarchitekturen zur Massendaten- (BIG DATA) oder Echtzeitdatenverarbeitung zu konzipieren und zu realisieren.
Du sorgst für die Umsetzung auf Basis neuester Technologien unserer führenden Technikpartner, lässt das Gold in Social-Media-Plattformen fließen und optimierst den Fluss durch z.B. InMemory-Datenbanken.
… und dabei bleibst Du nicht stehen, sondern erschließt neue Goldminen und arbeitest Dich mit unserer Unterstützung in neue Technologien ein.


Marketing Automation:


Du erhältst Einblick in herausfordernde Prozesse im Bereich Marketing Automation und Customer Monitoring und unterstützt uns bei der Umsetzung.
Du sorgst für die Umsetzung Deines erworbenen Wissens rund um Data Management/ Business Analytics und Data Science, um die Marketingkampagnen unserer Kundenunternehmen zu automatisieren und zu optimieren.


Im letzten Semester arbeitest Du in Analytics-Projekten mit und hilfst gemeinsam mit uns dabei, das Datengold unserer Kunden weiter zu veredeln.

Customer Analytics/ Data Science


Anhand von Algorithmen und Modellen sagst Du vorher, was ein Kunde / eine Kundin wollen wird – vielleicht ohne, dass er / sie es selbst schon weiß!
Du optimierst den Gutscheinversand, prognostizierst Kündigungswahrscheinlichkeiten oder hilfst, die Zweitkaufrate zu steigern.
Dazu arbeitest du mit Daten in verschiedenen Speichersystemen (z.B. Hadoop, relationale Datenbanken, NoSQL) und bereitest die Inhalte für die konkrete Analysefragestellung auf.
Außerdem nutzt du statistische Software (KNIME, Apache Spark, R, Python …) um Analysen durchzuführen und verschiedene Data Mining-Modelle zu entwickeln.


Die dazugehörigen Vorlesungen und theoretischen Lehrinhalte werden Dir an einer unserer Kooperationshochschulen (z.B. HdM), ggf. in Form eines mehrstufigen Kontaktstudiums vermittelt.

Das Bringst Du Idealerweise Mit


abgeschlossenes Bachelor- oder Diplomstudium (mindestens 210 ECTS) in Wirtschaftsinformatik, -mathematik, -wissenschaften, Ökonometrie, Statistik, Psychologie, Physik, Informatik oder vergleichbare Studiengänge
mindestens eine einjährige einschlägige Berufserfahrung nach dem ersten Hochschulstudium
ausgeprägte analytische und konzeptionelle Denkweise
Programmieraffinität
Interesse an CRM/Marketing
sehr gute Präsentations- und Kommunikationsfähigkeiten
gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse

Benedikt – Full Stack Developer in Stuttgart

» As a full stack developer, I enjoy working independently the most. This requires you to be actively involved in discussions and always evaluate whether you can provide support somewhere else. Sometimes you have to put your own needs on the back burner and say: ‘OK, I'm going to help the team now. There may be something more important that serves the general goal.' You are always involved in solving problems that have arisen that were not foreseeable - that is in the nature of things. But there is no case that is impossible or unsolvable. You just have to plan well and see where you can get the help you need to solve the problem. «

Som Automation Developer hos Telenor løser du komplekse problemstillinger og leverer forretningskritiske services. Du får metodefrihed, adgang til AI-værktøjer og mulighed for selv at definere, hvordan opgaverne løses. Interesseret?

""Hvis du kan lide at kode, automatisere og optimere – og samtidig vil have stor indflydelse i en rolle med brede snitflader og masser af metodefrihed, så er det her jobbet for dig""

– Jacob Ankerstrøm, Manager

Fra kode til automation skaber du innovation, der gør en reel forskel

Som Automation Developer bliver du en del af teamet IT Process Automation, der tilhører Telenors Technology-division. Teamet er sat i verden med henblik på at drive de platforme, som understøtter organisationen inden for business service management og procesautomatisering.

Vi samarbejder tæt med forretningen om at udvikle løsninger, der ikke blot løser dagligdagens behov, men også understøtter Telenors langsigtede mål – både operationelt og strategisk. Forude venter en spændende periode med et større transformationsprojekt, hvor teamet får en central rolle – og her får vi brug for dig!

Som vores nye kollega får du mulighed for at arbejde med procesautomatisering og enterprise service management på tværs af flere platforme, herunder ServiceNow og UiPath. Du designer og udvikler flows, koder og konfigurerer systemer samt opsætter API’er og integrationer, der alt sammen skaber værdi på tværs af organisationen.

Du omsætter forretningskrav til tekniske løsninger ved hjælp af dine formidlingsevner

I denne rollefår du frie tøjler til at omsætte forretningskrav til tekniske løsninger, der rent faktisk nytter. Du får lov til at dykke ned i JavaScript, eventuelt suppleret af Python, PowerShell og .NET (C#) for at bygge smarte, skalerbare systemer, der holder organisationen kørende.

Du bliver således arkitekten bag robuste integrationer og workflows, hvor din erfaring med databasehåndtering, objektorienteret programmering og API’er får plads til at skinne. Og bare rolig – du står ikke alene! Du kommer til at arbejde tæt sammen med et team, der deler din passion for automatisering og smarte løsninger.

Ved hjælp af tæt dialog med stakeholders sikrer du, at løsningerne understøtter forretningens behov. Derfor er det vigtigt, at du formår at kommunikere tekniske idéer på en letforståelig måde, arbejde struktureret og have et holistisk blik på opgaverne.

Har du en bachelor eller kandidat i Computer Science, Computer Teknologi, Datalogi eller lignende? Fedt! Certificeringer i ITIL, ServiceNow eller UiPath? Cool, men ikke et must. Erfaring med Telco, ServiceNow, Service Management eller RPA? Bonus! Dog håber vi mest af alt, at du har et ønske om at lykkes med det, du sætter dig for og deler vores ambition om at skabe tekniske løsninger, der understøtter forretningen.

En arbejdsplads fyldt med Fantastiske forbindelser

Som team har vi fokus på det tætte samarbejde og den uformelle omgangstone. Vi deler erfaringer og har det sjovt sammen – samtidig med, at vi opretholder et højt fagligt niveau. Læring er højt prioriteret og hos os får du frihed til at udvikle dig, så du kan vokse både personligt og professionelt.

Ønsker du at lære vores Technology-division bedre at kende? Læs mere her .

Du bliver en del af en foranderlig organisation, hvor der, på tværs af forretningen, venter dedikerede og dygtige kolleger, som kontinuerligt arbejder for at udvikle fremtidens teleselskab. Vi arbejder agilt, fokuserer indsatsområder ved hjælp af Kanban og praktiserer Tight-Loose-Tight som ledelsesfilosofi.

Interesseret?

Har du spørgsmål, eller vil du vide mere om stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte Manager, Jacob Ankerstrøm via kontaktoplysningerne til højre.

Kan du se dig selv i rollen, og har du interesse i at blive vores nye Fantastiske forbindelse, søger du blot stillingen via linket her på siden. Du behøver ikke skrive en ansøgning, men vi ser gerne et CV fra dig. Derudover har du mulighed for at sætte et par ord på dig selv gennem vores ansøgningsskema.

Vi ser frem til at høre fra dig hurtigst muligt, men senest den 9. marts 2025.

Does this sound highly appealing to you? Then you might be our new Machine Learning Researcher at Alipes Capital.




At Alipes Capital, we have been the market leader in automating the financial markets since we started back in 2008, shaping a fully automatic natural language processing system for reading and interpreting financial news.




To accomplish our mission of being the best at what we do, we understand the importance of elevating our predictive modeling standards to the highest levels. Your work will involve leading the efforts in creating a world class modeling workflow, enabling the team to seamlessly turn massive data sets of financial information into mathematical models that accurately predict movements in the financial markets.




In doing so, you will get a chance to tackle a variety of software infrastructure challenges, such as:

Development and optimization of calibration and benchmarking frameworks
Building out and implementing best practices for data preparation and dataset generation pipelines
Prototyping and releasing novel predictive architectures, especially with respect to time-series models.




You will get instant validation of your work and experience short feedback cycles, where going from inception to deployment can be a matter of hours. There will be no red tape to cut and no sales people to consult.




About the team

All of this will happen in an informal atmosphere where technical discussions are valued, and you are encouraged to take ownership of, and pride in, your work. You will impact the direction of the team, prioritize your work and choose the tools that get the job done. We are a tight-knit modeling team with fourteen passionate quantitative researchers covering 6 nationalities – eleven PhD’s and three MSc’s with expertise in statistical analysis, mathematical modeling and machine learning. We enjoy collaboration and are always willing to lend a helping hand. We are working alongside two other teams of software developers and traders that implement and conceive the mathematical models together with us. What makes this constellation work great is that all of the individual team members write code and understand that a seemingly trivial change can actually require a lot of work, and vice versa.




About you

Fluency within mathematics and statistics
Experience working with the full Machine Learning stack from data generation through model calibration and real-life validation and monitoring
Programming experience with Python, in particular data-wrangling and numerical programming
Proficiency with computer science fundamentals
A scientific and inquisitive mind




Nice to have

Experience working with ‘out-of-core’ datasets
Experience working with tools like PyTorch, Tensorflow, XGBoost and/or Catboost
Programming experience with languages like C# and C/C++
PhD or MSc degree in engineering, physics, computer science, mathematics or economics




What we can offer you

Flat hierarchy and high levels of trust and autonomy
Exciting problems to solve
Collaborative team made up of really smart and curious people
Nice office in central Copenhagen with a hybrid work model
Pension, Health Insurance and 30 days of vacation




Practicalities

To apply, please send us your CV and a cover letter telling us why you think this role is a great fit for you. If your profile looks like a good match, we will get in touch to coordinate an online technical test as a first step in the interview process.

With more than 3000 employees Deloitte is the largest audit and consultancy firm in Denmark. We tailor solutions across Audit, Tax, Financial Advisory Services, Enterprise Risk Services, and Technology & Transformation.

Are you curious about modern software development and looking for your next challenge? At Deloitte Engineering, we are seeking recent or soon-to-be graduates, who want to take an active role in improving their technical and problem-solving competencies while growing our Engineering practice.

About The Team

We, the Engineering offering of Deloitte Technology & Transformation Denmark, are on the lookout for additional team-players for our quickly growing practice of software engineers, architects, cloud consultants, and IT management consultants. We assist our clients, some of the largest companies, agencies, and organizations in Denmark and the Nordics, on the implementation of new cloud-native systems as part of their digital transformation – and we need you to help build their opportunities and meet their challenges!

Together, we will accelerate your career towards becoming a proficient software developer. At Deloitte, we are committed to empowering you throughout your career development. As a new employee, you are assigned a talent manager to support your career aspirations and development. You will also be part of a tech community with monthly meetings in which we share knowledge, investigate new topics, and upskill within relevant technologies and methodologies.

Job Description

As a software developer at the Engineering offering, you will work with many different aspects of development, from writing code to testing it. You will work closely with both clients and internal stakeholders to ensure that our solutions meet their business needs and technical requirements. Our client assignments can vary greatly, but common for all of them are that we strive to work with the technologies that the client prefers. Regardless of the technology, we provide you with the opportunity and tools needed to learn and grow within all of them.

In this role, you will make an impact by:


Developing applications and solutions of all sizes, frequently in Agile settings (SAFE/Scrum). This includes both backend and frontend development.
Assisting in the implementation of CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC), and adopting DevOps practices to streamline development workflows.
Building internal capabilities through community tasks, maybe within new business areas.
Joining in on workshops and sales pitches and contributing to proposals for new client projects.


Qualifications

You hold or will hold a Master’s degree, preferably with a focus on Computer Science, Engineering, or other relevant fields such as Information Technology or Software Development. Perhaps you have experience from previous part- or full-time software development positions, utilizing your analytical and problem-solving skill set. Furthermore, you are either a native Danish speaker or highly proficient in written and spoken Danish.

What you bring to the team:


Experience in Java, C#/.NET, JavaScript, TypeScript, or one or more other widely used programming languages.
Some experience with modern DevOps practices such as CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, and test automation.
You have strong analytical skills and a focus on quality and detail.
You are a positive-minded teammate with the ability to work and solve problems in a structured way.
You can communicate and express yourself clearly and concisely, both orally and in writing.


Even if you do not see yourself in all the bullets above, we still encourage you to apply if you believe your skills can make an impact on our team.

What we can offer you:

We highly appreciate the knowledge, experience, and perspectives our consultants bring, and in exchange, we make sure they develop professionally, meet their career goals, and enjoy their time with Deloitte. Therefore, other than an incredible social calendar, we offer our consultants:


Enrollment in the Consultant Academy, which is our training program for building essential Consultant skills. The Academy takes you to exciting locations to learn from leading professionals in their respective fields.
Focused career development by assigning you a talent manager who acts as your mentor and guides you in your professional journey in Deloitte.
The opportunity to participate in projects and internal work with our different market offerings to find the right fit for you.


On the social aspect, Deloitte Technology & Transformation is second to none. We offer everything from various sports communities to festivals – not to mention the yearly Trip where all our colleagues come together off-site to create lasting memories. Additionally, we have a strong sense of belonging and community in Engineering, and we support each other every day to make an impact with our clients and to promote personal and professional development.

Her får du muligheden for at bringe dine tekniske evner i spil og bidrage til et miljø kendetegnet ved høj faglighed og samarbejde.

Om afdelingen og teamet

I Data Foundation bliver du en del af Data Platform-teamet, som arbejder målrettet på at gøre data tilgængeligt og værdiskabende for hele TV 2. Teamet består af seks erfarne data engineers og en ML engineer, der sammen skaber løsninger til både store strategiske projekter og daglige udfordringer. Her får du mulighed for at arbejde i et miljø med høj faglighed, hvor samarbejde med eksperter inden for data science, analyse og visualisering er en del af hverdagen.

Derudover vil du blive ansvarlig for at skabe løsninger, der er skalerbare, effektive og klar til at understøtte TV 2s ambitioner inden for machine learning og AI.

Dine primære opgaver vil være at:



Produktionssætning af ML-modeller: Arbejd tæt med data scientists for at sikre robuste og værdiskabende løsninger.
Udvikling og vedligehold af ML-platformen: Udnyt Databricks og Azure-services til at skabe morgendagens ML-platform i TV 2, der understøtter fremtidige behov inden for ML og AI.
Byg CI/CD-pipelines: Design og implementér workflows med GitHub Actions.
Overvågning og sikkerhed: Sørg for stabil drift og høj kvalitet af produktionssatte løsninger.
Teknisk sparringspartner: Definér udviklingsprincipper og vær en teknisk sparringspartner på tværs af organisationen.

Har en teknisk baggrund inden for matematik, datalogi, data science eller et beslægtet felt.
Har et par års professionel erfaring med machine learning engineering eller beslægtede felter.
Forstår machine learning-projekters livscyklus – fra dataforberedelse til implementering.
Er velbevandret i Python og har kendskab til frameworks som MLflow og scikit-learn.
Erfaring med at arbejde på cloud-platforme som Azure, AWS eller Google.
Fortrolig med software engineering best practices og CI/CD-pipelines.
Har kendskab til containerization og REST API’er.



Det vigtigste er, at du har interesse i at udvikle dig og bidrage til videreudviklingen af vores ML-platform i et miljø, hvor samarbejde og faglig udvikling er i fokus

TV 2 som arbejdsplads

I TV 2s teknologiske område arbejder mere end 350 medarbejdere dedikeret med at understøtte og realisere den koncernstrategiske målsætning om 1,3 millioner Play-abonnenter i 2025.

Målsætningen, der udspringer af 2025-strategien 'TV 2 Play til alle', forudsætter et solidt teknologisk fundament, der gør det muligt for TV 2 også i fremtiden at levere dansk kvalitetsindhold og public service, som danskerne har let adgang til og interesse i at samles om.

TV 2 investerer derfor i disse år massivt i udviklingen og driften af hele den teknologiske værdikæde fra medieteknologi og tv-produktion til digital produktudvikling. Alt sammen med det formål at sikre, at vi imødekommer danskernes behov og forventninger i et omskifteligt marked med stigende, international konkurrence.

Teknologiorganisationen er placeret i både Odense og København, og vi beskæftiger blandt andre Software Engineers, UX-designere, Product Managers, Solution Architects, produktionsspecialister og Data Scientists.

We are looking for an NLP Researcher that will help us greatly improve the text-processing behind our models.




At Alipes Capital, we have been the market leader in automating the financial markets since we started back in 2008, shaping a fully automatic natural language processing system for reading and interpreting financial news.




Your work

Your work will support turning massive data sets of unstructured financial information into structured datasets and mathematical models that accurately predict movements in the equity markets. In doing so, you will:

Redesign and introduce new text-processing techniques to extract additional and more accurate entities from the text-sources that underlie our trading algorithms
Maintain and curate new and existing text data sources for our analyses
Automate monitoring and benchmarking of the trading strategies




You will enjoy a wide degree of autonomy and responsibility to optimize our machine-learning pipelines, from data-ingestion to live-model performance. There is no red tape, no sales people to consult and there is ample room for creativity.




The team

All of this will happen in an informal atmosphere where technical discussions are valued and you are encouraged to take ownership of, and pride in, your work. You will impact the direction of the team, prioritize your work and choose the tools that get the job done. We are a tight-knit modeling team with fourteen passionate quantitative researchers covering six nationalities – eleven PhD’s and three MSc’s- with expertise in statistical analysis, mathematical modeling and machine learning (seven of us working directly on the text-based equity models).




We enjoy collaboration, lending a helping hand and discussing the business cases built upon our data-sets. You will be working alongside a team of software developers and a team of traders who implement and conceive the trading models with us. All team members write code and are not afraid to discuss technical details.




Need to have

Skilled in extracting signals from texts using embeddings to enhance prediction model
Proficient in entity-extraction from text, e.g. using modern Transformer-based Large-Language Models
Solid understanding of machine learning techniques and their practical applications
Aptitude for programming in a numerical scripting language (we primarily use Python)
A meticulous and detail-oriented mind




Nice to have

Experience using RAGs (Retrieval-Augmentation-Generation)
Working with financial/trading data
Experience with C#, C/C++ or Java
Familiarity with software engineering (version control, unit testing, object oriented-design)
Degree in Computer Science / Engineering




What we can offer you

Flat hierarchy and high levels of trust and autonomy
Exciting problems to solve
Collaborative team made up of really smart and curious people
Nice office in central Copenhagen with a hybrid work model
Pension, Health Insurance and 30 days of vacation




Practicalities

To apply, please send us your CV and a cover letter telling us why you think this role is a great fit for you. In your cover letter, if applicable, please describe a project where you extracted structured or unstructured information from text - including the techniques, tools, models used and how those extractions informed further decisions/predictions.

If you're selected for an interview, we will be very interested in discussing technical details with you about this project!

Should your profile look like a good match, we will get in touch to coordinate an online technical test as a first step in the interview process.

Det vigtigste er, at du har interesse i at udvikle dig og bidrage til videreudviklingen af vores ML-platform i et miljø, hvor samarbejde og faglig udvikling er i fokus

TV 2 som arbejdsplads

I TV 2s teknologiske område arbejder mere end 350 medarbejdere dedikeret med at understøtte og realisere den koncernstrategiske målsætning om 1,3 millioner Play-abonnenter i 2025.

Målsætningen, der udspringer af 2025-strategien 'TV 2 Play til alle', forudsætter et solidt teknologisk fundament, der gør det muligt for TV 2 også i fremtiden at levere dansk kvalitetsindhold og public service, som danskerne har let adgang til og interesse i at samles om.

TV 2 investerer derfor i disse år massivt i udviklingen og driften af hele den teknologiske værdikæde fra medieteknologi og tv-produktion til digital produktudvikling. Alt sammen med det formål at sikre, at vi imødekommer danskernes behov og forventninger i et omskifteligt marked med stigende, international konkurrence.

Teknologiorganisationen er placeret i både Odense og København, og vi beskæftiger blandt andre Software Engineers, UX-designere, Product Managers, Solution Architects, produktionsspecialister og Data Scientists.

Launch Program

Role

The Launch program is a development program that is supplemental to the role and is designed to help you transition from being a student to being a Mastercard employee. In this program, you will participate in:


Four-day orientation focused on getting to know Mastercard, building your skills, and be a force for good (Mastercard’s culture)
Technical orientation focused on an introduction to tools, policies, and processes that are key to your role
Professional skills workshops
Launch innovation week
Social impact – pro bono team challenge
Global volunteer challenge



Role Description

As a Software Engineer I, you will have the opportunity to:


write high-quality code with a focus on security, design, and maintainability.
contribute to all phases of software development from design through rollout.
find real-life solutions for our clients and the world.



Software engineers working on Mastercard's open banking platform play a key role in the development and maintenance of the products that secure high quality connectivity to banks across Europe. Building on the strong foundation of our state-of-the-art bank connectivity APIs, the engineers create turn-key solutions that take the burden of handling account information and payment initiation services from customers that want to spend their efforts building great products that leverage the full potential of the open banking standard.

Open banking engineers work at the bleeding edge of the account information and payment initiation technologies, often solving problems that are yet to be tackled within the industry in areas of API security, data accessibility, processing, and analysis. You will be joining a group of highly skilled individuals working together as a team to push the limits of what is possible to achieve with open banking.

You will have many colleagues around different countries, with your nearest peers being located primarily in Denmark, Ireland, Poland, and Romania.

You will be spending most of your time in the Microsoft domain, meaning APIs built in C# with .NET (latest version) and ASP.NET deployed to the cloud (Azure). Knowledge of at least some of these areas is a great benefit. However, we believe that learning is a part of the job, so do not hesitate to apply even you have not worked with these technologies before. After all, we are looking for talented engineers, regardless of background.

Come join us!

Location: Copenhagen

What You’ll Do

Cloudflare’s solutions engineering function is responsible for collaborating with clients from early-stage ideation through to planning for production. Being much more than an expert solely in Cloudflare’s services, our Senior Solutions Engineers are expected to sit alongside our peers in our clients, and to contribute their energy, ideas and opinion on solving the hard problems we face in our industry today. Often this means deep work on the art-of-the possible (and sometimes being willing to put aside preconceptions on the impossible!).

On any given day, the role will provide both a challenging and rewarding opportunity to develop adjacent technology expertise as well as mastering key skills relating to technical and industry advocacy on behalf of our clients. A key aspect will be offering good* practice guidance and adopting a deploy-to-production mindset, where it is as much about the operational process as it is about the product.

As part of our broader solutions engineering community, you will be working alongside peers with deep subject-matter expertise and industry knowledge upon whose insights will support your own. Of course, as a senior member of the team, you will also be in a position to contribute to a body-of-knowledge across key domains of networking, cybersecurity and edge computing, as well as industry analyses and perspectives.

For this role, our Solutions Engineering team members focus on large clients for whom we are able to develop deep understanding and partnership to collaborate with. Building on a track-record of success, this role has an emphasis on supporting our clients in both local and central government, as well as select private sector clients where appropriate. Previous experience in supporting the public sector is beneficial, however not mandatory.


As an SE, there will often be more than one way to solve a problem - hence what might be a best practice in a given context might not be true in another!. This is where your experience will help.



Who We Are

The problems that our clients face are both diverse and unique - which is reflected in how we think about our Solution Engineering team. Building on the benefit of the hive-mind, our SE team is made up of individuals from a wide range of backgrounds - from end-customers to other vendors, Financial Consulting to Product Management, Customer Support to Software Engineering. In short, if we are to solve complex problems we need a diverse, curious and collaborative team.

Cloudflare’s mission is one which is both simple and timeless, to help build a better Internet. This requires a broad set of services and associated knowledge of Internet performance and security technology. We recognise many of our team usually join us with one or two core domains of expertise, however key to success is the curiosity to maintain and develop new knowledge which is essential to keeping up with the high rate of product innovation at Cloudflare.

In our aim to support your success, all the resources and training required to build a custom personal development plan to be effective for the role, will be provided.

As mentioned, the emphasis on working with public sector clients would benefit from having previously held Security Clearance (SC) status, however this is not mandatory.

Examples Of Desirable Skills, Knowledge And Experience

Our Solutions Engineers come from a wide range of backgrounds: IT, engineering, software development, product management, financial consulting, customer support & project delivery. We're serious about building a diverse team. When hiring we look for diversity of experience combined with genuine curiosity for our technology.

Ultimately, you are passionate about technology and have the ability to explain complex technical concepts in easy-to-understand terms. You are naturally curious, and an avid builder who is not afraid to get your hands dirty. You appreciate the diversity of challenges in working with customers, and look forward to helping them realise the full promise of Cloudflare. On the Solutions Engineering team, you will find a collaborative environment where everyone brings different strengths and jumps in to help each other.

You will have a good fundamental understanding on how to manage technical validation projects so that customers can have an informed opinion on the best solution to a given problem - with an eye on what could come next.

Additional experience might include a combination of the skills below:


Showing up in the right-way: bringing a positive attitude, open-minded to new ideas and bringing your energy and ideas to help our clients and our team succeed.
8+ years of experience in the IT industry (mid-level or senior engineering level experience).
Ability to manage a project, work to deadlines, and prioritise between competing demands.
Demonstrating empathy with customers and quickly identifying challenges and pain points they face.
Understanding of “how the internet works”. For example:
Know the differences between TCP & UDP, and understand what kinds of applications may favour one over the other;
Can explain the difference between authoritative DNS & recursive DNS?;
You understand the role of a firewall, why TLS (SSL) plays an increasingly important role on today's Internet, a solid understanding of HTTP and a willingness to dive deeper into the quirks of clients & servers alike;
Understanding of how customers make buying decisions, how to explain ROI.
A knowledge of the competitive landscape for one or more of: DDoS, CDN, Performance, DNS, Developer platform or Zero-Trust/SASE service providers.
You're OK with some in-region travel (15:30 days per quarter): eg. Being next to our clients means that we need to travel to customer offices, conferences and/or events.
Located within commuting distance from Copenhagen for customer meetings


Bonus!


Previous experience in a pre-sales SE or consulting role. (note: doesn't have to be in tech);
Demonstrated experience with a scripting language (e.g. Python, JavaScript, Bash) and a desire to expand those skills;
Exposure to emerging technical landscape trends such as machine learning, GenAI, DevOps, security operations etc.



What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Har du evnen og interessen for at prøve kræfter med udvikling af komplekse Azure cloud-løsninger? cVation søger erfarne software udviklere til at indgå i vores voksende team, hvor høj faglighed, innovation og udviklerglæde er i højsæde.




cVation er et dansk udviklings- og konsulenthus, som bygger avancerede cloud-løsninger på Azure med afsæt i markedets hurtigste og mest agile metoder. cVation blev stiftet i 2014, har modtaget tre Børsen Gazeller og vundet Microsofts Partner Award for App Innovation tre år i træk. Vi arbejder dedikeret med agile arbejdsmetoder, DevOps og Test Driven Development, og er på forkant med mange af de nye teknologier, herunder IoT. Vi sætter desuden en ære i at levere software af den højeste kvalitet.

Hvilken rolle får du?




Du vil blive en del af et team, der designer og udvikler avancerede cloud-løsninger på MS Azure. Din rolle bliver bl.a. at rådgive om valg af Azure services, implementere og vedligeholde værktøjer, der sikrer continuous integration og continuous delivery og understøtter applikationsudviklingen. Vi har en meget høj release-frekvens i vores projekter, da brugen af vores egenudviklede tool CADD resulterer i ekstremt agile IT-projekter.




Udviklerne i cVation er samlet i teams på 5-8 udviklere. Du vil have fuldt fokus på et projekt/team af gangen. Ud over de hyppige releases til produktion har vi en ekstrem høj grad af automatisering af alt fra unit tests til integrationstests og UI-tests. Det betyder, at de repetitive processer er fjernet, så der er luft til at tænke innovativt, hvilket kommer vores kunder til gode. Kort sagt får de hurtigere udviklede løsninger af højere kvalitet og med en større forretningsmæssig værdi – og du får mulighed for faglig fordybelse og udvikle dig indenfor de nyeste teknologier.




Vi har også etableret et CCoE (Cloud Center of Excellence), som løbende vurderer nye cloud services og opdaterer værktøjskassen med relevante opdateringer. CCoE arbejder tæt sammen med de enkelte udviklingsteams, som har fingeren på pulsen ude på kundeprojekterne.

Hvad forventer vi af dig?




Erfaring med cloud udvikling og særligt PaaS services fra MS Azure, vil være en klar fordel.

Kandidat i softwareudvikling
Du er erfaren i C#, og at du går op i kodekvalitet og at skrive testbar kode
Du vil gerne arbejde med de nyeste teknologier i Azure med hovedfokus på PaaS
Du har erfaring med at arbejde med automatisering af byg og test af applikationer
Du har erfaring med softwareudvikling og gerne webudvikling
Du vil gerne indgå i et agilt setup, hvor krav og retning hurtigt kan ændres, men hvor medbestemmelse og frihed er i højsædet
Du har arbejdet med automatisering af test, build og release pipelines samt Infrastructure as code
Du er vant til at arbejde med versionskontrol, gerne Git
Du taler/skriver flydende dansk, og taler/skriver engelsk på et medium/højt niveau.

Som person er du ansvarsbevidst, initiativrig, eksekverende og resultatorienteret. Du gør dig umage med dine opgaver og trives med at løfte i flok som del af et team. Hvis du også er engageret, nysgerrig, drevet af at lære nyt og sætter en ære i at dygtiggøre dig passer du perfekt ind hos os. Du må også gerne gå op i at forbedre både kode, værktøjer samt processer.

Hvad tilbyder vi?




Du kommer til at indgå i vores voksende team, hvor høj faglighed, innovation og arbejdsglæde er i højsæde. Det høje faglige niveau blandt dine kollegaer giver en unik mulighed for at arbejde med de bedste, og vi tager din faglige udvikling alvorligt. Vi har en flad organisation med et minimum af administration, hvor ledelsens døre altid er åbne, og der er god plads til både bordfodbold, fredagsbar, frokost på kajen og et aktivt liv udenfor arbejdstid. Flere gange om året afholder vi hackathons, hvor vi i teams dykker ned i præcis de emner, som udviklerne finder interessante. En del af vores kultur er også, at vi gerne ser alle komme med input til hvordan vi kan optimere, forbedre og udvikle cVation.

Hvorfor vælge os som din nye arbejdsplads?




Vores fundament er løsninger bygget på Microsoft Azure Cloud. Alle vores medarbejdere mestrer cloud-native udvikling og DevOps. Vi arbejder i projekter og engagerer os hands-on i fælles teams med vores kunder for at sikre kvalitet og effektiv videndeling.




Vi er passionerede omkring at hjælpe vores kunder med at få det maksimale ud af cloudteknologien. For os er cloud ikke blot infrastruktur eller et nyt datacenter i skyen. Teknologien giver virksomheder mulighed for at skabe væsentligt mere værdi og arbejde med agilitet og innovation på en helt ny måde.




Vi har været med fra starten, da cloud blev udviklet og tilgængeligt. Vi tilbyder således vores årelange erfaring og dybe cloud ekspertise samt en værktøjskasse med alle vores best practices i form af accelerationsplatformen CADD. Den dækker over gennemprøvede værktøjer, rammeværk, effektive udviklingsmetoder og færdige automatiseringskomponenter. Alt dette for at sikre, at projekter kommer hurtigt og sikkert fra start.




Du vil få kollegaer, der er interesseret i at lære og har ønske om at blive de bedste til det, de gør. Vi tilbyder derfor gode muligheder for at udvikle dig. Du vil blive en del af en virksomhed, som tror på, at alle har betydning, og at det skal være sjovt at gå på arbejde hver dag.

It is desirable to have experience in MRI sequence programming
Strong communication and collaborative skills.
Previous experience with MRI acquisition and data analysis is a requirement.


Your Tasks


To work directly with neuroimaging researchers to ensure that our research studies, in particular our small vessel disease studies take full advantage of the clinical information available in the multi-parametric MRI images (structural, functional and metabolic) as well as from the cognitive and functional tests.
To develop novel sequences and imaging analysis methods.
To advance the field through your own research.
To engage in internal education, grant writing, knowledge dissemination, and publication of results in international, recognized scientific journals.


Your Position

You will be employed for a three-year period at the Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance where you will be part of the Ultra-high-field MR group.

Salary And Terms Of Employment

Salary, pension and terms of employment are in accordance with the agreement between the Danish Regions (Danske Regioner) and the relevant professional organization. The salary depends on background education and seniority. Further, supplements can be negotiated. Note that candidates coming from abroad may be eligible for tax reductions. The position is open for candidates of all nationalities. We see diversity as strength and encourage everyone regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, disabilities or religion to apply.

Applications should include a cover letter, CV and list of publications. Applications must be submitted online through the Region H job portal. Click HERE.

Application deadline: 1 December 2021 at 08:00 (CET)

Python Engineer (APIs,Pandas, NumPy) Tech firm. REMOTE, £35k plus bonus.

I'm proud to be working exclusively with a growing technology business who are truly a force to be reckoned with, within their chosen industry. They're looking for a true Python enthusiast to join their tech team at what couldn't be a more busy and more exciting time for them.

These guys produce software that essentially helps companies save £££ using state-of-the-art systems and only the best technology choices. They have built and shipped an application that is already utilised by some huge, well-known organisations yet they haven't even scratched the surface of where they want to take it.

You're gonna work across all phases of the Dev life-cycle from planning and design through to operation and maintenance. What I LOVE about this role is that you will be able to really get your teeth stuck into deploying exciting new solutions working closely with clients to help them achieve their perfect solution!

Tech wise you'll love coding in Python and have exposure to Pandas and NumPy. Your database experience will be in MySQL and you'll also be a Cloud enthusiast using AWS as a platform (Lambda and CloudTrail).

You'll join a cracking team and rub shoulders with some super talented Python Engineers who really know their stuff. The best part of this role is undoubtedly the people you will be working for. The Directors are fantastic with a real vision for the evolution of the company and they look after their people incredibly well.

ALSO!... They have just received a huge £££ investment which will result in numerous new hires into the business and overall tech investment into their amazing product.

You can work remotely - with one day a month within their West Midlands based office and in return you will receive up to £35k DOE plus bonus!) and much more.
