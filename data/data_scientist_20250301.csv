We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to help people build beautiful tools for their life’s work. The Growth Team aims to accelerate Notion's reach and impact by making the product more valuable to our users and in doing so grow our business. As a growth data scientist, you'll drive improvements to the user experience and our self-serve revenue engine through quantitative analysis and experimentation, in close partnership with the product team. You will be instrumental in defining the team's roadmap by identifying new opportunities, seeing through their execution, and rigorously evaluating their impact.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference and experimentation to understand the impact of product changes and drive decision making.
You will conduct analysis to identify opportunities for your team and help shape the strategy and roadmap.
You'll work with your teams to determine north star and operational metrics, and build the foundational datasets and dashboards to monitor progress and make key decisions.
You'll influence the broader company by communicating your findings and driving change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)



Skills You'll Need To Bring


You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product and engineering. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and motivated by business results.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if they don’t exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.



Nice To Haves


You have worked on a growth team.
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers.

Benefits

Roku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Are you looking for a place to graduate where you can gain hands-on experience in deploying, scaling, and maintaining AI-driven solutions? Do you want to bridge the gap between machine learning and production systems? Then join our team as an ML Engineering intern!

Why? 🤔

At Enjins we want to make Machine Learning solutions that are here to stay. Our mission is to become the go-to ML engineering company in the world of tech scale-ups, for both talent and customers.

How? 🚀

We are driven by impact, and so is our vision on Machine Learning. We don't want a data scientists' laptop to be a graveyard for brilliant models. That's why we created an approach that allows us to actually implement Machine Learning that realises business value. This approach demands our ML engineers to stand out in engineering, data science and consulting skills.

What? [You'll be doing] 👀

We are looking for an intern to strengthen our team in one of two exciting graduation projects. You'll work on innovative AI solutions, focusing on automation, deployment, and optimization of machine learning systems. Your research and implementation will contribute directly to real-world applications, working closely with our AI engineers in a dynamic environment of start- and scaleups.

Your responsibilities:


Design, develop, and optimize AI pipelines for scalable deployment.
Research best practices for monitoring, versioning, and automating AI workflows.
Implement solutions that enhance the efficiency and reliability of AI models in production.
Collaborate with a small team to bring innovative AI solutions to life.



Your graduation project options:


Oddit: We are currently developing an LLM-based application called Oddit that is able to create AI roadmaps and strategies based on inputs such as interviews, data quality scans and code reviews. Basically, we automate our own workflow. Within this project there are plenty GenAI research angles, that will have direct impact on our product (Oddit).
Your AI Engineering Pitch: Bring your own AI engineering topic related to our focus industries ClimateTech, Marketplaces, or Mobility. Whether it's optimizing an AI model performance in Energy, improving real-time data pipelines in a geospatial setting, or enhancing the AI system scalability for a large platform, we encourage you to pitch an AI idea that aligns with our focus industry.


Starting date: 1st of April or May: 4-6 months

Requirements

Who are you?:🚶‍♀️


You're graduating in a Master's Degree in AI, Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a similar (technical) field.
You have some experience with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure).
You're familiar with Python and have experience with CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and model deployment.
You are pragmatic, proactive, and thrive in small, agile teams.
You are fluent in at least English.
You like to build stuff; preferably you have an ambition to grow your skills in both software as well as AI/ML.



Benefits

What to expect from us: ⚡️

We look for people that want to enjoy the ride of a start-up and benefit from the freedom in the role:


A team of talented and ambitious ML engineers.
Insights into real-world AI challenges and deployment strategies.
The possibility of a full-time position as AI engineer at Enjins after your internship.

We will review your application against our job requirements. We do not employ machine learning technologies during this phase as we believe every human deserves attention from another human. We do not think machines can evaluate your application quite like our seasoned recruiting professionals—every person is unique. We promise to give your candidacy a fair and detailed assessment.
We may then invite you to submit a video interview for the review of the hiring manager. This video interview is often followed by a test or short project that allows us to determine whether you will be a good fit for the team.
At this point, we will invite you to interview with our hiring manager and/or the interview team. Please note: We do not conduct interviews via text message, Telegram, etc. and we never hire anyone into our organization without having met you face-to-face (or via Zoom). You will be invited to come to a live meeting or Zoom, where you will meet our INFUSE team.
From there on, it’s decision time! If you are still excited to join INFUSE and we like you as much, we will have a conversation about your offer.

Also, you will be responsible for designing an interface that allows users to easily access, compare, and analyze various development and manufacturing test data. Use of artificial intelligence tools is desirable to make the processes as simple as possible, and extendable for the future. As a stretch goal, a similar process can be applied to not only data but also documentation, i.e. create an automatic digital project history file or design history file.

Responsibilities

Data Pipeline Development and Integration


Identify and map out existing sources of test results, including SharePoint sites, software systems, and external databases.
Develop and implement a data pipeline framework to automatically centralize test results in a single cloud-based repository.
Collaborate cross-functionally with the IT and PSTO teams to ensure proper data extraction and integration from various platforms.


User Interface Development


Design and create a user-friendly dashboard that displays key test results for analysis and comparison for the PSTO team.
Ensure that the interface provides lot-to-lot comparisons, highlights out of specification results, and allows users to track trends over time.
Enable access to test method information to ensure transparency in data interpretation.


Ensure Compliance of the Platform


Work closely with the Quality and Regulatory teams to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and regulatory compliance of the integrated datasets.
Assist in creating documentation for data pipeline processes and system functionalities.


Collaboration and Communication


Engage with key stakeholders on cross-functional teams to gather relevant input and ensure alignment on PSTO initiatives.
Communicate effectively with team members, sharing insights, progress, and challenges in a clear and concise manner.
Deliver a final presentation at the end of the internship summarizing findings, demonstrating the developed interface, and proposing recommendations for future improvements.


Qualifications


Currently pursuing a degree in Engineering, Data Science, Computer Science, Life Sciences, or a related field.
Strong analytical skills with a keen interest in data integration and visualization.
Experience or coursework in Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, or other data analytics tools is preferred but not required.
Proficient in Microsoft Office Suite.
Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to work cross-functionally.


Astria’s Commitment

At Astria, we are committed to building a diverse team where every Astrian endorses the idea that people bring their authentic self to work. We embrace a patient-first, people-always culture which strives to ensure all Astrians and our collaborators have a sense of belonging and receive the support they need to thrive.

About CloudZero

Cloud cost management is one of the biggest challenges organizations face today. As cloud adoption accelerates, so do the complexities and associated costs - and macroeconomic conditions only increase pressure to prove cloud efficiency. That's why we built CloudZero: a SaaS platform at the intersection of next-generation cloud cost management and FinOps. CloudZero ingests billing and usage data from all cloud, SaaS, and PaaS providers, organizes it in real-time according to our customers' business structures, lets customers view it at any level of time or resource granularity, and ultimately empowers them to make more informed business decisions.

Since our founding in 2016, our mission has been to make efficient innovation a reality for every cloud-driven organization. At CloudZero, we believe every engineering decision is a buying decision, yet the cost conversation often bypasses the engineers who drive those determinations. To solve this, we've built a dynamic, single-page application that answers the complex, data-heavy questions every cloud-based organization needs to ask if they want to grow their company profitably.

To date, we've raised over from leading venture capital firms nationwide. We're solving problems of massive scale, business importance, and complexity in a space that needs it more than ever. We're growing rapidly and would love for you to be a part of it.

Applicants must be authorized to work for any employer in the United States. We cannot currently sponsor or take over the sponsorship of an Employment Visa.

The company was founded on the belief that understanding the repertoire of T cell receptor (TCR)-antigen immune synapses that maintain health and drive disease represents one of the greatest opportunities for innovation in medical science. Repertoire scientists created and developed the DECODETM platform, which allows in-depth characterization of TCR-antigen pairs, and the ability to deploy this information in the form of novel targeted immune medicines to fundamentally reprogram the immune system to kill tumors or induce immune homeostasis.

From its sites in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Zurich, Switzerland, Repertoire’s team is advancing a pipeline of DECODE-enabled immune medicines. For cancer, we are developing a pipeline of TCR bispecifics molecules for treatment of multiple cancer types. In addition, we are developing a pipeline of mRNA tolerizing vaccines for treatment of autoimmune diseases.

Repertoire was founded by Flagship Pioneering and is supported by a strong investor base. In addition, the company recently entered a strategic partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop tolerizing vaccines for up to three autoimmune diseases.

Role Overview

Repertoire Immune Medicines is seeking a Data Scientist to join the Computational Science team to enable the discovery of new insights from our extensive and growing immune synapse database. The successful candidate will work at the interface of computational biology, data science, machine learning, and statistics with broad impact across early discovery, candidate development, and biomarker discovery.

Key Responsibilities


Develop, evaluate, and implement rigorous analytical models and methods as needed for scientific discovery and development.
Assist in the conception, development, optimization, and assessment of machine-learning models for understanding the T-cell receptor-peptide-MHC interface.
Work alongside computer science engineers, wet-lab scientists, and project managers, contributing to early discovery, lead identification, lead optimization, and biomarker development.
Maintain familiarity with scientific literature to assist in the development and benchmarking of new methods.
Communicate findings both internally and externally via presentations and publication.


Qualifications/Experience


PhD in computational biology, machine learning, engineering, statistics, biostatistics, biomedical engineering, cancer biology, immunology, genetics or related field, or Master’s with 3+ years experience, and a strong academic record.
Demonstrated impact in multi-disciplinary, team-driven scientific projects.
Expertise in programming in Python (including e.g. numpy, scipy, pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow). Additional experience in R is helpful but not required.
Expertise in analyzing complex, high-dimensional datasets using scientific and computational best practices to make novel scientific discoveries.
Strong publication record.
Scientific curiosity and interest in working in a dynamic, rapidly developing field.
Background in immunology/immuno-oncology and experience working with single-cell sequencing data is a plus.


Repertoire is committed towards social responsibility and developing an inclusive culture. Much as the power of the immune system lies in the diversity of T and B cells, we believe that our work requires the creativity and ingenuity of a diverse workforce, and we are committed to pursuing that in all facets of the work experience at Repertoire. We will continue to educate ourselves about the inequities and barriers present in our society and act as a company where we can make a difference.

The company was founded on the belief that understanding the repertoire of T cell receptor (TCR)-antigen immune synapses that maintain health and drive disease represents one of the greatest opportunities for innovation in medical science. Repertoire scientists created and developed the DECODETM platform, which allows in-depth characterization of TCR-antigen pairs, and the ability to deploy this information in the form of novel targeted immune medicines to fundamentally reprogram the immune system to kill tumors or induce immune homeostasis.

From its sites in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Zurich, Switzerland, Repertoire’s team is advancing a pipeline of DECODE-enabled immune medicines. For cancer, we are developing a pipeline of TCR bispecifics molecules for treatment of multiple cancer types. In addition, we are developing a pipeline of mRNA tolerizing vaccines for treatment of autoimmune diseases.

Repertoire was founded by Flagship Pioneering and is supported by a strong investor base. In addition, the company recently entered a strategic partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop tolerizing vaccines for up to three autoimmune diseases.

Role Overview

Repertoire Immune Medicines is seeking a Data Scientist to join the Computational Science team to enable the discovery of new insights from our extensive and growing immune synapse database. The successful candidate will work at the interface of computational biology, data science, machine learning, and statistics with broad impact across early discovery, candidate development, and biomarker discovery.

Key Responsibilities


Develop, evaluate, and implement rigorous analytical models and methods as needed for scientific discovery and development.
Assist in the conception, development, optimization, and assessment of machine-learning models for understanding the T-cell receptor-peptide-MHC interface.
Work alongside computer science engineers, wet-lab scientists, and project managers, contributing to early discovery, lead identification, lead optimization, and biomarker development.
Maintain familiarity with scientific literature to assist in the development and benchmarking of new methods.
Communicate findings both internally and externally via presentations and publication.


Qualifications/Experience


PhD in computational biology, machine learning, engineering, statistics, biostatistics, biomedical engineering, cancer biology, immunology, genetics or related field, or Master’s with 3+ years experience, and a strong academic record.
Demonstrated impact in multi-disciplinary, team-driven scientific projects.
Expertise in programming in Python (including e.g. numpy, scipy, pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow). Additional experience in R is helpful but not required.
Expertise in analyzing complex, high-dimensional datasets using scientific and computational best practices to make novel scientific discoveries.
Strong publication record.
Scientific curiosity and interest in working in a dynamic, rapidly developing field.
Background in immunology/immuno-oncology and experience working with single-cell sequencing data is a plus.


Repertoire is committed towards social responsibility and developing an inclusive culture. Much as the power of the immune system lies in the diversity of T and B cells, we believe that our work requires the creativity and ingenuity of a diverse workforce, and we are committed to pursuing that in all facets of the work experience at Repertoire. We will continue to educate ourselves about the inequities and barriers present in our society and act as a company where we can make a difference.

Repertoire is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer.
