Through our expertise, mindset, culture and most importantly with your help we are turning the AI landscape upside down. Are you excited to contribute to meaningful, impactful projects?




Our proposition to you





We vouch to create a space where you can explore different sets of complex problems and data across industries and verticals.


To support you in your personal development, everyone at Kineo has a mentor. When you grow, so does Kineo.


Your decisions matter! You will not have a boss who decides things for you. At Kineo we believe that decisions are best made locally, by the people closest to the problem at hand.


Transparent salary and career planning from day one.


A beautiful office in the centre of Kreuzberg, with tons of benefits, such as free drinks, snacks, consoles etc.


28 days of vacation


A shared revenue model - when Kineo does well, you will benefit financially, too





Success in the role means that you will have





After 2 months: You established yourself as a member of the team and have already contributed to one of our client projects. You have a clear understanding of how we work and can independently navigate our technical architecture.


After 6 months: You are a key member of the team and fully involved in the development of a client project. You will have made notable contributions to our codebase and internal processes.


After 12-24 months: In collaboration with internal science and engineering resources, you lead the development of a client-facing application from the workshop phase to production. You are a trusted expert in a wide variety of machine learning algorithms and you are able to transfer that knowledge to more junior members of the team.





Your Character Traits





You want to achieve something and don't need a ""manager"" to tell you that. You are eager to have space to take responsibility and grow from that.


You enjoy exploring beyond your immediate tasks and are open to learning new skills. You collaborate across different areas to help the team succeed, even in areas outside your main expertise.


You are a strong communicator with the ability to present ideas clearly and collaborate effectively. You value building positive relationships and working together to achieve shared goals.





You fit in with our team culture if you





Enjoy working in an environment that combines pragmatic, commercial thinking with a strong desire to learn and grow together. We value team players that are curious but convey humility and respect for different opinions.


You actively choose to work in a start-up, with all the ups and downs.


See open feedback, accountability and independent thinking as the foundation for exceptional (team) work.


You embrace Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. You are excited to contribute to an environment where different perspectives are celebrated, and you actively participate in fostering awareness and continuous learning around DEI.



Tasks



You will work as part of smaller teams of 2-3 people on developing machine learning solutions with our clients.


You will conceptualize and implement algorithmic solutions to challenging business problems. This includes prototyping and productionizing of machine learning solutions, and also defining and analysing product use cases together with the customer.


You will own machine learning solutions from the first drop of raw data, all the way into production serving millions of inference requests.



Requirements



An advanced quantitative degree - e.g Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science or related fields. Strong knowledge of theoretical math and CS.


At least two years of work experience as Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.


Knowledge of working with large structured and unstructured data sets. Knowledge of data engineering tools like Apache Spark is an advantage.


Strong programming skills in Python. We love other languages too, but Python is what we (and you) will use.


We are AI Consultants - ask yourself: Do you want to be a Consultant?


Experience in using a wide range of ML frameworks such as SKLearn, Tensorflow, Torch in production. Experience with domain specific libraries like OpenCV, HuggingFace etc are an advantage.


Good written and verbal communication in both English and German. Most of our clients are German speaking so a level of at least B2 is required for the role.


Resident in Germany. Due to the size of the company, we cannot currently accept applications from other EU/non-EU countries.





We explicitly do not hire anyone who discriminates against people on the basis of religion, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status or other aspects. We encourage people from LGBTQIA+ and other underrepresented groups to apply.




Last but not least, keep in mind that we are hiring value based, not skill based. That being said, please tell us the following in your contact message:
