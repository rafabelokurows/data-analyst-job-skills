Work model:

This position is intended to be largely in-office with a focus on flexibility. Today, most of the global team is on a hybrid model ranging between 3-4 days in the office per week. We aim to find an inclusive balance between everyone's personal lives and responsibilities and the value created from in-office collaboration. We work with new team members to find that balance with them while building the trust and collaboration that our team values.

We believe that sharing the same physical space with our colleagues creates a level of trust and understanding that fosters innovation and a sense of purpose.

The socializing and relationships formed from these in-person interactions have created the bonds that make our team successful.

We not only want to encourage people to safely spend time in the office, but also, schedule regular travel between our offices in Europe and the US – and a regular conference where the entire worldwide team is gathered together. Maybe the Metaverse will replace the office some day – but it hasn't yet! Online meetings were a powerful connector during the pandemic – but they don't foster the same connection.

By applying, I confirm I have read and accepted TransPerfect's Privacy Policy: https://www.transperfect.com/about/data-privacy-recruiting




Work model:

This position is intended to be largely in-office with a focus on flexibility. Today, most of the global team is on a hybrid model ranging between 3-4 days in the office per week. We aim to find an inclusive balance between everyone's personal lives and responsibilities and the value created from in-office collaboration. We work with new team members to find that balance with them while building the trust and collaboration that our team values.

We believe that sharing the same physical space with our colleagues creates a level of trust and understanding that fosters innovation and a sense of purpose.

The socializing and relationships formed from these in-person interactions have created the bonds that make our team successful.

We not only want to encourage people to safely spend time in the office, but also, schedule regular travel between our offices in Europe and the US – and a regular conference where the entire worldwide team is gathered together. Maybe the Metaverse will replace the office some day – but it hasn't yet! Online meetings were a powerful connector during the pandemic – but they don't foster the same connection.

We work with new team members to find that balance with them while building the trust and collaboration that our team values.</em></p><p><em>We believe that sharing the same physical space with our colleagues creates a level of trust and understanding that fosters innovation and a sense of purpose.</em></p><p><em>The socializing and relationships formed from these in-person interactions have created the bonds that make our team successful.</em></p><p><em>We not only want to encourage people to safely spend time in the office, but also, schedule regular travel between our offices in Europe and the US – and a regular conference where the entire worldwide team is gathered together. Maybe the Metaverse will replace the office some day – but it hasn't yet! Online meetings were a powerful connector during the pandemic – but they don't foster the same connection.</em></p>

If you’re ready to join a growing company and make an immediate impact, we want to hear from you!




You will be joining at TransPerfect – TechOps:

The TransPerfect TechOps team has been a vital part of the company’s success since its formation over 10 years ago – delivering technology and services that have drastically simplified the lives of our clients and colleagues – from workflow improvements for colleagues to core services that form the basis of the company’s GlobalLink platform, to creating scalable client interfaces that allow novice users to navigate complex ecosystems.




https://globallink.transperfect.com/




When applying, please submit your CV in English.




Your responsibilities and tasks will include:

Implement defined features through code development, while also conducting thorough investigations and resolution of bugs
Develop modular, reusable code components to streamline development and maintenance
Utilize front-end frameworks like Vue.js, or Angular to create scalable and reusable UI components
Optimize code and assets to ensure optimal load times and smooth performance
Perform code reviews to uphold quality standards
Collaborate within cross-functional teams to deliver solutions that either adhere to existing standards or establish new ones across departments
Within an agile framework, you'll manage internal and external implementation requirements and expectations through clear communication and effective oversight
Provide constructive feedback to the technical staff during all phases of the software lifecycle to keep development priorities aligned with business needs
Take ownership and drive end-to-end quality software development processes

2-4 years of software development experience
Proficiency in JavaScript
Proven experience working with frontend frameworks such as Vue.js/React/Angular (or similar) and related tools and libraries

Experience/knowledge of Agile methodologies like SCRUM/Kanban
Knowledge of SOLID principles
Knowledge of clean code practices
Ability to work with complex enterprise software architectures
Excellent communication and collaboration skills with a proven ability to work effectively in a team environment




By applying, I confirm I have read and accepted TransPerfect's Privacy Policy: https://www.transperfect.com/about/data-privacy-recruiting




Work model:

This position is intended to be largely in-office with a focus on flexibility. Today, most of the global team is on a hybrid model ranging between 3-4 days in the office per week. We aim to find an inclusive balance between everyone's personal lives and responsibilities and the value created from in-office collaboration. We work with new team members to find that balance with them while building the trust and collaboration that our team values.

We believe that sharing the same physical space with our colleagues creates a level of trust and understanding that fosters innovation and a sense of purpose.

The socializing and relationships formed from these in-person interactions have created the bonds that make our team successful.

We not only want to encourage people to safely spend time in the office, but also, schedule regular travel between our offices in Europe and the US – and a regular conference where the entire worldwide team is gathered together. Maybe the Metaverse will replace the office some day – but it hasn't yet! Online meetings were a powerful connector during the pandemic – but they don't foster the same connection.

About The Role

We approach Data Science at Revolut the same way that we approach everything else – with class, logical thinking and lots of style 😎 Let’s break it down: we take the most complex problems and create tailor-made solutions for our customers 🚀 If you’re thinking the Data team is kept in some sort of a secret den, doomed to never see the impact of their work, don’t worry - that’s not how we do things. They’re some of our best and brightest problem-solvers, deployed to the front lines to work in product teams and deliver rockstar solutions 🤘

We start with deep data analysis to understand our customers, their objectives and any issues they might have. We then use various data points and advanced machine learning algorithms, to come up with the best possible option for each client. We experiment, iterate and build fully automated solutions, based on algorithms which self-improve with time.

We’re looking for next-level Data Scientists to board our FinTech rocket ship and shape the future of financial services apps. Phew! It’s a big task, but you won’t do it alone. 💪

People who love building great products, redefining success, and turning the complexity of a chaotic world into the simplicity of a beautiful solution.

About The Role

Our Technology team isn’t just one of the best in the industry. It's one of the best in the world. And we’re proud of it. It’s our driving force — our engine.

From building a new financial backend to creating an innovative app, there’s nothing they can’t do. Our Technology team isn’t here to fix legacy systems — it’s here to build world-class financial features from the ground up that'll be used by millions of people around the world.

At Revolut, we pride ourselves on how truly data-driven every department of the company is. Data platform engineers are the enablers of this data-centric culture, providing the infrastructure and tools that power insight generation and decision-making for everyone, from entry-level analysts to C-level executives.

Partnering with cross-functional teams (product, engineering, data science, analytics) to build and enhance a seamless data platform, translating abstract concepts into practical solutions
Establishing and enforcing data standards, maintaining comprehensive documentation, and managing a company-wide data registry
Training and supporting users, and communicating platform updates and insights through various channels (dashboards, bots, etc.)
Planning and executing organisation-wide platform changes, ensuring consistent best practices for coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance
Leveraging data to guide all aspects of engineering work, ensuring insight-driven outcomes


What You'll Need

Extensive experience working with distributed data processing and query engines (e.g., Trino, Spark, Snowflake, BigQuery)


Nice to have


Proven experience building large-scale infrastructure applications and writing maintainable code in multiple programming languages
Expertise in cloud (GCP, AWS), containerisation, and infrastructure-as-code (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform)
Experience building data platforms using Spark, Trino, Presto, Flink, or similar, with a focus on data quality, SQL performance tuning, and data warehousing principles
Understanding of modern data architecture with experience implementing data mesh principles
Familiarity with notebook-based data science workflows and proficiency in using monitoring and logging tools (NewRelic, Grafana, Prometheus, ELK).


Building a global financial super app isn’t enough. Our Revoluters are a priority, and that’s why in 2021 we launched our inaugural D&I Framework, designed to help us thrive and grow everyday. We're not just doing this because it's the right thing to do. We’re doing it because we know that seeking out diverse talent and creating an inclusive workplace is the way to create exceptional, innovative products and services for our customers.

People deserve more from their money. More visibility, more control, and more freedom. Since 2015, Revolut has been on a mission to deliver just that. Our powerhouse of products — including spending, saving, investing, exchanging, travelling, and more — help our 50+ million customers get more from their money every day.

As we continue our lightning-fast growth,‌ 2 things are essential to our success: our people and our culture. In recognition of our outstanding employee experience, we've been certified as a Great Place to Work™. So far, we have 10,000+ people working around the world, from our offices and remotely, to help us achieve our mission. And we're looking for more brilliant people. People who love building great products, redefining success, and turning the complexity of a chaotic world into the simplicity of a beautiful solution.

About The Role

Our Technology team isn’t just one of the best in the industry. It's one of the best in the world. And we’re proud of it. It’s our driving force — our engine 🚀

From building a new financial backend to creating an innovative app, there’s nothing they can’t do. Our Technology team isn’t here to fix legacy systems — it’s here to build world-class financial features from the ground up that'll be used by millions of people around the world 🌎

You may expect our Python Engineers to work on heavily regulated financial systems, but we love the unexpected. We’re better known internally for writing high-quality code and building complex novel solutions end-to-end.

These geniuses have created our chatbot — the lovely Rita — and they didn’t stop there. They also created automated financial crime quality controls in just a few weeks. They’re that good.

You’ll never work alone, either. As a Python Engineer, you’ll sit within a Product Team simultaneously working with Data Scientists, Analysts, Engineers, Product Owners, and Operations Managers to solve problems and make our rocket ship fly even higher.

What You’ll Be Doing


Building APIs, making sure they're properly designed and scaled according to business needs
Creating data pipelines to pull data from production services into our data warehouse, powering reporting, data analytics, and data science
Writing event consumers to build new data models for new flows and processes


What You'll Need


5+ years of experience working as a Software Engineer
3+ years of experience engineering with Python as your primary language
An academic background in STEM
Fluency in Python, SQL, and other OOPLs
Experience with API development and integration
A practical understanding of distributed systems
The ability to write concurrent code in IO/CPU bound situations
Experience with Docker, K8s, Ansible, Teamcity, monitoring, and alerting


Nice to have


Experience with prototyping and sketching
Multiple side projects or open source contributions
Exposure to GCP
Experience with Django Framework


Building a global financial super app isn’t enough. Our Revoluters are a priority, and that’s why in 2021 we launched our inaugural D&I Framework, designed to help us thrive and grow everyday. We're not just doing this because it's the right thing to do. We’re doing it because we know that seeking out diverse talent and creating an inclusive workplace is the way to create exceptional, innovative products and services for our customers. That’s why we encourage applications from people with diverse backgrounds and experiences to join this multicultural, hard-working team.

Additional Information

Early morning. Campo 24 de Agosto. In 4 minutes, you are clocking in at the office. After grabbing a cup of coffee and fresh fruit, pick up your laptop and choose your spot for the day. It's going to be a busy one: French class before lunch and, just after, quick medical appointment at Natixis doctor's office. Lunch break. Outside in the big terrace (look at your crops at the Urban Garden; ready to harvest!) or, if you feel like stretching your legs, walk downtown to grab lunch.

Back inside. Quick sprint review (working together anywhere means virtual happy birthday to that colleague in Paris that just turned 35). The afternoon went flying (tasks, reports, calls, some jokes with your teammates). End it on a high note: just one PlayStation game or the final match for that ping-pong tournament.

Tomorrow, you complete that certified technical training and the day after, you will work from home, taking advantage to finally do that online course on Udemy. Once you are done with your tasks for the day, you can visit the office for a board games session or show up at the rehearsal of one of Natixis bands. If that is too steady for you, meet your colleagues to surf some waves or join them in a football match.

Outside in the big terrace (look at your crops at the Urban Garden; ready to harvest!) or, if you feel like stretching your legs, walk downtown to grab lunch.<br><br>Back inside. Quick sprint review (working together anywhere means virtual happy birthday to that colleague in Paris that just turned 35).

Once you are done with your tasks for the day, you can visit the office for a board games session or show up at the rehearsal of one of Natixis bands. If that is too steady for you, meet your colleagues to surf some waves or join them in a football match.

#MuchMoreThanJustAJob

Early morning. Campo 24 de Agosto. In 4 minutes, you are clocking in at the office. Start your day having breakfast with the Team and grab fresh fruit on the way to your seat, in one of Porto’s most typical neighborhoods. This Purple Day is going to be a busy one: daily meeting ensuring all team members are on the same page regarding work status, priorities and blockers, language class and, just after, a Talent Management meeting with your manager, discussing your career path.

Lunch break. Today, your Team is onboarding newcomers, but also welcoming French colleagues: the perfect excuse to walk downtown and bond over a francesinha. When returning, inhale nature and peace of mind in Natixis Urban Garden (look at the crops; ready to harvest!).

Back inside. Brainstorming session on a new, exciting project in our disruptive and immersive Manaus Village. The afternoon went flying (tasks, meetings, some jokes with your teammates). End it on a high note: celebrating cultural diversity with a Diwali, the Indian festival of lights.

Tomorrow, you attend a conference led by influential speakers in your industry and, the day after, you will work from home, benefitting from some focus time to complete that report and soft skills course on LinkedIn Learning. Once you are done with your work for the day, strike the right note playing with Natixis band or be part of a board games session. If that is too steady for you, meet your colleagues to catch some waves or sail the Douro river during golden hour
