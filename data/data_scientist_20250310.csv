More than 40% of all fresh produce is wasted in the US, which accounts for over 17 billion dollars in lost product annually and contributes more carbon dioxide emissions than all of US transportation combined. Globally, food that is never consumed accounts for 7% of the global freshwater supply and 308MM hectares of land. Our goal is to reduce these drastic numbers by making the produce supply chain smarter through data-driven decisions.




Strella uses proprietary sensors to predict shelf life in the food supply chain. We use this information to reduce food waste and help deliver better quality produce to consumers. We have been commercialized for 5 years and are currently in our growth stage.




Role

We are looking for an ambitious data scientist with 3+ years of experience to help us build the next generation of our modeling and prediction engine. The applicant must have a strong focus on delivering action-based results that can help customers make better decisions using data. Experience in agriculture is a plus. 




As a startup, we seek applicants who are self-starters and can wear multiple hats. We are in a rapid growth stage and are looking for people who thrive in a fast-paced environment while maintaining quality. This is an in-person role in either our Seattle or Wenatchee WA office.




Responsibilities

​Partner with developers, product managers, and business partners to frame problems mathematically and in the right business context
Perform exploratory data analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the problem
Construct and fit statistical, machine learning, or optimization models
Implement advanced analytics techniques to identify key factors impacting the quality and shelf life of fruits
Develop predictive models and machine-learning algorithms to predict the shelf life of different types of fruits
Design experimentation strategies for evaluating our models
Collaborate with developers to implement algorithms in production
Analyze experimental and observational data; communicate findings; facilitate launch decisions




Skills




Bachelors, M.S. or Ph.D. in Machine Learning, Statistics, Operations Research, Optimization, Computer Science, or other quantitative fields or related work experience
3+ years of professional experience, startup experience required
Proficiency in causal inference, experimentation, signal processing, and/or machine learning
Proficiency with Python and working in a production coding environment
Passion for solving unstructured and non-standard mathematical problems

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Credit Intelligence brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s credit risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. Getting this tradeoff right is critical to Stripe’s long term success and profitability. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from credit losses that can put our financial position at risk.

The Credit Intelligence team consists of machine learning, backend, and full stack engineers who want to tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We are undertaking several new efforts, where you can have an outsized impact on the architecture, implementation, and design choices behind these systems.

What you’ll do


Design and deploy new models to iteratively improve Stripe’s business-critical models and systems that understand a user’s credit risk
Build the next generation of model training and scoring infrastructure, in close collaboration with our infrastructure teams
Imagine new feature ideas and design data pipelines to incorporate them into our models
Improve the way we evaluate and monitor our model and system performance



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


An advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. computer science, stats, physics, engineering)
3+ years experience in software engineering in a production environment
Experience designing and training machine learning models to solve critical business problems
Knowledge about how to manipulate data to perform analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to evaluate a hypothesis



Preferred Qualifications


The ability to thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts
Pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $180,000 - $270,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

As an early member of our Data Science and Analytics team, you will play an instrumental role in our company's mission of building safe and beneficial artificial intelligence by driving marketing effectiveness through data-driven insights and analytics. In this unique company, technology, and moment in history, your work will be critical to informing our marketing strategy and optimizing our go-to-market approach as we deploy safe, frontier AI at scale to the world.

You will work closely with marketing, product, and commercial teams to define and measure key marketing success metrics, analyze customer acquisition and retention, and build a culture of developing and testing hypotheses through experimentation. You've worked in cultures of excellence in the past, and are eager to apply that experience to building robust and scalable marketing analytics systems and processes as our company goes through a phase of rapid growth.

Responsibilities


Deep dive into marketing performance data to provide insights to marketing leaders and influence the company's marketing strategy
Define core marketing metrics that measure the team's success. Set goals, monitor performance, and develop actionable reporting for campaigns and channels
Identify and size opportunities to improve marketing effectiveness, influencing marketing roadmap through your insights and recommendations on audience targeting, channel optimization, and messaging effectiveness
Develop hypotheses on marketing initiatives, design controlled experiments, analyze the results, and make recommendations based on impact to key metrics
Develop a unified view of customer behavior across products through deeper analysis
Build a data-driven marketing culture from the ground up by establishing foundational marketing analytics best practices and making marketing data more accessible across the company


You may be a good fit if you have:


6+ years of experience in data science or analytics roles, preferably in a marketing or customer acquisition context
3+ years of experience deeply embedding in Marketing teams, turning marketing data into concise and insightful analysis that drives business outcomes
A passion for the company's mission of building helpful, honest, and harmless AI

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$265,000 — $315,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

As an early member of our Data Science and Analytics team, you will play an instrumental role in our company's mission of building safe and beneficial artificial intelligence by driving marketing effectiveness through data-driven insights and analytics. In this unique company, technology, and moment in history, your work will be critical to informing our marketing strategy and optimizing our go-to-market approach as we deploy safe, frontier AI at scale to the world.

You will work closely with marketing, product, and commercial teams to define and measure key marketing success metrics, analyze customer acquisition and retention, and build a culture of developing and testing hypotheses through experimentation. You've worked in cultures of excellence in the past, and are eager to apply that experience to building robust and scalable marketing analytics systems and processes as our company goes through a phase of rapid growth.

Responsibilities


Deep dive into marketing performance data to provide insights to marketing leaders and influence the company's marketing strategy
Define core marketing metrics that measure the team's success. Set goals, monitor performance, and develop actionable reporting for campaigns and channels
Identify and size opportunities to improve marketing effectiveness, influencing marketing roadmap through your insights and recommendations on audience targeting, channel optimization, and messaging effectiveness
Develop hypotheses on marketing initiatives, design controlled experiments, analyze the results, and make recommendations based on impact to key metrics
Develop a unified view of customer behavior across products through deeper analysis
Build a data-driven marketing culture from the ground up by establishing foundational marketing analytics best practices and making marketing data more accessible across the company


You may be a good fit if you have:


6+ years of experience in data science or analytics roles, preferably in a marketing or customer acquisition context
3+ years of experience deeply embedding in Marketing teams, turning marketing data into concise and insightful analysis that drives business outcomes
A passion for the company's mission of building helpful, honest, and harmless AI
Expertise in Python, SQL, and marketing analytics platforms and visualization tools
Experience with marketing attribution models across a variety of channels (SEO, Paid Search, Social, etc.) and A/B testing frameworks
Familiarity with both B2C and B2B/Enterprise marketing analytics
A bias for action and urgency, not letting perfect be the enemy of the effective
A strong disposition to thrive in ambiguity, taking initiative to create clarity and forward progress
A deep curiosity and energy for pulling the thread on hard questions about customer behavior and marketing performance
Highly effective written communication and presentation skills, with ability to translate complex analyses into actionable marketing insights


Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$265,000 — $315,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. Truth-seeking is one of Notion’s values, and it lies at the heart of the product data science team’s foundation. Data scientists on this team work closely with engineering teams to transform data into evidence that can direct product decisions.

As an early member of the product data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how product, engineering, and data science work together, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.

What You'll Achieve


You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)

Lila Sciences is a privately held, early-stage technology company pioneering the application of artificial intelligence to transform every aspect of the scientific method. Lila Sciences is backed by Flagship Pioneering, which brings the courage, long-term vision, and resources needed to realize unreasonable results. Join our mission-driven team and contribute to the future of science.

We are leveraging AI across both Life Sciences and Physical Sciences to transform the process of invention and discovery,

At Lila Sciences, we are uniquely cross-functional and collaborative. We are actively reimagining the way teams work together and communicate. Therefore, we seek individuals with an inclusive mindset and a diversity of thought. Our teams thrive in unstructured and creative environments. All voices are heard because we know that experience comes in many forms, skills are transferable, and passion goes a long way.

If this sounds like an environment you’d love to work in, even if you only have some of the experience listed below, please apply.

The Role

Lila Sciences is seeking experienced, creative, and talented Machine Learning Researchers (Open-Endedness) across Scientist, Senior Scientist, and Principal Scientist levels to join our team. Title will be determined by merit and experience level. 

Open-Endedness is an emerging area of machine learning that aims to automate never-ending innovative processes of discovery and exploration. The Open-Endedness Team, led by Ken Stanley, investigates in particular how a continual chain of deep transformative creativity can be maintained that far exceeds the derivative creativity seen in current models. In effect, the systems developed on this team will go beyond simply solving problems posed by users, to conceiving the future unimagined directions of science itself.

To realize this vision, we’re seeking a broad tapestry of ML expertise to facilitate daring and unconventional investigations, including but not exclusive to pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF, distillation, mechanistic interpretability, and quality diversity (QD) techniques.

Candidates should have experience and/or interest in some or all of:


Designing, implementing, and modifying generative models (e.g., LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal models) through unconventional pipelines to achieve unconventional behaviors
Unconventional evaluation techniques, including subjective evaluation and the evaluation of interestingness
Creative approaches to investigating, understanding, and visualizing the internal representations of large models, encompassing mechanistic interpretability but also going in new directions beyond it
Quality diversity (QD) algorithms like MAP-Elites, novelty search with local competition, POET, OMNI, minimal criterion novelty search, etc., with LLMs or other large models potentially being updated on the inner loop.


Qualifications:


PhD in quantitative disciplines ideal, but will consider self-taught researchers with exceptional achievements
Publications in relevant conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, ICLR, GECCO, ICCC
Expertise in ML frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Jax); and/or QD algorithm implementation; and/or neuroevolution algorithm implementation
Experience in training and deploying ML models on distributed computing services (g. AWS/GCP/Azure, or clusters).


Working at Lila, you would have access to advanced technology in the areas of:


AI experimental design and simulation
Automated custom instrumentation
Generative molecular and material design

Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

Diversity & Inclusion

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article.

          <strong>Why Now<br><br></strong>At <strong>Structured</strong>, we’re redefining how developers build and deploy data apps by consolidating the entire analytics stack into code. While AI tools like Copilot have made writing code faster, integrating <strong>AI-powered intelligence into data applications is still complex and inefficient</strong>. Trends like <strong>local-first AI, in-process data querying, and real-time inference</strong> are reshaping how modern apps are built: faster iteration, lower latency, and simpler infrastructure.<br><br><strong>Structured</strong> builds on these shifts with a lightweight SDK that lets developers <strong>prototype, deploy, and manage AI-powered data applications (dashboards, internal tools, decision engines) in hours instead of weeks</strong>.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Credit Intelligence brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s credit risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. Getting this tradeoff right is critical to Stripe’s long term success and profitability. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from credit losses that can put our financial position at risk.

The Credit Intelligence team consists of machine learning, backend, and full stack engineers who want to tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We are undertaking several new efforts, where you can have an outsized impact on the architecture, implementation, and design choices behind these systems.

What you’ll do


Design and deploy new models to iteratively improve Stripe’s business-critical models and systems that understand a user’s credit risk
Build the next generation of model training and scoring infrastructure, in close collaboration with our infrastructure teams
Imagine new feature ideas and design data pipelines to incorporate them into our models
Improve the way we evaluate and monitor our model and system performance



Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


An advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. computer science, stats, physics, engineering)
3+ years experience in software engineering in a production environment
Experience designing and training machine learning models to solve critical business problems
Knowledge about how to manipulate data to perform analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to evaluate a hypothesis



Preferred Qualifications


The ability to thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts
Pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $180,000 - $270,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

Getting this tradeoff right is critical to Stripe’s long term success and profitability. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from credit losses that can put our financial position at risk.<br><br>The Credit Intelligence team consists of machine learning, backend, and full stack engineers who want to tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We are undertaking several new efforts, where you can have an outsized impact on the architecture, implementation, and design choices behind these systems.<br><br>What you’ll do<br><br><ul><li>Design and deploy new models to iteratively improve Stripe’s business-critical models and systems that understand a user’s credit risk</li><li>Build the next generation of model training and scoring infrastructure, in close collaboration with our infrastructure teams</li><li>Imagine new feature ideas and design data pipelines to incorporate them into our models</li><li>Improve the way we evaluate and monitor our model and system performance<br><br><br></li></ul>Who you are<br><br>We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.<br><br><strong>Minimum Requirements<br><br></strong><ul><li>An advanced degree in a quantitative field (e.g. computer science, stats, physics, engineering)</li><li>3+ years experience in software engineering in a production environment</li><li>Experience designing and training machine learning models to solve critical business problems</li><li>Knowledge about how to manipulate data to perform analysis, including querying data, defining metrics, or slicing and dicing data to evaluate a hypothesis<br><br><br></li></ul><strong>Preferred Qualifications<br><br></strong><ul><li>The ability to thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts</li><li>Pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems<br><br><br></li></ul>Hybrid work at Stripe<br><br>This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).<br><br>Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.<br><br>A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location.

For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.<br><br>Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

We are looking for an ML Engineer to join our small but nimble AI team whose mission is to make Notion an ML-powered product. As an ML Engineer, you will work on incorporating large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and other AI technologies into Notion’s product in a high quality way. You’ll be exploring the boundaries of what’s possible with ML technology and finding innovative ways to apply new industry learnings to Notion’s offering.

What You'll Achieve


Work with the team to prototype and experiment with AI model quality improvements, either by fine tuning, prompt engineering, or building new models when needed
Productionize and launch new AI technology integrations into Notion’s core product
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver product features on time
Stay up-to-date with the latest AI technologies and trends



Skills You'll Need To Bring


Domain Expert, Teacher and Learner: You have experience building AI products using LLMs, embeddings or other ML natural language technologies. 3+ years of experience in one or more of the following areas: machine learning, recommendation or ranking systems, natural language understanding/generation or artificial intelligence. You’re excited about bringing your pre-existing knowledge to the team, but you balance that with perpetual curiosity and understanding that there is always more to learn.
Holistic Problem Solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
Communicate with Care: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
Impact Driven: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals.



Nice To Haves


You understand how parts of a system fit together, from the user interface to the data model. You are familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
You’re proficient with data pipeline technologies: Spark, DBT, etc
You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or literature.



We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

The company was founded on the belief that understanding the repertoire of T cell receptor (TCR)-antigen immune synapses that maintain health and drive disease represents one of the greatest opportunities for innovation in medical science. Repertoire scientists created and developed the DECODETM platform, which allows in-depth characterization of TCR-antigen pairs, and the ability to deploy this information in the form of novel targeted immune medicines to fundamentally reprogram the immune system to kill tumors or induce immune homeostasis.

From its sites in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Zurich, Switzerland, Repertoire’s team is advancing a pipeline of DECODE-enabled immune medicines. For cancer, we are developing a pipeline of TCR bispecifics molecules for treatment of multiple cancer types. In addition, we are developing a pipeline of mRNA tolerizing vaccines for treatment of autoimmune diseases.

Repertoire was founded by Flagship Pioneering and is supported by a strong investor base. In addition, the company recently entered a strategic partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop tolerizing vaccines for up to three autoimmune diseases.

Role Overview

Repertoire Immune Medicines is seeking a Data Scientist to join the Computational Science team to enable the discovery of new insights from our extensive and growing immune synapse database. The successful candidate will work at the interface of computational biology, data science, machine learning, and statistics with broad impact across early discovery, candidate development, and biomarker discovery.

Key Responsibilities


Develop, evaluate, and implement rigorous analytical models and methods as needed for scientific discovery and development.
Assist in the conception, development, optimization, and assessment of machine-learning models for understanding the T-cell receptor-peptide-MHC interface.
Work alongside computer science engineers, wet-lab scientists, and project managers, contributing to early discovery, lead identification, lead optimization, and biomarker development.
Maintain familiarity with scientific literature to assist in the development and benchmarking of new methods.
Communicate findings both internally and externally via presentations and publication.


Qualifications/Experience


PhD in computational biology, machine learning, engineering, statistics, biostatistics, biomedical engineering, cancer biology, immunology, genetics or related field, or Master’s with 3+ years experience, and a strong academic record.
Demonstrated impact in multi-disciplinary, team-driven scientific projects.
Expertise in programming in Python (including e.g. numpy, scipy, pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow). Additional experience in R is helpful but not required.
Expertise in analyzing complex, high-dimensional datasets using scientific and computational best practices to make novel scientific discoveries.
Strong publication record.
Scientific curiosity and interest in working in a dynamic, rapidly developing field.
Background in immunology/immuno-oncology and experience working with single-cell sequencing data is a plus.


Repertoire is committed towards social responsibility and developing an inclusive culture. Much as the power of the immune system lies in the diversity of T and B cells, we believe that our work requires the creativity and ingenuity of a diverse workforce, and we are committed to pursuing that in all facets of the work experience at Repertoire. We will continue to educate ourselves about the inequities and barriers present in our society and act as a company where we can make a difference.

Repertoire is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

The company was founded on the belief that understanding the repertoire of T cell receptor (TCR)-antigen immune synapses that maintain health and drive disease represents one of the greatest opportunities for innovation in medical science. Repertoire scientists created and developed the DECODETM platform, which allows in-depth characterization of TCR-antigen pairs, and the ability to deploy this information in the form of novel targeted immune medicines to fundamentally reprogram the immune system to kill tumors or induce immune homeostasis.

From its sites in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Zurich, Switzerland, Repertoire’s team is advancing a pipeline of DECODE-enabled immune medicines. For cancer, we are developing a pipeline of TCR bispecifics molecules for treatment of multiple cancer types. In addition, we are developing a pipeline of mRNA tolerizing vaccines for treatment of autoimmune diseases.

Repertoire was founded by Flagship Pioneering and is supported by a strong investor base. In addition, the company recently entered a strategic partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop tolerizing vaccines for up to three autoimmune diseases.

Role Overview

Repertoire Immune Medicines is seeking a Data Scientist to join the Computational Science team to enable the discovery of new insights from our extensive and growing immune synapse database. The successful candidate will work at the interface of computational biology, data science, machine learning, and statistics with broad impact across early discovery, candidate development, and biomarker discovery.

Key Responsibilities


Develop, evaluate, and implement rigorous analytical models and methods as needed for scientific discovery and development.
Assist in the conception, development, optimization, and assessment of machine-learning models for understanding the T-cell receptor-peptide-MHC interface.
Work alongside computer science engineers, wet-lab scientists, and project managers, contributing to early discovery, lead identification, lead optimization, and biomarker development.
Maintain familiarity with scientific literature to assist in the development and benchmarking of new methods.
Communicate findings both internally and externally via presentations and publication.


Qualifications/Experience


PhD in computational biology, machine learning, engineering, statistics, biostatistics, biomedical engineering, cancer biology, immunology, genetics or related field, or Master’s with 3+ years experience, and a strong academic record.
Demonstrated impact in multi-disciplinary, team-driven scientific projects.
Expertise in programming in Python (including e.g. numpy, scipy, pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow). Additional experience in R is helpful but not required.
Expertise in analyzing complex, high-dimensional datasets using scientific and computational best practices to make novel scientific discoveries.
Strong publication record.
Scientific curiosity and interest in working in a dynamic, rapidly developing field.
Background in immunology/immuno-oncology and experience working with single-cell sequencing data is a plus.


Repertoire is committed towards social responsibility and developing an inclusive culture. Much as the power of the immune system lies in the diversity of T and B cells, we believe that our work requires the creativity and ingenuity of a diverse workforce, and we are committed to pursuing that in all facets of the work experience at Repertoire. We will continue to educate ourselves about the inequities and barriers present in our society and act as a company where we can make a difference.

Repertoire is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer.
