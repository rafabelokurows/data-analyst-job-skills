That’s where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Data Scientist (d/f/m) at Aignostics, you work on interdisciplinary projects to push the state of the art of machine learning for digital pathology. Together with your colleagues you apply state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to solve complex real-world problems. You independently conduct rigorous experiments while also contributing well-designed features to our codebase.

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ data scientists, software developers, biologists, and pathologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments.

Job Description

Omio is building the future of travel pricing. We’re moving from manual, rule-based systems to AI-driven dynamic pricing to enhance revenue, efficiency, and competitiveness. As we transition, we’re looking for someone who can both build cutting-edge solutions and champion this shift within the company.

Pilot AI Solutions: Design and implement a Proof of Concept (PoC) for dynamic pricing in a test market.
Evangelize AI Pricing: Advocate for the adoption of AI-driven pricing by demonstrating its value to key stakeholders across the business.
Analyse Large Data: Leverage Omio’s data and external factors (like competitor pricing) to optimize pricing decisions.

Experience in building production-ready AI systems from scratch is a big plus


Knowledge & Skills

Experience of building low-latency / near real-time processing systems.

To support you in your personal development, everyone at Kineo has a mentor. When you grow, so does Kineo.


Your decisions matter! You will not have a boss who decides things for you. At Kineo we believe that decisions are best made locally, by the people closest to the problem at hand.


Transparent salary and career planning from day one.


A beautiful office in the centre of Kreuzberg, with tons of benefits, such as free drinks, snacks, consoles etc.

Experience in using a wide range of ML frameworks such as SKLearn, Tensorflow, Torch in production. Experience with domain specific libraries like OpenCV, HuggingFace etc are an advantage.


Good written and verbal communication in both English and German. Most of our clients are German speaking so a level of at least B2 is required for the role.


Resident in Germany. Due to the size of the company, we cannot currently accept applications from other EU/non-EU countries.





We explicitly do not hire anyone who discriminates against people on the basis of religion, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status or other aspects. We encourage people from LGBTQIA+ and other underrepresented groups to apply.




Last but not least, keep in mind that we are hiring value based, not skill based. That being said, please tell us the following in your contact message:

We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize how cancer and other complex diseases are diagnosed and treated. We also believe that AI is a tool, not an identity – without access to high-quality data and a scientifically rigorous, transparent approach to model development, AI is just a buzzword. That's where we come in.

Aignostics is a spin-off from one of Europe's largest and most prestigious university hospitals (Charité), with employees in Berlin and New York. We have received over $50M in funding from leading investors and are a growing team of over 100 interdisciplinary professionals. We work with academic partners as well as leading global life sciences companies.

As a Staff Machine Learning Research Scientist at Aignostics, you will play a crucial role in shaping the scientific and technical direction and integrity of our data science platform, projects, and products. You will work hand in hand with our collaborators in academia and industry to push the state of the art for digital pathology. Your expertise will be instrumental in driving scientific and technical excellence across all data science teams, ensuring we deliver high-quality, scalable solutions that transform complex biomedical data into actionable insights for cancer research and diagnostics..

This is a unique opportunity to join a fun, diverse, and growing team of 100+ machine learners, software engineers, applied scientists, pathologists, and biologists to shape the next generation of cancer treatments. You will be part of a driven community that works in an agile, supportive, and interdisciplinary research environment where your results make a difference to patients. In our established startup, you have the opportunity to grow personally and technically, take on significant responsibilities, and benefit from a dynamic work environment.

Data Science or Machine Learning? We do both at Aignostics, and are convinced that both are needed for success. You can expect to work on a broad spectrum of topics from deep learning with foundation and other state-of-the-art models on terabytes of data to projects in low sample regimes and very high-dimensional and multimodal data. We have nearly all the data science challenges you can think of for you!

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees.

You translate biomedical challenges into concrete machine learning research roadmaps and coordinate their execution. Together with your colleagues you develop elegant solutions to complex problems, conduct rigorous experiments and finally convince your stakeholders with crystal clear presentations.

At Aignostics, we believe that fighting cancer is a job for people of all identities, backgrounds, and cultures. We value and celebrate diversity and inclusion and are committed to offering equal employment and promotion opportunities for all applicants and employees. Applicants will be considered regardless of their age, disability, ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We thrive through collaboration and believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

Information about the position

As a Decision Scientist at Vinted, your work will have a tangible impact on the real world, empowering Vinted’s members to lead more sustainable lives. You will play a key role in shaping our product and business strategy by leveraging data to drive impactful decision-making.

Decision Scientists at Vinted are distributed across our family of domains: Strategy & Planning, Marketing, Member Lifecycle, Buyer, Seller, Pricing & Revenue, Purchase, Order, Payments, Trust & Safety, Security and Help Experience, either embedded in cross-functional product teams or as part of data teams, collaborating closely with colleagues to identify opportunities, generate insights, and improve member experiences.

This role is ideal for someone who thrives in a fast-paced environment, enjoys problem-solving, and is passionate about using data to drive meaningful change.

Our Decision Scientists work within the broader Data Science & Analytics (DSA) organisation, where we have three distinct roles. We believe that each role can make a similarly sized business impact in different ways, and therefore, our salary ranges are the same for all three roles.

Decision Scientists are responsible for actionable insights, identifying and sizing opportunities, and developing automated tools that increase the quality of product and business decisions by applying statistical methods and data-driven decision-making.

Data Scientists are responsible for identification of algorithmic opportunities, ensuring those opportunities are addressed in an optimal fashion and design, development and maintenance of production-grade statistical and machine learning algorithms.

Analytics Engineers are responsible for data curation – translating data needs from stakeholders into architecting, building and maintaining efficient & reliable data models and pipelines.

As a Decision Scientist at Vinted, you’ll:


Partner with your team and stakeholders at Vinted, to identify strategic opportunities and provide data-driven recommendations, as well as answer critical business questions.
Test and analyse developed opportunities to validate their value and understand their business impact, using statistical methods and visualisation tools
Select, calculate, and monitor your team's key performance indicators, proactively flagging issues, running analyses and understanding root causes
Enable your team and direct stakeholders to independently leverage data for business insights via self-service dashboards
Contribute to a data-driven culture by promoting best practices in analytics and decision-making to make data count.


About You


Experience in a Decision Science or Data Analytics role.
Good analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, with the ability to balance depth of analysis with business impact.
Familiarity with SQL and Python
Experience with BI tools (e.g., Looker, Tableau, Power BI)
Knowledge of statistical methods, such as A/B testing, regression analysis, and other inferential techniques.
Highly results-oriented and comfortable with iterative processes
Strong communicator who can convincingly present results to both technical and non-technical audiences
Fluent in English, both written and spoken


If you’re excited about this role but don’t meet every requirement, we still encourage you to apply. We have multiple positions available across our different domains - your unique experience and perspective could be exactly what we need!

At Briink, we're helping accelerate the transition to a sustainable future by creating the next-generation of AI powered tools for sustainability advisory, audit, and certification teams.

We believe that AI is the key to unlocking the future of sustainable business. With over 50 enterprise clients—including some of the world's largest firms—we’re already transforming how organizations manage their ESG data. Our technology helps sustainability teams uncover actionable insights from unstructured data sources, making it easier to drive compliance, efficiency, and impact at scale.

Backed by €7 million in capital, including a freshly closed round, and supported by leading venture capital funds, Briink is at the forefront of ESG innovation. We’re based at the heart of Europe’s AI revolution—the AI Campus in Berlin—where we are building a future where AI helps accelerate the transition to a sustainable future.

Your role

As Briink’s AI/LLM Engineer, you will work as part of the product and engineering team to bring the cutting edge of LLMs to sustainable finance and help advance Briink’s mission to use AI to help accelerate transition to a sustainable economy. This includes both using your knowledge and experience as an AI practitioner to evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM engine, as well as explore new use-cases for LLMs in ESG and sustainability.


Systematically evaluate and improve our core LLM systems: You will use your knowledge and experience as an AI/LLM practitioner to systematically evaluate and improve our core ESG AI/LLM system and help ensure Briink becomes a world leader for ESG domain specific LLM tools.
Build LLMs into production grade services: On a scale with pure researcher on one side and traditional backend software development on the other side, this leans somewhat more on the software engineering side of the scale, as part of your role will also be to help ensure that improvements to the AI/LLM services are driven through to production and delivering tangible value to our users.
Explore new LLM use-cases in ESG: Both LLMs are ESG are moving very fast and so at Briink we value curiosity and exploring AI could be applied to new use cases in ESG. Part of your role therefore will be to explore and prototype new ways LLMs could support our users and solve new problems for ESG teams.
Be a core member of the product and engineering team: Briink is a collaborative team and we really enjoy working together to try and build Briink into a successful company that has mission impact at scale. You will therefore work closely as part of a cross discipline team to make sure all the work we do pushes in the same direction an helps achieve our mission.

Practical knowledge of modern machine learning frameworks and technologies (e.g., PyTorch, Tensorflow, Hugging Face, NumPy), as well as experience with distributed systems and cloud-based AI infrastructure
Strong problem-solving and strategic thinking abilities, with a proven ability to lead cross-functional teams and work collaboratively to deliver innovative AI solutions in production
A passion for driving AI adoption and pushing the boundaries of AI technology into real-world applications, with an ability to mentor junior engineers and influence strategic decisions across the organization


Perks & Benefits


We offer Cresta employees a variety of medical, dental, and vision plans, designed to fit you and your family’s needs
Paid parental leave to support you and your family
Monthly Health & Wellness allowance
Work from home office stipend to help you succeed in a remote environment
Lunch reimbursement for in-office employees

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$140,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Data Science team partners deeply with teams across Stripe to ensure that our users, our products, and our business have the models, data products, and insights needed to make decisions and grow responsibly. We’re looking for data scientists with a passion for analyzing data, building machine learning and statistical models, and running experiments to drive impact. Our work is broad and varied, influencing how our products work (e.g. understanding user needs, preventing fraud, or optimizing charge flows), how our business works (forecasting key outcomes, managing liquidity, quantifying risk exposure), how our go-to-market motions operate (designing growth experiments, optimizing marketing investments, refining sales processes, and estimating causal effects), and everything in between. We have a variety of Data Science roles and teams across Stripe and will seek to align you to the most relevant team based on your background.

What you'll do

We’re looking for a variety of Data Scientists to partner with the Product, Finance, Payments, Risk, Growth and Go-to-Market teams. You’ll work closely with a specific part of the business, playing a crucial role in optimizing our systems and leveraging data to make strategic business decisions. As Data Scientists as Stripe, it’s our mission to ensure that the company strategy, products, and user interactions make smart use of our rich data, using techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, causal inference, optimization, experimentation, and all forms of analytics.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


3-8+ years of data science/quantitative modeling experience
Proficiency in SQL and a computing language such as Python or R
Strong knowledge and hands-on experience in several of the following areas: machine learning, statistics, optimization, product analytics, causal inference, and/or experimentation
Experience in working with cross-functional teams to deliver results
Ability to communicate results clearly and a focus on driving impact
A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with a high attention to detail
Solid business acumen and experience in synthesizing complex analyses into actionable recommendations
A builder's mindset with a willingness to question assumptions and conventional wisdom



Preferred Qualifications


Experience deploying models in production and adjusting model thresholds to improve performance
Experience designing, running, and analyzing complex experiments or leveraging causal inference designs
Experience with distributed tools such as Spark, Hadoop, etc.
A PhD or MS in a quantitative field (e.g., Statistics, Engineering, Mathematics, Economics, Quantitative Finance, Sciences, Operations Research)



Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$140,000 - C$262,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Specific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.

We are home to some of the world's leading experts on autonomous vehicles, creating solutions such as Oxa Driver, equipping vehicles with full self-driving functionality; Oxa MetaDriver, using Generative AI to accelerate and assure the safety of deployments; and Oxa Hub, a set of cloud-based offerings for autonomous fleet management. Our technology is being deployed across the UK and the U.S, and we're partnering with a fast-growing ecosystem of operators, vehicle OEMs and equipment makers serving autonomous transportation globally as it advances.

Based in Oxford, and with offices in Canada and the U.S, Oxa was founded in 2014 and is  growing rapidly (350+ ‘Oxbots' to date). Our purpose is to change the way the Earth moves, through an uncompromising focus on safety, efficiency and explainability of our AI approaches. The company has attracted $225 million from leading investors so far, with $140 million raised in the last Series C funding round in January 2023.

Your Team

Oxa Foundry is a suite of tools that combines generative AI, digital twins and simulation to accelerate machine learning and testing of self-driving technology before and during real-world use.Tools within Oxa Foundry are also unlocking new opportunities to launch innovative solutions for industries such as commercial fleet insurance and risk management. Leveraging Oxa's experience of deploying AVs and establishing capabilities to safely scale (by identifying, quantifying and managing route risk with limited or no pre-existing data), we are helping organisations in those markets augment and generate new data to develop transformative fleet risk management solutions for their own customers.

Your team will ensure the company has enough data of the right kind and the right time from the right sources to sustain rapid improvement across all its tools. It will ensure suitable data ownership across our own fleet and via our customers and partners using data synthesis and expansion, simulation, automatic annotation and logging where appropriate.

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.

We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.

Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.

Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.

Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts. As Quandronauts, we’re committed to building a company that is diverse and multi-faceted. We’ve raised venture capital from top US and Canadian investors to help us achieve our mission, and are now scaling to achieve this.

About the Role:

At Quandri, we're embarking on an exciting journey to transform the workforce through automation, powered by AI and robotics. We're looking for a ML/AI Engineer to join our team. This role presents a unique opportunity to design and build cutting-edge machine learning and AI-driven solutions from the ground up.

Our guiding principles:


Customers at the core. We put the customer at the center of all we do. At a basic level, we believe business success comes down to talking to customers and building something they want. We don’t listen to customers and just take what they say blindly, but we think critically about it and build what they need. Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated

Our Renewal Intelligence Platform is designed to help brokerages save time, increase profitability, and drive better outcomes for their staff, clients, and business.

We saw 3x ARR growth last year and have plans to continue to grow both revenue and our team this year. Named one of LinkedIn’s Top Canadian Startups in 2024, we have already made a big impact on the insurance industry. However, what matters most is making our customer’s lives better one renewal at a time. We want you to be a critical part of that journey! We’re a hybrid company, with ⅔ of our team in Vancouver and the rest distributed. For those in Vancouver, we have an office in Gastown that we expect people to be at three days a week. We understand both the advantages of some flexibility around personal lives, and the positive interpersonal effects of in-person collaboration.

Running a profitable personal lines book of business is harder than ever for insurance brokerages. Market conditions, rising costs, talent shortages, and staffing constraints are just some of the challenges that hinder profit margins, scalability, and exceptional client service. Trusted by 5 of Canada’s top 10 brokerages, Quandri is transforming the renewal process with AI-driven automation, enabling proactive workflows and delivering data-driven insights.

Today’s renewal process is often reactive, with brokers focusing on clients who request help rather than adopting a proactive, data-driven approach. Quandri is revolutionizing renewals by offering a platform that uses AI and automation to streamline operations. This allows brokerages to retain more business, enhance client and staff experiences, reduce E&O risk, and boost sales through upselling and cross-selling.

Are you looking to make an impact in your next role? How about transforming an entire industry? At Quandri, we’re unlocking new frontiers in insurance. To do that, we model our culture as a crew of interstellar astronauts. As Quandronauts, we’re committed to building a company that is diverse and multi-faceted.

Customers are the core of everything we do, and our business exists to serve them. We prioritize their needs over all else within the company
Move with urgency. There are times when we need to move slowly and deliberately, but we default to acting fast and with urgency. We slow down when necessary, but this should be a deliberate choice. Businesses become more lethargic as they grow, this principle is designed to fight this fact
Be curious. We understand the world by being curious and asking why. We aren’t satisfied with surface level understanding, and seek a deeper understanding of why things are the way they are. Don’t take someone’s word for it or the answer “because that’s how we do it.” Understand why and dig deep
Excellence in execution. We know that what separates good from great is a high level of execution. We commit ourselves to excellence in everything that we do, from delivering an amazing product to writing a great email
Act like an owner. We’re all owners of the business and act like it. We follow through on commitments, own our results and think long-term
Fight for simplicity. The law of increasing functional information states that systems evolve to become more complex over time. At Quandri, we believe there is sophistication in simplicity; as such, we intentionally fight for streamlined solutions and are committed to the uncomplicated
